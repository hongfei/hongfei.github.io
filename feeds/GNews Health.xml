But increasingly, evidence points to another culprit that can harm cardiovascular health. Most of us are not aware and never would have thought that this, could also be the reason of heart attacks that are increasing by the second. Modern foods and lifestyle patterns are quietly undermining the body's capacity for nitric oxide production, a molecule that is essential for keeping blood vessels functional and the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Berg, a trained wellness expert and best-selling author, warns about how a potential decrease in nitric oxide can significantly lead to heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Beware!

Some food naturally encourages its production and maintains blood vessel health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food that aids nitric oxide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, arugula, and kale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beets and beet juice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garlic and onions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citrus fruits, particularly lemons and oranges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds, particularly those rich in arginine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate (with high cocoa content)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle habits that nourish nitric oxide:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistent physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quality sleep every night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting enough sunlight, which nourishes nitric oxide through chemistry of the skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress management through breathing, nature walks, or quiet rituals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst enemies of heart health are not necessarily the most apparent ones. Sometimes, we need to look away from the obvious food items to know what is actually harming our heart and body. Refined sugar, processed starches, industrial seed oils, smoking, and even run-of-the-mill mouthwash can sneakily compromise the body's nitric oxide production capability. This degrades the blood vessels and enhances the risk of cardiovascular disease in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxNa3BZVlFJZmZQd3h5dW9iM29UOUlUekNkcWhhR0F3eU1YVVdOZ19mVXlGZlBKVF9kOGtzdnp0bGJ3VS1CQ2RJSFZyWmluQjFHT1FZbVJtT242N2dJVXdsN016ZGlHNC1KTjN6VG9rTjU1ckV5U0xiWlN5ZG9JbEltUHdJalAyQnk0MlBydGF6bl96Wk1zVHV1cUdkM0RIWERMWi1leGxrNkJYT2NQbnQyLWNLbXRwYWJybjFjeXYwZ3VJVjBCWDlxcVZFbGg3TXlpU2xqNklQcHB5SWZaaWRzTS1KTjVYMjAwSHdLaGVfc19nSUptVFpr</guid></item><item><title>科学家在新研究中揭示了杀死癌细胞的单一运动-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15088973/single-exercise-kills-breast-cancer-cells-scientists-reveal.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the most tried and true health advice: regular exercise is key to warding off obesity, aging and chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mountains of research also shows working out just a few days a week could slash the risk of dying from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-d5d8c730-8f1e-11f0-8349-2b5d94e39299"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a new study has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15039727/workout-two-decades-life-heart-health-cardio.html"&gt;pinpointed a specific workout routine&lt;/a&gt; shown to slow the growth of cancer cells, even after just one session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in Australia recruited women who had survived breast cancer and had them undergo a single bout of either resistance training, such as weightlifting, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which involves short, intense bursts of exercise followed by short breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that immediately after one 45-minute resistance training or HIIT routine, participants showed up to 47 percent higher myokines in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myokines are proteins released by skeletal muscle cells during exercise that help muscles communicate with the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have also been shown to regulate metabolism and suppress molecules that cause inflammation, a key driver in cancer cell formation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team estimated that the increased myokines produced may slow cancer growth by 20 to 30 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Australia found resistance training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may slow cancer cell growth (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Francesco Bettariga, lead study researcher and PhD student at Edith Cowan University in Australia, told the Daily Mail: 'By demonstrating anti-cancer effects at the cellular level, our results provide a potential explanation for why exercise reduces the risk of cancer progression, recurrence, and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While our study has limitations and further in vivo work is needed, these findings highlight how exercise could contribute to improved survival outcomes in people with cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this summer in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-025-07772-w"&gt;Breast Cancer Research and Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 32 patients who had been treated for breast cancer, ranging from stage one to stage three, at least four months beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest cancer stage group was stage two (41 percent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 59 with a body mass index (BMI) of 28, which is considered overweight but not obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the resistance training group completed eight repetitions of five sets of exercises for major muscle groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included chest press, seated row, shoulder press, lateral pulldown, leg press, leg extension, leg curl and lunges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group got one to two minutes between sets to rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the HIIT group, participants performed seven 30-second bouts of high-intensity exercise on at least three of the following exercise machines: stationary bike, treadmill, rower and cross-trainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had three-minute rest periods between sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website: 'We selected two distinct exercise modalities—resistance and aerobic training—because they provide different physiological benefits: resistance training improves muscle strength, while aerobic training enhances cardiorespiratory fitness in order to determine which exercise could drive greater cancer-suppressive effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specifically, we used a high-intensity exercise to determine whether greater intensity could amplify these anti-cancer effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both groups completed about 45 minutes of exercise in total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed blood tests on participants at three separate times: before working out, immediately following the sessions and 30 minutes after working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that completing either the resistance or HIIT regimen just one time increased levels of myokines in participants' blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest jump was in the myokine IL-6, which increased 47 percent in the HIIT group immediately after exercise. Myokine IL-6 is a protein released from muscles during exercise that plays a crucial role in immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the resistance group showed a 23 percent increase in decorin, a myokin that regulates tissue growth, and a nine percent increase in IL-6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found myokine levels gradually decreased over time after participants finished working out, though they remained elevated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on results, researchers estimated the myokine levels produced from exercising could reduce the growth of cancer cells by 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myokines have been shown to suppress inflammatory proteins called cytokines. Cytokines are secreted by immune cells to control inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, high cytokine levels can trigger excess inflammation, which damages cell DNA and increases the risk of cancer cells forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease, striking 311,000 US women every year and killing 42,000 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A recent study in JAMA found that breast cancer rates went up by about 0.79 percent each year during the study from from 2000 to 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga said: 'We found that both resistance training and HIIT increased the release of myokines with anti-cancer properties after just a single exercise session. We then observed a reduction of up to 30 percent in cancer cell growth in [lab testing]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What stood out was that both modalities had comparable effects, suggesting that exercise intensity is the main driver of these anti-cancer changes, rather than the specific type of exercise performed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer strikes 311,000 American women every year and kills 42,000, according to the American cancer society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the disease generally has a high survival rate of 92 percent, that rate can drop as low as 33 percent if cancer cells spread to other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also on the rise among young women, with rates increasing by 0.8 percent every year from 2000 to 2019, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14177967/breast-cancer-rising-doctors-warn-american-women-report.html"&gt;one study suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have tied this rise to hormone-disrupting chemicals and early menstruation, which can increase exposure to hormones like estrogen that can fuel breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the new study results are promising for breast cancer, it's unclear if they would translate to other forms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettargia said: 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Surprisingly, no studies with this specific design had been conducted in this population, making our findings highly relevant to millions of women living with breast cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the small sample size and focusing on only one form of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website that the team next plans to investigate these effects in other types of cancer and groups of people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Furthermore, it is now time to examine the effects of regular, long-term exercise programs on these anti-cancer responses. We also aim to explore additional mechanisms particularly the role of the immune system, which plays a crucial part in controlling cancer cell growth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE WORST &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;JUICE CLEANSES: 1/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While juice cleanses have become all the rage over the past decade or so after gaining mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, many health experts are less excited about the concept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other diets, a juice cleanse is a temporary dietary regimen that involves consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a predetermined period, typically ranging from a few days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often promoted as a way to detoxify the body, lose weight, and improve overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based personal trainer Natalie Alex told this website: 'More recently overly restrictive "detoxes" or juice cleanses often promise quick fixes but leave people depleted, with results that rarely last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These fads tend to ignore balance and sustainability, which is why people so often rebound after them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, New York dermatologist Dr Michele Green isn't a fan of juice cleanses and she gives them just a one out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unlike other diets, a juice cleanse is a temporary dietary regimen that involves consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a predetermined period, typically ranging from a few days to a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Detox diets, including juice cleanses and liquid cleanses, are also not sustainable and often do not provide enough daily nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These extreme diets lack scientific support. Additionally, the body is equipped with mechanisms and organs that effectively flush out potential toxins without the need for detox diets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health also warns of the dangers of juice cleanses, with some of the side effects including 'dangerous electrolyte imbalances', headaches, fainting, weakness, and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;THE KETO DIET: 2/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many health experts Daily Mail spoke to rated the keto diet as one of the worst eating regimens from the past century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy by Dr Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was designed to mimic the effects of fasting by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption. This helps to manage epilepsy by inducing a metabolic state called ketosis, when the body burns fat energy instead of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ketosis has been shown to have an anti-seizure effect in people with epilepsy, though the mechanism behind the connection is not fully understood. It could be a change in brain chemistry, change in neuronal activity or improvement in cell function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet encourages followers to eat butter, avocado, coconut, bacon, cream, cheese and some nuts but avoid grains, milk, yogurt, most fruits, legumes, potatoes and many vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Keto diet encourages the consumption of meats, butter and cheese&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Dietitian's Association of Australia, keto diet isn't recommended for the general population as the long-term efficacy and safety of the diet are unknown, having only been studied in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sophie Scott, who is a nutritionist based out of Australia, gave the keto diet a two out of 10 in terms of its effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Keto forces the body to use fat (or more specifically, ketones) as the main fuel source instead of glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Carbohydrates are severely restricted to around 50g per day (equivalent to two slices of bread and a banana) and fat constitutes 70 percent of this diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association also does not recommend the diet for long-term success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the organization explain: 'In studies up to six months long, improvements in body weight and blood sugar have been shown with these diets. However, after a year, most improvements were no different from the results of a less restrictive diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Restrictions on fruits, whole grains and legumes may result in reduced fiber intake. Additionally, these diets are high in fat without limiting saturated fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consuming high levels of saturated fat and low levels of fiber are both linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;SOUTH  BEACH DIET: 3/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The South Beach Diet focuses on eliminating refined carbs and prioritizing healthy fats like olive oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The South Beach Diet was developed in the mid-1990s by Dr Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist, to help his patients with heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It gained widespread popularity in 2003 with the release of his best-selling book, The South Beach Diet, which explained the diet's principles for weight loss and improved health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet focuses on eliminating refined carbs and prioritizing healthy fats like olive oil. However, the experts warn that like keto, it can be restrictive and for this reason, they give it a three out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first phase, which lasts for 14 days, involves eating three meals and two snacks daily, mainly protein and non-starchy vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, participants add small amounts of whole grains and fruits, as well as small amounts of alcohol. This phase lasts as long as it takes you to reach your goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the final phase, no food is off limits, but participants pay strict attention to serving sizes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The South Beach Diet says that you'll lose 8lbs to 13lbs during phase one, with most of the weight coming from your midsection. In phase two, it says that you'll likely lose 1lb to 2lbs per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no research suggesting that the South Beach diet leads to long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon Palmer, a dietitian at the Plant-Powered Dietitian, said: 'This diet would be hard to follow in the context of cultural diets, and it reinforces diet culture. I would not recommend this diet overall for weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE BEST &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and olive oil, and features moderate amounts of fish and poultry - and the occasional glass of red wine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long touted by health experts as the secret to a lengthy, healthy life, the Mediterranean diet has been crowned one of the healthiest nutritional plans for promoting an approach to healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the Mediterranean diet was first coined in the 1960s by American biologist Ancel Keys, but its origins trace back to ancient times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and olive oil, and features moderate amounts of fish and poultry - and the occasional glass of red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet eliminates added sugars, refined grains like white breads and pasta, trans fats like in margarine, canola oil and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionist Sophie Scott told Daily Mail: 'The diet is a 10 out of 10 because it is more of an eating pattern, rather than a prescriptive diet, which makes it easier to follow consistently than other more restrictive diets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She referenced a research paper that found the diet consistently performs well in relation to weight loss, reduction in cardiovascular disease and reduction of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The PREDIMED study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013, showed the Mediterranean diet group had a third less heart disease, diabetes and stroke than the low-fat group. They also lost a little weight and had less memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The benefits can't be narrowed down to one single food or factor but to some general themes,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Extra fiber, a diverse range of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and legumes, yoghurts and cheese, small amounts of fish and meat, red wine, nuts and seeds and good quality olive oil all played their part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the authors believe that the olive oil itself was the most powerful single factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fitness expert Natalie Alex is also a fan of the Mediterranean diet, as she says it is less of a fad and more of a lifestyle. She gives it a nine out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'It supports both long-term health and enjoyment of food, which is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And on the fitness front, the shift toward higher-protein, strength-supporting nutrition in recent years has been beneficial for people looking to maintain lean mass and metabolic health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harvard researchers found that people who followed the DASH diet for 30 years had a 14 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and strokes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;THE DASH DIET: 8.5/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beloved by many health experts, the DASH diet was introduced in 1997 by NIH-supported research teams and it was designed to reduce high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have since shown that the DASH diet can have positive effects on cardiovascular health and may have other health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eating plan encourages eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It favors lean sources of protein, like beans and lean meats, and suggests limiting saturated fats and sugar-sweetened food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the American Heart Association rate this diet at 8.5 out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explain: 'The DASH-style eating pattern received a perfect score by meeting all of the Association's guidance. These eating patterns are low in salt, added sugar, alcohol, tropical oils and processed foods, and rich in non-starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Protein tends to be mostly from plant sources (such as legumes, beans or nuts), along with fish or seafood, lean poultry and meats, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard researchers found that people who followed the diet for 30 years had a 14 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and strokes compared to people on a standard diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York cosmetic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.michelegreenmd.com/botox-nyc"&gt;dermatologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr Michele Green says the DASH diet is also 'excellent' for the skin, as it limits processed sugar and unhealthy fats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'You really notice a glow on this plan,' she adds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;WEIGHT WATCHERS: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Popularized by dozens of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Kate Hudson, Weight Watchers doesn't involve counting calories. Instead, foods are assigned a certain amount of points based on their nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the top of the diet list with many health experts is the old American favorite diet, Weight Watchers. It got a seven out of 10 overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Introduced in 1963 by Jean Nidetch in New York, it started as a small social support group for friends to lose weight together and today it has more than 3.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popularized by dozens of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Kate Hudson, Weight Watchers doesn't involve counting calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, foods are assigned a certain amount of points based on their nutrients, such as fiber, added sugars, protein, and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods with more unhealthy nutrients like added sugars and fat, and too little of vital compounds like fiber, are assigned more points. Dieters are allotted a specific amount of points to use daily and weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doug Cook, a registered dietitian in Toronto, told US News and World Report: 'Weight Watchers helps people to understand balance in so far that no food is off limits, helping it to be sustainable in the long run. It focuses on wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, etc.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the BMJ involving 740 overweight or obese participants found that those who used Weight Watchers lost the most weight compared to those on other diets, dropping an average of 9.8lbs after 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, in a review of 45 studies, researchers found that after 12 months of Weight Watchers, members lost 2.6 percent more weight than those who received no weight loss guidance or education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE OLD RELIABLE - 10/10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Instead of a fad diet or brand, the experts say having a grasp of what eating well looks like is of utmost importance and maintaining a healthy balance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When quizzed about which diet has stood the test of time as the 'old reliable,' the health experts revealed a surprising answer: 'just a balanced diet.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of a fad diet or costly branded products, they say having a grasp of what eating well looks like is of utmost importance when it comes to keeping in shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Los Angeles-based Dr Raj Dasgupta told this website: 'The one approach that never goes out of style is eating a variety of real, unprocessed foods, watching portions, and moving your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not flashy, but it's reliable and backed by decades of solid research.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends stocking up on plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats while limiting ultra-processed foods and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michele Green says from her own experience too, a diet in moderation is the one that has always worked best for her. She says eliminating certain food groups can often lead to people giving up and creating an unhealthy relationship with food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'While I think it is important to reduce the consumption of sugary foods, sweets do not need to be cut out completely and can be consumed in moderation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, fitness trainer Natalie Alex concludes: 'Looking ahead, I think we'll see less focus on rigid diets and more emphasis on personalized nutrition plans built around someone's lifestyle, preferences, and health needs, instead of strict rules that are hard to follow long-term.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At 28, she had taken on a unit in Chester to convert into a yoga studio, poured in all her savings and hired teachers, while at the same time working as a personal trainer. Her days started at 5am; she was driven, stressed, excited, and had no time for the back pain that just would not subside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It kept moving around,” she says. “Every day it would be in a different part of my back. I was strapping on heat packs and ice packs just to get to work.” Smith saw her GP, her physiotherapist and a chiropractor, all of whom suspected a torn muscle. “What really worried me,” she says, “the worst-case scenario, was a slipped disc.” One day in March 2020, the pain was so intense that Smith took to her bed, fell asleep and woke with a crashing migraine and blurred vision. Her mum took her to the optician who shone a light behind Smith’s eyes, saw haemorrhaging and sent her straight to the hospital. Once there, Smith was admitted, and over the course of a week, had an MRI, a CT scan, and a biopsy taken from the cells in her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/lung-cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Lung cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/youngpeople","type":"Keyword","title":"Young people"},{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/anna-moore","type":"Contributor","title":"Anna Moore"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/sep/14/lung-cancer-young-fit-non-smoking-women","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith was alone in her bed when two doctors appeared, closed the curtains, and told her that she had cancer in her lungs that had spread down her spine and up into her brain. It was stage four. “They said there was nothing they could do for me,” says Smith. “All I remember is ringing my mum and screaming down the phone. The doctors told my parents that I probably had about two weeks to live.” This was the early days of Covid, and Smith chose to go home for palliative care. “I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out, as you do when you go through trauma,” says Smith. “My friends all came to say goodbye. They were sitting at the end of my bed crying their eyes out. I’ve still got a whole book of the letters they wrote me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72976a7b-8a38-4cc5-8926-df6ead2255a9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Becca Smith had planned to open a yoga studio before she became ill. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, lung cancer has been viewed as a disease of older men, a “smokers’ disease”, heavily stigmatised and until very recently, grossly underfunded. &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/research-and-discoveries/cancer-blogs/detail/science-talk/let-s-work-together-to-end-the-stigma-around-lung-cancer#:~:text=The%20stigma%20around%20the%20disease,account%20the%20burden%20of%20disease." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One analysis from 2010&lt;/a&gt; found it received only 6% of cancer research funding, despite being the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/lung-cancer#lung_stats0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;third most common cancer in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent years though, the patient profile has shifted. Smoking remains the main risk factor, but cases among fit, young, non-smoking women have risen, both as a proportion and in absolute numbers. And while screening is now available in England for those over 55 with a history of smoking – &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/the-devil-is-in-the-detail-our-response-to-the-10-year-health-plan/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;76% of the lung cancer cases identified by screening are at stage one or two and &lt;/a&gt;potentially curable – young, non-smoking women like Smith tend to be diagnosed only after the cancer has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Alex Georgiou, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital, has analysed the data of his lung cancer patients to understand these changes. “Between 2010 and 2021, the number of patients at our clinic who haven’t smoked has increased every year,” he says. “In 2010, it was 5% of cases. By 2021, it was 14%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of these non-smoking lung cancer cases, 68% were women, compared with 43% of those with a history of smoking. There was also a higher proportion of younger patients: 16% of the non-smoking patients were aged below 50 compared with 5% from the smoking group – and more Black and Asian patients too. White people made up 72% of the smoking cases, compared with just 44% of the non-smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We might expect a high proportion of Asian patients, as non-smoking lung cancer is very prevalent in south-east Asia,” says Georgiou. “But the higher number of black patients is less recognised. They made up 17% of the non-smoking cases versus 5% from the group with a smoking history.” There were also clear differences in stage of presentation and disease progression. Two-thirds of the non-smoking patients presented at stage four, the most advanced stage, and 38% had cancer that had spread to the brain. “It’s not only that the demographics are different,” says Georgiou. “The biology of the cancer is different too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These findings reflect worldwide trends but, as yet, none of it is fully understood. According to Cecilia Pompili, a thoracic surgeon and clinical senior lecturer at Hull York Medical School, we are just beginning to ask the questions. “For so long, we didn’t think of lung cancer as a disease of young women and often haven’t even included them in clinical research trials,” she says. (For example, &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerstoday.com/post/dr-narjust-florez-on-the-reality-of-lung-cancer-in-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;men have made up 65% of participants&lt;/a&gt; in groundbreaking immunotherapy trials for lung cancer.) Pompili is interviewing women with lung cancer about their early symptoms and diagnosis pathway, for a study funded by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer diagnosed in non-smokers, and while some women experience the “classic” persistent cough, and also coughing up blood, for others, symptoms are more vague and non-specific, such as weight loss, or back pain. “We want to understand the symptom trajectory and also whether women are treated differently by their health provider,” says Pompili. “We know from some patients that a 40-year-old, fit woman with a persistent cough is more likely to be diagnosed with an allergy, asthma or an infection than an older male smoker who will be sent for a chest X-ray.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Identifying why lung cancer is rising in women requires much more research, says Pompili. Hormones could play a part. Worldwide, indoor air pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and biomass fuels used for cooking and heating has been identified as a significant risk factor. In the UK, &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/learn-about-lung-cancer/lung-cancer-risk-factors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outdoor air pollution is believed to cause around one in 10 lung cancers&lt;/a&gt;. “Air pollution has been demonstrated to be significant for both genders, especially in younger patients,” says Pompili. It’s possible that women’s smaller lungs and narrower airways lead to a higher concentration of pollutants and a greater likelihood of fine particulate matter – 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter – becoming trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella was the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate, is not surprised. “Ella had asthma but there are 700 diseases impacted by air pollution,” she says. “When I think of younger women with lung cancer, I wonder about the school run, the time sitting in cars or buses in heavy traffic. When I think about the higher number of black and brown people, I think of economics. Who takes buses, and waits at bus stops, and lives in social housing and cheaper housing close to main roads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“London is the most congested city in Europe. Worldwide, we are number five,” continues Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who campaigns for cleaner air through the &lt;a href="https://www.ellaroberta.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ella Roberta Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “Yet somehow, officially, Ella is still the only person who has died because of air pollution. We’ve got to the point where the burden of ill health caused by air pollution is so huge, I’m asking myself: ‘What will it take to make the public demand more action?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also key here – but again, not fully understood – is the role of genetic mutations, especially in younger non-smoking women. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common, &lt;a href="https://www.egfrpositive.org.uk/what-is-egfr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;believed to cause 10-15% of lung cancers in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2022-09-10_scientists-reveal-how-air-pollution-can-cause-lung-cancer-in-people-who-have-never-smoked" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified how air pollution might “wake up” dormant cells in the lungs that carry these cancer-causing mutations, promoting their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah Li, a 42-year-old freelance film-maker, was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer last year. A non-smoker and a vegan, Li lives in London and was signed up for her seventh marathon at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’d had a persistent cough but I wasn’t worried,” she says. “I’d had a cold first and the cough just seemed to come off the back of it.” Li was also experiencing pain in her right shoulder. “Looking back, that was another symptom but I didn’t know enough to join the dots.” A physio suggested shoulder exercises and a pharmacist sold Li syrup for her cough. After four months though, as the cough worsened, Li saw her GP, expecting antibiotics for a chest infection. Instead, she was referred for a chest X-ray, then fast-tracked for a CT scan. In April 2024, Li learned she had inoperable lung cancer, with a tumour on her left lung, and cancer also present in nodules in her right lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even now, I find it strange when I say I have lung cancer,” says Li. “I can say I have cancer – so many people get cancer – but the idea of lung cancer still feels quite foreign. How am I the face of lung cancer? When I was first diagnosed, I went through everything, asking: ‘Why? What did I do?’ I think I led a healthy lifestyle, but I lived in India for four years, in Hyderabad, a busy city. I feel strange blaming any one thing or focusing on what I might have done wrong. Nobody wants this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8bb545b7-c72b-42d1-bad6-a93d4588e814" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sarah Li was diagnosed with lung cancer last year.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although Li had only been with her partner Robin for 18 months, they had to have difficult conversations about fertility and future children. “Did I want to freeze my eggs before treatment? We decided it was better to keep me alive and start treatment as soon as possible.” In fact, the impact of lung cancer on fertility has only just become an area of research. The International Pregnancy and Lung &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Registry was launched in December 2023. “Understanding how lung cancer and its treatment impacts young women in all ways – their whole lives, their fertility, their young family and caring responsibilities, their career, is only just beginning,” says Pompili. “It’s something we have done for breast cancer – but not lung cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After years of underfunding (widely attributed to lung cancer’s link with smoking), pioneering treatments are developing fast – especially for cancers like Li’s, driven by genetic mutations. In the last decade, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has &lt;a href="https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/nices-increasing-cancer-treatment-recommendations#:~:text=Since%202015%2C%20NICE%20has%20made,immune%20system%20to%20combat%20cancer." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended 48 new treatments&lt;/a&gt; for lung cancer – six times more than in the previous decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Li’s first round of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy led to massive reductions in her tumours. However, in January, a small lesion was found on her brain. She is now having a targeted therapy – a daily pill – and more chemo. “Life is more intense now,” she says. “There’s more vividness to everything. Like today, I’m just so happy that I’m feeling well enough to be outside, to have a nice lunch. Those little things you take for granted … you’re just way more appreciative of it all. The idea of talking about ‘two years’ time’ or ‘five years’ time’ like my friends do? I can’t. I know that eventually the cancer will outsmart the treatment I’m on. Hopefully, by then, there’ll be another treatment pathway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is in the same position. A few weeks into her palliative care, the family were informed by phone that the biopsy taken from Smith’s back showed a genetic mutation, ALK-positive lung cancer, and a treatment was available. She began taking eight tablets a day – targeted cancer drugs, ALK inhibitors – with monthly blood tests and scans every three months. “It went well, there was a big reduction in cancer,” she says. “After two years, I got some progression in my brain, so I’m on the second line of treatment now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Explaining her disease to others is exhausting. “You always get the same reaction,” she says. “‘But you don’t smoke?’ ‘You’re so young?’ There’s such a community around breast cancer – more power to it – but with lung cancer, there really isn’t. It feels like it’s just you.” This is despite the fact that the disease &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Fact-Sheet-2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kills as many women&lt;/a&gt; as breast, ovarian and cervical cancers combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is a pilates teacher now – this summer, she went on a yoga retreat in Bali. Her partner, Sammy, flew out to join her in July and, during a walk on the beach, he proposed. “This is my dream. I’m enjoying my life,” she says. “I’ve gone through so much. I lost the yoga studio, I lost a lot of money, but the things you think matter? They really don’t. All I care about is my family and friends, and being happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I still feel sadness and I’m scared – I’m terrified because I don’t know what’s to come,” she continues. “Scans never get easier, but you get better at dealing with them. It’s a cliche but I genuinely live for today now – and five years on, I’ve finally reached a stage where I can be grateful for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2dBWngtTDM2Q2hnc0kzNXI4UE9OVzcwS1ZGQmpFQjNYenI0X0xVZkp6bnp4QVYzWHdJVkJEOFU4c3otVWw5WHBMNzF6MHB3SEcxSWFHN1FGYnA5Yk9WNTBYdGc2amdIN0sxSnVoUU9lYWlaUlNDeXBfd0VMY0xvTEN0M1FtLWJUSmdLNWdSczY</guid></item><item><title>现在每个人都有一个中国肽经销商-旧金山标准</title><link>https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/14/everyone-has-chinese-peptide-dealer-now/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-grid article-content"&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;On an August morning, among the marble columns and Tuscan frescoes in the Fairmont Hotel’s Laurel Court restaurant, a back table became an impromptu chemistry class. Lynne Ji, a slim 27-year-old dressed in black athleisure, moved aside a china teapot, unzipped a black business-class airline pouch, and tipped an array of glass vials onto the table. They contained powdered and liquid versions of the peptide retatrutide, a next-generation GLP-1 compound made by pharma giant Eli Lilly, currently in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05931367"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. It was getting a lot of buzz in her group chats, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji, a retired poker pro who dabbles in crypto, began microdosing retatrutide in February. Within days, she said, her “food noise” faded, her portions shrank, and her weight dropped from 135 to 115 pounds. “I am exactly vain enough to inject myself to look thinner,” she said. “I played poker for a career, so taking risks doesn’t bother me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji’s stash didn’t come from a pharmacy but from a Chinese peptide dealer she’d been connected to on WhatsApp by tech friends. She paid the guy $195 for 10 vials. “Three weeks later, it shows up at your door,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-full inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;A growing number of techies are injecting Chinese peptides for their purported health benefits, from improving libido to fat loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji’s approach to DIY dosing is part of a growing Bay Area trend that’s evolving beyond psychedelics and nootropics into needles and peptide stacks. This cohort of mostly tech industry people are injecting research-grade peptides in hopes of a health or performance boost to address everything from fat loss and recovery to focus and libido. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;A few years ago, most people didn’t know a peptide from a protein shake. Then came &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/prevention-wellness/spending-glp-1s-has-grown-dramatically-here-are-details"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which turned GLP-1s (glucagon-like peptides, originally designed to treat diabetes but repurposed for weight loss) into a household name. Serena Williams shills GLP-1s for the telehealth brand &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://ro.co/lp/weight-loss/quiz/serena/"&gt;Ro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;SF-based telehealth company Hims &amp;amp; Hers advertises microdosing GLP-1s on Muni buses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But GLP-1s, which mimic gut hormones to help regulate blood sugar, are only one branch of peptides, which are strings of amino acids that build proteins and act on certain cell types to change functions in the body. You’ll find peptides in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11762834/"&gt;luxury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; skincare serums and oral supplements, but doctors consider injection the gold standard for efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Enthusiasts stock up on peptides like BPC-157 (“body protection compound”) for &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6271067/"&gt;tendon and ligament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; healing; GHK-Cu, a copper peptide believed to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6073405/"&gt;increase collagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and hair growth; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7747025/"&gt;Thymosin alpha-1 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;(TA-1) for immune support; Selank to reduce &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/p1114-rapid-and-slow-response-during-treatment-of-generalized-anxiety-disorder-with-peptide-anxiolytic-selank/7A497218D37084BD079EFE143126F56E"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;; and Semax, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10218113/"&gt;developed for stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; recovery, for a brain boost. Some of these health claims are supported by small studies; others by little more than message-board testimonials. Regardless, for some DIY health experimenters, the term “peptide” has become synonymous with quick fixes and radical life upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="!p-0 !m-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;That DIY culture is colliding with a regulatory crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-full inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Superpower co-founder Max Marchione prepares a copper peptide injection from China at the company office in San Francisco. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Starting in 2023, the Food and Drug Administration began steadily restricting access to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://a4pc.org/news/2023-10/fda-puts-some-peptides-off-limits"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; peptides, moving several — including BPC-157, CJC-1295, and ipamorelin, which were formerly available from U.S. compounding pharmacies — into its &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/certain-bulk-drug-substances-use-compounding-may-present-significant-safety-risks"&gt;“Category 2 bucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” shorthand for bulk substances that “may present significant safety risks” like poor immune responses, and shouldn’t be compounded. (Some were removed from that list in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/october-29-2024-meeting-pharmacy-compounding-advisory-committee-10292024"&gt;2024.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary, has tweeted complaints about the FDA’s &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737"&gt;war on peptides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. But that has not led to any change to regulations or availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Health hackers have turned to the gray market to source their  vials from dealers in China, where most peptides are manufactured. These dealers sell vials labeled “not for human use.” Purchasing this way amounts to a regulatory hack that opens the Chinese supply chain to anyone with a credit card, under the fiction that the drugs are for laboratory use only. Chinese peptide imports from non-FDA registered companies rose 44% from December to January, according to the Partnership for Safe Medicines, a nonprofit &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.safemedicines.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PSM-White-Paper-v1-PUBLIC-VERSION.pdf"&gt;watchdog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Representatives for the FDA declined to comment but directed The Standard to the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/fdas-concerns-unapproved-glp-1-drugs-used-weight-loss"&gt;agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Concerns with Unapproved GLP-1 Drugs Used for Weight Loss, which warns against purchasing peptides labeled “for research purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR  inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="none"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Are peptides in the startup fridge the new company perk?&lt;span class="image-caption-divider"&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;Jason Henry for The Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Despite peptides being one of pop culture’s buzziest words right now – alongside Labubu and matcha —  they’re not a new phenomena. Peptides were discovered in humans in the 1920s, but it wasn’t until breakthrough synthesizing techniques were developed in the 1950s that scientists began studying their use in treating disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Thousands have been cataloged, and around 100 peptide-based drugs have made it to market, with 150 in active clinical trials. “Peptides are super important,” said pathology professor Katrin J. Svensson, who runs a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://svenssonlabstanford.org"&gt;metabolic regulation lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; at Stanford University.  “They often have fewer side effects than other types of drugs.” Since peptides are already present in the body, adding more is considered low risk, she added..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Research-grade peptides usually arrive as powders that require dilution with bacteriostatic water. But what shows up in the mail is anyone’s guess. “There is no regulation on the purity,” said Svensson. “It’s pretty dangerous.” Risks range from accidental overdose due to inconsistent labelling to vomiting and severe dehydration, or even sepsis, “if mixed in unsterile conditions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Even the first step, mixing, can be dicey, Svennsson warned; the math behind the dilution process, referred to as reconstitution, is complex enough to spawn countless online “peptide calculators.” Eyeballing a vial isn’t enough. “Holding the bottle up to the light doesn’t mean it’s actually dissolved,” she said. “You need an instrument to determine this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Tim Fitzgerald, who runs the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hocwc.com"&gt;Human Optimization Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a wellness spa in Walnut Creek offering cryotherapy, red-light therapy, and other treatments, began using peptides in 2016 after suffering a herniated disc and autoimmune issues he attributed to “vaccine injuries.” Within weeks, his pain was gone, he claims. He emphasizes lifestyle changes — “protein, training, sleep, light — all of it matters” — alongside “use as needed” peptide injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“It’s not a magic bullet,” he said. “Someone who’s a metabolic dumpster fire isn’t going to get the result just by hopping on a shot.” He has cycled through a few types of peptides; treating a condition called “small intestine bacterial overgrowth,” (SIBO), a concussion, and muscle healing. Recently, though, he took a break: “I was starting to feel a bit like a human pin cushion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading-block article-body text-left"&gt;The Peptide bros&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Marchione holding peptides from China he keeps in a fridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Max Marchione, the baby-faced 25-year-old cofounder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/11/04/new-tech-flex-longevity-concierge/" data-post-id="5fee25af-e32f-4d50-9448-6fcef0b4ab28"&gt;Superpower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a telehealth-for-longevity startup based in SoMa, isn’t fazed by the needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Before the company moved offices in September, the communal fridge doubled as a pharmacy. Mornings began with a ritual: Marchione lifting his shirt to swab his abs, cofounder Jacob Peters dropping trou to swab his butt, and Shaun Miller, the vice president of medical operations, alternating between hip and backside. (“I didn’t know people injected anywhere else,” said Peters.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Marchione started with peptides a few months ago but is already an evangelist. “All that matters is if I increase performance, even if it introduces a bit of short-term risk,” he reasoned, focusing on improvements in sleep, muscle gain, cognition, and immunity. “If that improves performance, it justifies it long term.” What hooked him was the contrast with supplements, which he could swallow daily and still feel no shift in energy, focus, or recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As none of his preferred peptides are approved by the FDA, Marchione buys products labeled “for research use only.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I get them from a Chinese peptide dealer,” he said. He’d prefer to source them domestically. “When you make something that people want hard to get, you create a black market,” said Miller. “The sentiment went from ‘I have my favorite compounding pharmacy’ to ‘I have my Chinese peptide dealer.’ If the supply wasn’t restricted, people would still be going the legitimate path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Miller’s $1,000-a-month peptide stack is small change next to Peters’ $5,000 (“It’s a lot of money, but it’s such a massive ROI,” said Peters.) and Miller’s $2,000. (Biohackers have a nickname for Miller’s four daily injections: the “Wolverine Stack.”) Marchione’s stack includes two shots in the morning and one at night, with others on an ad hoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As the hype over peptide efficacy outruns the data, Marchione has become an unexpected source of info for the community. His phone pings at all hours with sourcing and dosing questions from founders and investors. While The Standard watched, he pulled up a photo of a New York friend’s freezer jammed with tiny, color-capped vials. “That’s probably $100,000 to $250,000 worth of peptides,” he said. “Maybe more, in retail value. You gotta get on the peptide train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Hence the emergence of Superpower’s Peptide Friday. In June, the company began doling out syringes alongside coffee at its weekly all-hands breakfast for the 20 to 30 employees who work in the office. The lineup has included thymosin alpha-1 (often dubbed by fans as an “immune booster”) and NAD, a coenzyme known for supporting cellular repair. “It started as a joke,” said Marchione. But the company’s roughly 150 employees are into the free peptide shots, said VP of operations Adam Small, noting that it’s a good way to get more folks to come into the office to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Many purchasers of gray-market Chinese peptides have complained about the wildly varying quality. This infuriated Michael Carter, the San Francisco-based founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://Play.co"&gt;Play.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a mobile gaming startup. After he re-injured his back in 2024, friends suggested peptides. He felt a lot better but hated buying from a sketchy website. “I don’t want to inject some crazy thing,” he said. “You’re opting out of the FDA, but you don’t want to opt out of supply chain safety.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;In March, he launched &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.finnrick.com/"&gt;Finnrick,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; a peptide-testing platform backed by AngelList founder Naval Ravikant; Cameron Teitelman of StartX, Stanford University’s innovation accelerator; and Walter Kortschak, a venture capitalist and early investor in Lyft, Robinhood, and Palantir. “I made the investment in the belief this is a rapidly growing market,” said Kortschak. “Having more transparency [provides] great benefits to everyone.” Consumers mail in their vials, and the samples get sent to labs for free testing (similar labs &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://janoshik.com/pricing/"&gt;charge fees)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of purity, quantity, and potency. Finnrick also buys batches itself, taking steps to conceal its identity from the sellers. For each sample, the verdict comes back — a grade of A through E, with A the best — and is published online. Paid subscribers get extra analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Finnrick has tested 2,378 samples (with another 1,500 in the queue) of 15 types of peptides from 122 vendors. The lab found zero semaglutide in five of the six vials tested from one vendor, and the sixth had 5% extra product, which could lead to accidental overdosing (earning that company an E grade).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We get emails from vendors demanding we take the data down,” said Carter. He doesn’t. The project doesn’t make unapproved drugs safe, but it makes the risk more legible. “Everyone has a peptide guy,” he said. “What people need is transparent information so they can make their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Not everyone is sourcing their peptides themselves. Some concierge doctors offer non-FDA-approved peptides via overseas channels, domestic “research use only” sellers, or via the small number of compounding pharmacies allowed to serve licensed clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I’m only as good as my compounder,” said Dr. Bronwyn Holmes, a San Francisco specialist  in anti-aging and pediatrics who sits on the medical advisory board at Eden Health, a telehealth platform. Holmes has prescribed peptides since 2018, often BPC-157 and thymosin for women recovering from cosmetic surgery and GLP-1s for weight loss. Around 20% of her weight-loss patients are on retatrutide, the investigational peptide. “I see an uptick in, ‘Hey, I saw this on a podcast. What do you think?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Dr. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmolly.co/"&gt;Molly Maloof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a Bay Area physician who has lectured at Stanford University and specializes in treating tech executives, is all in on mainstreaming peptides. “I’m bullish, because I believe peptides are medicine for health and not just disease,” she said. “We’re going to see a lot of the gray market become the white market in the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Maloof has a proactive approach to peptides: “I don’t recommend anything to patients I haven’t tested myself,” she said, describing four daily injections. The standout has been Selank, an &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5322660/"&gt;anti-anxiety peptide,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; designed to calm the nervous system without sedation while potentially boosting focus and memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“My god. You definitely notice a major shift — your brain just feels smooth,” she said. “It’s so nice.” To source quality peptides, Maloof visits labs, verifies supply chains, and pushes chemists for proof via batch numbers, test methods, and results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But Maloof and Holmes are concierge doctors with concierge pricing. For people without sufficient money or connections, the fallback is usually a sketchy website they heard about on a podcast. A thirtysomething San Francisco-based engineer told me they flew to Mexico for injections “from a witch.” Another sourced a dealer via Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji, the retired poker player, doesn’t pretend peptides are risk-free. “I’m almost certain this is not a miracle drug that has zero long-term damage,” she said of microdosed retatrutide. She has also tried semaglutide and BPC-157. She worries friends are taking unnecessarily high doses. But for the most part, the curiosity outpaces the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“Under 20% of my friends do it,” she said. A higher number have pulled the trigger on peptide purchases, but not on the syringe. “They mentally put it on hold. They don’t really care, as they’re in pretty good shape. But they’re curious, so…” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;So now they have a peptide guy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain responsible for motor movement. Now there's fresh evidence for how these crucial brain cells are being killed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(90)91341-D"&gt;previous studies in animal models&lt;/a&gt; showing that as these neurons die, the remaining ones work harder, researchers from the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease in the US used genetically modified mice to test the theory that intense bursts of overactivity could be causing the initial damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiments showed that when drugs were used to artificially stimulate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dopamine-doesnt-work-in-our-brains-quite-the-way-we-thought"&gt;dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of the test animals for several days, the cells gradually degenerated and then died – specifically in the region for motor control known as the substantia nigra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-hints-at-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;Parkinson's Link to Gut Bacteria Hints at an Unexpected, Simple Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An overarching question in the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="173785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; research field has been why the cells that are most vulnerable to the disease die," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/overworked-brain-cells-may-burn-out-parkinsons-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ken Nakamura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Answering that question could help us understand why the disease occurs and point toward new ways to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173788" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173788" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/NeuronScan.jpg" alt="Neuron scan" class="wp-image-173788 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/NeuronScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/NeuronScan-600x208.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173788" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied overactive dopamine neurons in mouse brains, finding changes in calcium production. (Rademacher et al., &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with neuron death in general, it's not clear if the loss of overworked cells could be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/damaged-dna-could-warn-of-parkinsons-long-before-symptoms"&gt;triggering Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, or if the neurons' exhaustion is more of a consequence of the disease. It may be a bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also undetermined why these cells go into overdrive in the first place. Different environmental and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt; could be involved, the researchers suggest, raising questions for further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a close analysis of the mice brains, the team found that the neurons that were running hot showed changes in calcium levels, and in the expression of genes related to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/unexpected-discovery-about-dopamine-may-help-explain-parkinsons"&gt;dopamine metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and calcium regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further examination of brain cells from people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-the-earliest-roots-of-parkinson-s-disease-in-the-brain"&gt;early-stage Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; showed similar patterns related to calcium regulation and dopamine production. It's as if some of the cells' healthy stress responses had been dialed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In response to chronic activation, we think the neurons may try to avoid excessive dopamine – which can be toxic – by decreasing the amount of dopamine they produce," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/overworked-brain-cells-may-burn-out-parkinsons-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Katerina Rademacher, from the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, the neurons die, eventually leading to insufficient dopamine levels in the brain areas that support movement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest there might be a vicious cycle at work, where overactive neurons die off and then the remaining neurons become more active to compensate. It's a little like lightbulbs becoming too bright and blowing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of reasons have been put forward to explain why dopamine-producing neurons die off in Parkinson's, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-parkinsons-protein-structure-and-malfunction-revealed-for-first-time"&gt;malfunctioning mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; (the energy sources inside cells) to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;harmful protein clumps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there's a new option to consider, which the researchers want to test further: and if this does indeed help explain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-brand-new-parkinsons-trigger-has-been-found-and-it-begins-far-earlier-than-thought"&gt;why the disease gets started&lt;/a&gt; in the first place or continues to accelerate, the next step is finding ways to block it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It raises the exciting possibility that adjusting the activity patterns of vulnerable neurons with drugs or deep brain stimulation could help protect them and slow disease progression," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/overworked-brain-cells-may-burn-out-parkinsons-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nakamura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98775.3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3uuc00123b7azxhalliw@published"&gt;My spouse and I are on a difficult journey through infertility struggles. We’ve had some pregnancy losses, and we’re currently pursuing treatment. During this time, we also became foster parents, with the goal of helping parents and children to reunify (privately, I felt that channeling my grief into helping other parents would be healing).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3uvr00133b7a2e3t3bbn@published"&gt;Our most recent foster case has transitioned to adoption. We love our soon-to-be son, though we had no idea he’d become legally ours when the case began. Suddenly, I’m very self-conscious about how this looks from the outside. I don’t personally believe that adoption is a solution for infertility, and our little boy is not a consolation prize. I find myself bristling at well-meaning comments from others (“You get to keep him!” being a common one) and I don’t want our toddler growing up thinking he was Plan B. How do I navigate the nuances of two traumatic experiences—our infertility, and our child’s removal from his first family—in social situations without promoting an unhealthy view of family-building?&lt;/p&gt;

Now the challenge is—as it so often is—dealing with others whose understanding is less nuanced, and who have the luxury of an offhand response.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v3e00173b7a0qnn8s00@published"&gt;One “solution” (which will be helpful only in the future; it does no good with all the people with whom you’ve already shared the full details) is to stop telling people about your difficult journey through infertility struggles and to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; describe your son’s foster-to-adoption story. Neither is it anyone’s business but your own. If there are people in your life—a sibling, a best friend, a parent—to whom you are accustomed to “telling everything,” then go ahead and tell them &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, including your reservations about adoption, your strong feelings about it not being a solution to infertility, and a confession of your anxiety about “how this looks.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v5200183b7a5nq47nyh@published"&gt;But since the cat is out of the bag with (most of?) the people in your life, I’d say you need to divide these well-wishers into two categories: those closest to you and everybody else. With Group 1, retroactively offer an accounting of everything you just told me. With Group 2, the appropriate response to their delighted congratulations (when offered while your son is still young enough not to understand, or when he isn’t present) is to say thanks, and move on to talking about something else. (And do not offer updates as they occur: Consider the discussion of both your efforts to become pregnant and your son’s adoption closed. When you do eventually become pregnant, and you want to share that news with the whole world, no matter what these people say—whether it’s, “OMG finally!” or even “You must be over the moon to be having ‘your own’”—stick to “Thanks.” There’s no percentage in correcting the assumptions of others, especially when the emotional cost to you is high.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="191" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v8b001a3b7a5e3bjkep@published"&gt;When it comes to your son, all you need to do to make sure he doesn’t feel like Plan B is to love and treasure him—I promise, if you do, he’ll know. And of course doing everything you can to support him through the traumatic loss of his first family (including recognizing that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a trauma—not by pointing this out to him and trying to process it with and for him, but by being available to him as he feels and processes it, and offering him resources to help him do so) will go a long way to ensure that he feels deeply loved and precious to you. In “social situations,” if anyone is thoughtless enough to say to &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, “Aren’t you a lucky boy?!” or, in his presence, to you, “Aren’t you lucky you got to keep him!” consider laughing, maybe responding with the ambiguous, “Luck has nothing to with it,” and then changing the subject (one of my most reliable go-to’s). Then, when you get home, ask him how the comment made him feel. And let him, for the zillionth time, know how very much you love him.&lt;/p&gt;

He lets them eat handfuls of candy and other things out of those self-serve bins. It’s not only unsanitary, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s stealing and setting a terrible example for them. Jack says he considers it “sampling.” I’m the main breadwinner in the family, and it’s my husband who is usually at home with the kids. It’s he who almost exclusively handles the shopping while I’m at work, which means I can’t be there to supervise what goes on. How can I put a stop to this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001q3b7areiyow5k@published"&gt;I’m with you: Letting the kids grab food out of the bins is a terrible idea. Along with what you’ve mentioned, it’s a lousy thing to do to everyone who buys food from that bin after your little germ-carriers have dipped their hands into it. (Your husband is lucky he hasn’t been kicked out of the store yet.) It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; petty theft—you might point out to your husband that “sampling” applies only to what’s offered for free by the store, not what’s taken from them without express permission—and allowing it indeed gives them the message that taking what isn’t theirs to take is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001r3b7a0epl8a4s@published"&gt;Try to say this in as non-accusatory a way as you can muster. “I know you don’t want to give them that message,” you might say (lovingly). “They’re too young to understand the subtle difference you understand between taking candy that’s not theirs from a store and taking it from friends, say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001s3b7acts307e3@published"&gt;You might also point out (still keeping your tone level) that if others are doing what the kids are doing, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are picking up whatever others have been putting down. I know you’ve told him that this practice is “unsanitary,” but I’m guessing that spelling it out in gross detail—“If anyone who has a cold has just blown his nose and then stuck his hand in the bulk gummy worms bin, that cold is definitely going to be passed along to the next poor chump who reaches in for a handful of worms and bits of mucus”—will be more effective. (As my creative writing students know, concrete details will always be more effective than a summary.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vw0001t3b7a5wj0iais@published"&gt;I do want to offer one tip for a healthy, long-lasting marriage. Even though you’re right about this business with the bulk bins, in general, it isn’t fair to expect your children’s father to be responsible for their care while you supervise it from a distance. In other words: You’re not the foreman; he’s not the worker. So don’t &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; him he can’t do this anymore; don’t issue orders and don’t make the rules and expect him to follow them. Talk things over with him. In situations where his judgment proves to be less than the best &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; (theft is wrong; sticking hands in food that others may have stuck their hands in is begging for health trouble; sticking hands in food that others will take home to eat is selfish and mean), have a thoughtful conversation that helps him see things in a way that inspires him to make a better choice. And if he’s doing something with the kids that you don’t care for but that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; objectively bad, maybe keep your opinion to yourself. Nobody likes to have all the responsibility but none of the authority.&lt;/p&gt;

We have two kids, “Sarah,” who is 8, and “Travis,” 11. We left them with my sister, “Olive,” as the wedding was adults-only. During the reception, we got a call from Olive saying that Travis had crashed her car into a neighbor’s parked car while trying to drive off with hers. She said Travis had gotten into her purse and taken her keys while she was in the bathroom. Thankfully, our son wasn’t injured, but he did cause thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to her car and the neighbor’s car he hit.&lt;/p&gt;

I would further have to assume that she didn’t take those warnings seriously, or she would either have refused your request that she babysit overnight, or locked her purse in a safe and hid all her valuable belongings.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb5aqc002c3b7amy6zk2nb@published"&gt;If so, shame on you for insisting that what happened is “her problem.” You should absolutely pay for the damages caused by your son. You should also get him help immediately, whether through a family therapist, individual counselor, or both (stealing her car was not a harmless, run-of-the-mill prank; you’re right that he could have been killed—and so might others have been if he’d made it off your sister and her neighbor’s street). You should recognize that what Travis did is a harbinger of even worse to come if there isn’t an intervention now. You should apologize profusely to your sister.&lt;/p&gt;

Something is very wrong when you reduce an incident such as this to “I’m not giving you a red cent!” and a level of hostility to your sister that rises to your self-righteous assertion that she’s lucky you’re not (yet?) planning to sue her. If your disdain for her long predates this harrowing event, why did you leave her in charge of your children while you went out of town for a wedding? (Unless it wasn’t so much that you were entrusting them to her, but rather that it was a punishment for her past misdeeds.)&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a rule, the stories in our "following up" series look back at previous articles from Goats and Soda. But when freelance journalist Ruchi Kumar pitched the idea of following up on media coverage of a heart transplant for a 12-year-old girl, whose heart had been weakened by illness, we were interested. Doctors drove through one of the most brutal Russian attacks on Kyiv to collect a heart donated by the mother of a 4-year-old who had died of brain injuries from an accident. Here's a look at that extraordinary night — and how the girl with the transplant is now faring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-87246-100"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About This Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're looking back at some of our favorite &lt;em&gt;Goats and Soda&lt;/em&gt; stories to see "whatever happened to ..."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;On the night of July 9, Dr. Borys Todurov, the director of the Kyiv Heart Institute, received a call from a colleague at the Ohmatdyt Hospital across the city. Earlier that evenings, a 4-year-old girl had died of brain injuries from an accident, and her parents had agreed to donate her organs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Todurov had a patient — Kira Skliarova, a 12-year-old girl from Luhansk region of Ukraine — who needed a new heart urgently. Childhood illnesses had severely weakened her own heart. "She was on the waiting list for a long time, and just one day before we implanted her with a mechanical heart, but she needed a transplant," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He had to risk his own life to complete the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The donor's body was located about 10 miles from the Heart Institute, which was on that evening under one of the heaviest Russian attacks since the start of the full-scale war in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There were Russian missiles and drones everywhere, the air raid alert was going off," he said. "But we had a chance to save a life so took it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Dg2zd1hia/" target="_blank"&gt;video made by Todurov&lt;/a&gt; shows their vehicle dodging explosions as Ukrainian air defenses fought off Russian drones. "On our way, we saw a lot of drones, and buildings that they targeted that were on fire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88469" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Kira, center, still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life." Kira is flanked by her mother, right, and the mother of her heart donor, left.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl with a broken heart &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's family was displaced during the Russian invasion of their region in 2014 and moved to Kyiv as internally displaced refugees. In 2019, the girl developed a severe case of pneumonia, which eventually led to inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with post-myocarditis condition, her mother Alyona Skliarova, told NPR over a phone call. For the next six years, Kira endured a rigorous drug treatment regime and was frequently in and out of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As her condition worsened, especially in the last six months, "her doctor told us, 'It's time to get her on a waiting list for a new heart,'" Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On July 8, her team of doctors decided the girl was facing imminent death and so operated to fit her with an artificial heart — an assistive device to help her body pump blood. "When I came to her [after the surgery], she was lying with that mechanism, with the whole thing on the outside, I could see the blood circulating. [It looked] like a suitcase, like the one we take with us when we go to the railway station," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I was so shocked, really shocked. That image was not for the faint-hearted people to see," she said. "I wondered, if there isn't a donor heart available, how long could one live with this suitcase device."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the attacks of July 9 began, Kira was in the ICU after her surgery. Her mother was in the hospital but had to go to a shelter because of the intense bombing. Her husband — Kira's dad — had died of COVID in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery under fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When news of the donor heart came, Todurov did not hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was a limited window of time to extract the organ and then transplant it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He and his crew — a scrub nurse, a surgeon and an anesthesiologist — drove to the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital amid the bombing and began the procedure, even as the ground beneath their feet shivered from the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"During the extraction, we could not only hear the noises of drones and missiles but also feel the vibrations of the explosion," he said. "We knew it was very, very dangerous, but once we had the heart, it would only be viable for a few hours outside the body, so we decided to transport it right away,"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Back at their own hospital, Todurov's team wasted no time to prep for the heart transplant — even as they felt the building shake from the explosions outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing intensity of attacks, they forged ahead. "Surgeries need to be conducted with precision; you need attention, focus, and we are doing this with explosions around us. We are working to save lives, and they are killing civilians around us," Todurov said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A chance at a new life"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a very serious attack that night, but the whole time, I was praying to all the gods, Kira, Kira, Kira," her mother recalled. "Somehow we survived the night, and when the air raid alarms ended, I went to see Kira." Her daughter no longer needed to be connected to the artificial heart contraption. "I felt a relief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our doctors — they are gods on earth. I am so grateful to them!"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first three days after the transplant were sensitive, her mother said, as her body adjusted to the new heart. "She lost some weight at first. Her organs didn't receive enough blood. and she was vomiting when she ate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After three days, Kira's body embraced her new heart and her health began to improve.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She has some issues with spasticity, where her muscle are stiffened, on the right side of her arm, leg and eye. But she is working with a rehabilitation therapist," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bittersweet moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's transplant has been a bittersweet moment for the mother of the donor — a 4-year old girl whose organs helped save two other lives that fateful night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mother of the donor visited Kira, said Aloyna Skliarova, "and listened to her daughter's heart beat in Kira's chest. On the one hand, that's a tragedy for [her]. On the other hand, it became a chance for life." She added with gratitude: "I respect her so much, and I'm so grateful for her decision. She gave my child a chance to live."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Mother and daughter are determined to make the best of this new lease at life. "I hope we will have more walks in parks, catch up on everything. There are a lot of things in Kyiv that we haven't yet seen, because we've spent these six years in hospitals or laying at home with the sickness," Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One dream is to visit the Carpathian Mountains. "I was there once and I want Kira to see this beauty, go for a walk, climb on [the mount] Khomyak," she said. "We are planning to live. Just to enjoy life, with this new heart. Only God knows what the future will be like, but yes, there is a will to live."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruchi Kumar is a journalist who reports on conflict, politics, development and culture in India and Afghanistan.

As a result, the problem often goes unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, including the signs you should bring up with your doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue and brain fog are frequently reported symptoms of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are often saddled with &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mom-mental-load_l_63f7a67ee4b0616708e04d9a" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="the mental load" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63f7a67ee4b0616708e04d9a" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;the mental load&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to caring for children, partners, parents and completing must-do tasks around the home. This is often associated with more fatigue and lower mood. And while that is certainly true, iron deficiency can play a role here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptom of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is fatigue, “but difficulty concentrating, or poor concentration, that sort of mental fog ... is well noted,” Shatzel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of iron deficiency also include impaired memory and mood-related complications, Fein added. &lt;a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/news/archive/202305/could-low-iron-be-making-your-mental-health-symptoms-worse" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/news/archive/202305/could-low-iron-be-making-your-mental-health-symptoms-worse" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that low iron can worsen &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/depression" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="depression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/depression" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, too. People may also have trouble catching their breath after exercise or going up stairs, according to Fein.

Blood is really your main store of iron,” said Shatzel, noting that it only takes a small amount of blood loss to spark the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body absorbs iron very slowly, and this is intentional “because if you do get excessive iron, that can be a health risk as well,” Shatzel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Probably about half of the women who have low iron have heavy periods that they don’t even realize a lot of the time,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also other causes of iron deficiency, including inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease, Fein noted. The problem can also be a sign of colon cancer, a gastric ulcer or even Celiac disease, according to Shatzel. These issues can happen in both men and women, but in men, the underlying cause of iron deficiency is &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="often more severe" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;often more severe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also been a rise in people getting gastric bypass weight loss surgery, “which causes iron deficiency on purpose by causing malabsorption of all nutrients,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s largely an issue among women with periods and bleeding disorders, Fein added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is common in pregnancy and can cause complications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is also common (and under-diagnosed) in pregnant people, according to both experts, which can be particularly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541841/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541841/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that iron deficiency can cause complications in pregnancy for both the mother and the baby, Shatzel noted. These include complications like preterm birth, low birth weight and &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/pregnancy" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="developmental delays" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;developmental delays&lt;/a&gt;. If moms are fatigued already from low iron, they’re less able to push, resulting in more C-sections, Fein said. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/7246-cesarean-birth-c-section" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="C-sections are more risky" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/7246-cesarean-birth-c-section" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;C-sections are more risky&lt;/a&gt; than vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And this is a public health problem that affects Black people disproportionately, because it turns out that half of [pregnant] Black people have iron deficiency, and a third of non-Black [pregnant] people have iron deficiency,” Fein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy and can lead to problems for both the mother and the baby if untreated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating low iron can improve quality of life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting iron levels to a healthy range not only brings your body back to where it should be, but can make life more enjoyable, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating iron deficiency is done in one of two ways, either by oral iron pills or IV therapy, Shatzel explained. The best remedy depends on the person. Your doctor can help you get the right treatment, but experts say IV iron often tends to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, in rare cases, blood transfusions are necessary, Shatzel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to treat the underlying cause of iron deficiency, which for many women is heavy periods, and can benefit from birth control and other medical interventions, according to Shatzel. But since low iron can also be caused by GI issues, GI workups are sometimes necessary to figure out the best treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest thing in the general population is the quality of life. It’s pretty clear people feel better when they’re not anemic and their iron is at a good level,” Shatzel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency can make folks tired, unfocused and anxious, which impedes day-to-day functioning, whether that’s spending time with loved ones, going to work or heading out for a hike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10608302/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="With normal iron levels, athletic performance will likely improve" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10608302/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;With normal iron levels, athletic performance will likely improve&lt;/a&gt;, making that run, dance class or HIIT class a little less tiring.

However, a new population-wide study being presented at this year's Annual Meeting of The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), Vienna (15-19 Sept) finds that half of adults without diabetes who start taking the weight-loss drug semaglutide in Denmark discontinue treatment within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This level of drop off is concerning because these medications aren't meant to be a temporary quick fix," explained lead author Professor Reimar W. Thomsen from the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. "For them to work effectively, they need to be taken long term. All of the beneficial effects on appetite control are lost if the medication is stopped."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally developed for diabetes, GLP-1RAs have shown promise in promoting weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing satiety signals from the gut to the brain. However, GLP-1RAs are expensive and can potentially widen health disparities as obesity disproportionally affects marginalised racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, weight regain is common once the medication is discontinued, indicating that people may need to remain on these drugs to keep off the pounds. However, there are growing concerns that many people may stop anti-obesity medications not long after starting them, but population-based data remain scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide more evidence, researchers used data from nationwide health registries to examine the likelihood of, and reasons for, discontinuation of semaglutide use for weight loss in all adults (aged 18 or older) without diabetes who initiated treatment between the drug's launch date in Denmark (December 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2022) and October 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 77,310 first time users of semaglutide for weight loss identified, over half (40,262; median age 50 years, 72% women) were no longer taking it after one year -- with 18%, 31% and 42% stopping treatment within 3, 6 and 9 months, respectively. So why do so many people discontinue the drug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that the most common factor influencing the likelihood of discontinuation was age, with younger users aged 18-29 years 48% more likely to stop treatment within the first year than those aged 45-59 years, after controlling for sex differences. Similarly, users living in low-income areas were 14% more likely to discontinue treatment within the first year than those living in high-income areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these factors highlight the likely impact of high costs of these medications (2000 Euros per year for the lowest dose of semaglutide as of June 2025), which is an important barrier to treatment for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher predisposition to adverse effects &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, people who had previously used gastrointestinal medications -- which may indicate they are more vulnerable to the common adverse gastrointestinal side-effects reported by GLP1-RA users, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea -- were 9% more likely to discontinue semaglutide within the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, people with a history of psychiatric medications were 12% more likely to discontinue treatment within the first year, while those living with cardiovascular disease or other chronic conditions were around 10% more likely to stop treatment early -- also suggesting a higher likelihood of experiencing adverse effects. "This is particularly concerning given that people with obesity-related comorbidities may reap the greatest benefit from treatment," said Professor Thomsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that men were 12% more likely to stop treatment within a year than women, which might reflect unsatisfactory weight loss given the better weight loss outcomes generally observed in women taking GLP-1RAs than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are new and shed light on the reasons for high rates of early discontinuation of semaglutide for weight loss in a real-world setting," said Professor Thomsen. "With over half of adults in Europe living with overweight or obesity, understanding who may benefit most from interventions that encourage adherence is essential to improving treatment use and subsequent health outcomes and quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the important findings, the authors acknowledge serval limitations of the study, including that anthropometric measures such as the exact BMI are not generally available in Danish health registries, and they could not assess individual-level income, insurance coverage, or out-of-pocket pay, which could partially affect the conclusions. They also note that milder side effects such as gastrointestinal complaints and other potential reasons for discontinuation cannot be captured fully in registries and were likely underestimated. Finally, the researchers did not have information on the amount of weight loss achieved after semaglutide initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though various factors are at play that govern cognitive decline, a healthy diet may help tip the scales in your favor. Both the Mediterranean diet and the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; (a diet similar to the Mediterranean diet, but more focused on foods and nutrients specifically known to support brain health) have been shown in randomized controlled trials to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow the rate of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that people who had the greatest adherence to a Mediterranean diet had a 72% decreased risk of developing dementia compared to those with the lowest adherence.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In that same study, the higher the score one had on a scale that measured adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the younger, or healthier, their brains seemed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive health, dementia and depression are all multifactorial, meaning that many variables —from genes to lifestyle habits, such as diet, exercise or smoking, as well as chronic conditions—are risk factors for these diseases that affect your brain. Though incorporating the principles of the Mediterranean diet in a way that fits your culture and preferences is essential, diet alone isn't the answer. What's more, other aspects of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8059162/dietitian-syrian-roots-mediterranean-diet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, such as strong social ties, rest and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-slow-aging-11793621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular movement&lt;/a&gt;, are also important for brain health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What foods should you eat for your noggin? There are so many possibilities in a Mediterranean diet—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, lean protein and healthy fats. And the healthy eating principles of the diet can be applied to any type of cuisine—you don't need to only eat foods and dishes from Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain and Greece to gain the health benefits. Here are a few brain-supporting foods to try to fit into your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;

Opt for healthy preparation methods, such as grilling, broiling and baking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant-based oils:&lt;/strong&gt; Oils such as olive oil, avocado oil and chia seed oil are packed with heart-healthy fats. Olive oil contains anti-inflammatory components that not only directly impact your brain but may also play a role in the health of your gut microbiome, which can also help protect your brain&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Chia seed oil contains plant-based omega-3 fatty acids to reduce overall inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green leafy vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether in a salad, stirred into soups or pasta dishes or as a sandwich filler, greens such as spinach, kale, lettuces and arugula are essential on the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits&lt;/strong&gt;: Fruits are eaten as part of sweet and savory dishes in the Mediterranean diet. Whether fresh, pureed, dried or frozen, they are enjoyed in abundance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pasta&lt;/strong&gt;: In all shapes and sizes, pasta is enjoyed in the Mediterranean diet. It is often used as a vessel to consume more vegetables, olive oil, herbs and spices.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new investigational treatment targets the root cause of a life-threatening liver condition connected to obesity and diabetes, offering hope for millions of patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/ucsd/"&gt;University of California, San Diego School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have developed an investigational drug that could provide a new treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This severe type of fatty liver disease is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes and can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;The Lancet&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;The Lancet&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is one of the oldest and most respected peer-reviewed medical journals, founded in 1823. It publishes research, reviews, and commentary on global health, clinical medicine, and public health policy. The journal is known for its influence on healthcare debates and global health equity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study reports that the drug, known as ION224, blocks a liver enzyme called DGAT2. This enzyme is essential for the liver’s process of producing and storing fat. Inhibiting it reduces both fat accumulation and inflammation, the two main contributors to liver damage in MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blocking fat accumulation and inflammation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study marks a pivotal advance in the fight against MASH,” said Rohit Loomba, MD, principal investigator of the study and chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “By blocking DGAT2, we’re interrupting the disease process at its root cause, stopping fat accumulation and inflammation right in the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_494373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494373" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-494373" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-777x971.jpg" alt="Rohit Loomba" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-777x971.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-400x500.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-768x960.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-150x188.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-450x563.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1-1200x1500.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rohit-Loomba-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-494373" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rohit Loomba, MD, is chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at UC San Diego Health.

&lt;p&gt;A Phase IIb clinical trial was carried out at multiple centers across the United States, enrolling 160 adults diagnosed with MASH and showing early to moderate fibrosis. Over the course of a year, participants were given monthly injections of either varying doses of the investigational drug or a placebo. Results revealed that at the highest dose, 60% of patients experienced significant improvements in liver health compared to those who received the placebo. Importantly, these benefits were observed regardless of changes in body weight, indicating that the treatment could be combined effectively with other therapies. The study also reported no serious side effects attributable to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A widespread and silent condition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MASH, formally known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), affects people with metabolic conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is often called a “silent” disease because it can progress for years without symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people have some form of fatty liver disease in the U.S., and as many as 1 in 4 adults worldwide may be affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If left untreated, MASH can progress to liver failure and often may require a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Looking ahead to future therapies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first drug of its kind to show real biological impact in MASH,” Loomba said. “If these findings are confirmed in Phase III trials, we may finally be able to offer patients a targeted therapy that halts and potentially reverses liver damage before it progresses to life-threatening stages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loomba, who is also director of the metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) research center at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at UC San Diego Health, adds that for patients and families affected by this serious condition, these results bring new hope for better care and outcomes. He emphasizes that early intervention and targeted therapies may also help reduce the burden on health care systems by preventing costly and complex liver disease down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps include a larger clinical trial to move closer to making this treatment widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll see it in gyms, yoga studios, and even in your local grocery store’s “healthy beverages” aisle. Marketed as a natural sports drink packed with electrolytes, it’s often called a “miracle hydrator.” But here’s the real deal: while coconut water does have some legit health perks, it’s not perfect—and drinking too much can actually cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the benefits and risks of coconut water in plain English so you can decide whether it deserves a spot in your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Water Hack?

Natural hydration with electrolytes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered, is coconut water good for hydration? — the answer is yes. Coconut water naturally contains electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. That’s why it’s popular among athletes, runners, and anyone sweating it out in hot weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think coconut water is a healthy beverage option?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534364/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;shows coconut water works just as well as sports drinks for keeping you hydrated.

Supports heart health &amp;amp; blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, coconut water is packed with potassium, which helps balance sodium levels in your body. For people with slightly high blood pressure, this can be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some small studies link coconut water to better circulation, lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and a boost in HDL (“good”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: if your potassium levels are already normal, you probably won’t see a huge heart-health benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. May help with blood sugar &amp;amp; antioxidants&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024170417" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;show coconut water may improve blood sugar control and reduce diabetes-related damage. It also contains antioxidants that help fight free radicals, which can cause cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, human research is still limited. If you have diabetes, coconut water isn’t a magic cure, but choosing unsweetened coconut water over soda or juice is a healthier option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Kidney stone prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9262403/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggests coconut water can help reduce the risk of kidney stones by increasing the excretion of potassium, citrate, and chloride. Basically, it may help your body flush out minerals that can build up into stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have kidney disease, a moderate amount of coconut water may be a kidney-friendly choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Digestive &amp;amp; immune support&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water has small amounts of enzymes that may support digestion. Plus, it contains vitamin C and lauric acid, which may help with immunity. The effects are subtle, but every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The risks of coconut water&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the not-so-fun part. Coconut water isn’t risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Too much potassium can be dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s so high in potassium, drinking too much coconut water can cause hyperkalemia (excess potassium in the blood). This can lead to irregular heartbeats and, in severe cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease or those taking potassium-sparing meds should be especially careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Digestive issues &amp;amp; allergies&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water acts like a mild laxative for some people, which can lead to diarrhea or too much urination if overdone. It can also trigger allergic reactions in those sensitive to coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugar &amp;amp; calories add up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s natural, coconut water has sugar—around 6–8 grams per cup. For someone with diabetes or watching calories, this can sneak up on you. Always go for unsweetened coconut water instead of flavored or added-sugar versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contamination risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re traveling and drinking straight from a questionable coconut, there’s a small chance of bacterial or fungal contamination. Rare cases of food poisoning have been reported. Safer bet: stick to pasteurized coconut water from trusted brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should drink coconut water?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water is great for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy adults looking for a refreshing, low-calorie drink&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Athletes or anyone sweating a lot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People needing a mild potassium boost&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may not be ideal for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with kidney problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those on potassium-altering medications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone with diabetes (unless consumed in moderation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much coconut water is safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, 1 cup (about 8 oz) a few times a week is perfectly fine. Just don’t chug liters of it daily and expect miracle results. Think of it as a supplement to your hydration, not a replacement for good old-fashioned water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is coconut water good for you? Yes, when enjoyed in moderation. It’s refreshing, naturally hydrating, and comes with some real health benefits like supporting hydration, heart health, and possibly kidney stone prevention. But it’s not a super-drink, and too much can actually be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy coconut water as part of a balanced diet, but don’t rely on it to fix health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 03:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPekh6SjJ3dmQtSmdtR1VGVWVFbFhWUlJfZ3hxVkU4N1dRSUY3VnhHVXRldWxGbGc3RE1BZExpd2RFMlBpUTdmWGF0MWJMVDg5MER6NGQ1VS1UXzM3OWtObzZIUUZuUGozU1dQMVJNT1M1Z25aLWZpTTVldVh3ZlZjLXpiQTFEWU5sdkNER2JhYTREbkw5cG1mWmhqbTFvSEZtYWZyN0RDVU5DWmNvN3Jwak1JYm5aalp1bU9KTlF5eTRZUUNueVFhREIwVWx0RUllMWJIOW03RjRrRmpPbWJBUHoxWC1lMHZvb0dQczlxbmowTy1PWmZtU9IB_gFBVV95cUxQaHFneFJkYkVNMXM0aWxKb1UxOGZMYzVWNkNsTm15ZHotMUJPUlpTSVdqOFdQaXZGUGN6WWUyNGdvZjlNYzR5cThXMVV4cmdhdjdxQUcyQ1R6QlhrY3JwMzkteGdTN3hKYmRaWFA2MWhtT1VndGo2V1dpam93UmJGd2otZEZ6d0d5S0ZyX2gyQTk2eFFRR3JWZUwtZmdJdnNyVnpaVFB3X0xDVDlPd1RXUVBTb2pWSF9OcDJ3ajNpUkJtUmxGcHE0cUxRbEpmYnRFeEhiS0wwc01qRUVGdjBOX3BMX0dJVTQ0UDJmZlBfTktYSzJ5SnZRX3VidDJ5QQ</guid></item><item><title>维生素D可能有助于减缓衰老，研究结果- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/vitamin-d-may-help-slow-aging-study-finds/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

A new study suggests vitamin D may protect the delicate chromosome caps linked to aging, potentially lowering the risk of age-related diseases. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clinical trial suggests vitamin D may slow cellular aging by preserving telomeres. Researchers urge caution on dosing and emphasize lifestyle as the most reliable path to healthy aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supplements may help safeguard the protective caps on our chromosomes that influence the pace of aging, raising hopes that the “sunshine vitamin” could support healthier longevity, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40409468/"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers reported that taking 2,000 IU (international units, a standard vitamin measurement) of vitamin D each day helped preserve telomeres, the small structures at the ends of chromosomes that act like the plastic tips of shoelaces, shielding &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; from damage during cell division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our 46 chromosomes ends with a telomere, which gradually shortens every time a cell divides. Once &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0099-1"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt; become critically short, cells lose the ability to divide and ultimately die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortened telomeres have been associated with several major age-related conditions, including &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/26/9/1381/71345/The-Association-of-Telomere-Length-in-Peripheral"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4227.abstract"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40520-021-01944-6"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Factors such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28704792/"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;, chronic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8920518/#:%7E:text=Stress%20induces%20secretion%20of%20glucocorticoids,to%20short%20and%20dysfunctional%20telomeres."&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07076-5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; appear to accelerate this process, while &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammatory processes&lt;/a&gt; in the body also contribute to telomere loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beyond strong bones&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is widely recognized for its role in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4781354/"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in helping the body absorb calcium. Adequate intake is especially important for children, adolescents, and individuals with darker skin or limited sun exposure to ensure proper &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph56/chapter/What-is-this-guideline-about"&gt;bone growth and maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vitamin D also powers our immune system. A review of evidence found that vitamin D supplements can cut respiratory infections, especially in people who are deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early research even suggests it might help prevent autoimmune diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27644953/"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27510600/"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997212001310"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, though more trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammation damages telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D’s anti-inflammatory effects could explain its protective role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing vitamin D in a clinical study&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this recent study, from Augusta University in the US, the researchers followed 1,031 people with an average age of 65 for five years, measuring their telomeres at the start, after two years, and after four years. Half took 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily, while the other half received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that telomeres were preserved by 140 base pairs in the vitamin D group, compared with a placebo. To put this in context, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19666704/"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that telomeres naturally shorten by about 460 base pairs over a decade, suggesting vitamin D’s protective effect could be genuinely meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first promising finding. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986705/"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have reported similar benefits, while the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316700/#:%7E:text=3.1.-,Consumption%20of%20Specific%20Foods,28,33,34%5D."&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; – rich in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131600/"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt; – has also been linked to longer telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The catch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some important points to note. Some researchers warn that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6715353/"&gt;extremely long telomeres&lt;/a&gt; might actually increase &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2300503"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting there’s a sweet spot we don’t yet understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also no agreement on the right dose. The Augusta researchers used 2,000 IU daily – much higher than the current recommended intake of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019735/"&gt;600 IU&lt;/a&gt; for under-70s and 800 IU for older adults. Yet other research suggests just &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5949172/"&gt;400 IU&lt;/a&gt; might help prevent colds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-021-00593-z"&gt;optimal dose&lt;/a&gt; probably depends on individual factors, including existing vitamin D levels, overall nutrition, and how the vitamin interacts with other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are exciting, it’s too early to start popping high-dose vitamin D in the hope of slowing aging. The strongest evidence for healthy aging still points to the basics: a balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, not smoking, and managing stress, all of which naturally support telomere health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re deficient in vitamin D or at risk of poor bone health, supplements remain a sensible choice backed by decades of research. As scientists continue unravelling the mysteries of aging, vitamin D’s role in keeping our cellular clocks ticking may prove to be just one piece of a much larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="428" data-end="710"&gt;Stress has a way of sneaking into everything. It shows up in tense shoulders, restless sleep, and the constant feeling that you’re running on empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="428" data-end="710"&gt;The busier life gets, the more your nervous system carries the weight—and most of us don’t realize how badly we need ways to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="712" data-end="1009"&gt;Hobbies might sound like an afterthought when you’re stressed, but psychology says they’re actually one of the best tools for calming the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="712" data-end="1009"&gt;They give your mind a break from the endless loop of work, notifications, and worries, while signaling to your nervous system that it’s safe to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;Here are nine hobbies backed by research that can help you turn down the volume on stress and bring your system back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1145" data-end="1162"&gt;1. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1164" data-end="1376"&gt;I still remember planting my first herb pot on the tiny balcony of my first apartment. Watching those fragile green shoots push through the soil felt strangely healing, like I was rooting myself alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1681"&gt;Psychologists often point to the restorative effects of nature. A study in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2019/04/09/20-minute-nature-pill-relieves-stress"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1453" data-end="1478"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that gardening reduces cortisol (the stress hormone) and improves mood even after short periods of time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1681"&gt;For stressed people, this is more than a pastime—it’s a form of natural therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1683" data-end="1902"&gt;Even if you don’t have a backyard, tending to herbs on a windowsill or a couple of houseplants can bring a sense of calm. The act of watering, pruning, and watching something grow gives you a gentle, grounding anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1904" data-end="1922"&gt;2. Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1924" data-end="2160"&gt;Have you ever felt like your mind is running twenty tabs at once? Writing them down can feel like finally closing a few. Journaling gives stressed people a private outlet to process the constant churn without judgment or interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2162" data-end="2440"&gt;Research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374669665_Expressive_Writing_Moderates_the_Relation_Between_Intrusive_Thoughts_and_Depressive_Symptoms#:~:text=Expressive%20writing%20moderates%20the%20relation%20between%20intrusive,or%20by%20desensitizing%20people%20to%20such%20thoughts."&gt;&lt;em data-start="2188" data-end="2224"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that expressive writing helps regulate emotions and reduce intrusive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2162" data-end="2440"&gt;By turning nebulous worries into concrete words, your nervous system relaxes—you’re literally organizing your feelings on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2442" data-end="2656"&gt;Start simple: jot down three thoughts before bed, or keep a running log of moments that made you feel grateful, overwhelmed, or inspired. Over time, those pages become a roadmap for understanding yourself better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2658" data-end="2670"&gt;3. Yoga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2672" data-end="2897"&gt;Step onto a mat, and you’re stepping into one of the most proven practices for nervous system regulation. Yoga combines mindful breathing with slow, deliberate movement, giving stressed bodies a safe way to release tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3154"&gt;A meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245214"&gt;&lt;em data-start="2918" data-end="2928"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that yoga reduces anxiety and stress by modulating the parasympathetic nervous system—the system responsible for rest and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3154"&gt;For someone whose nervous system is constantly running hot, that’s game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3156" data-end="3392"&gt;You don’t need a fancy studio or expensive gear. A quiet corner, a mat, and a short online video can be enough. Even five minutes of stretching with intentional breaths can shift your body out of fight-or-flight and back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3394" data-end="3424"&gt;4. Knitting or crocheting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3426" data-end="3672"&gt;When my grandmother taught me to crochet, I thought I’d never get the hang of it. Then one evening I realized hours had passed and my brain had been blissfully quiet the entire time. Without me noticing it, the repetitive motions had lulled me into a meditative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3674" data-end="4033"&gt;That’s the beauty of fiber arts—they occupy your hands just enough to calm the mind without overstimulating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3674" data-end="4033"&gt;Psychologists describe this as “&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-flow-2794768"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;,” a term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, which refers to the mental state of being fully immersed and losing track of time. Flow states have been shown to reduce stress and increase feelings of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4035" data-end="4186"&gt;Knitting, crocheting, or even weaving are hobbies that let stressed people settle into rhythm and quiet focus, soothing frayed nerves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4188" data-end="4213"&gt;5. Walking in nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4215" data-end="4388"&gt;There’s a reason a long walk in the park can feel like medicine. For stressed people, being outside in natural spaces is like hitting a reset button on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4390" data-end="4747"&gt;Psychological research backs this up: a study in &lt;a href="https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s12199-009-0086-9#:~:text=The%20results%20show%20that%20forest,a%20strategy%20for%20preventive%20medicine."&gt;&lt;em data-start="4439" data-end="4485"&gt;Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that spending time in forests (often called “forest bathing”) lowers heart rate and reduces stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4390" data-end="4747"&gt;If you're constantly weighed down by daily tension, a wooded trail or even a tree-lined neighborhood walk can bring down the static in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4749" data-end="4903"&gt;You don’t need a destination. Just moving your body and letting your senses tune in to birdsong, leaves rustling, or the smell of soil can restore calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4905" data-end="4934"&gt;6. Painting or sketching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4936" data-end="5137"&gt;A blank page and a handful of colors can do more for stress than most people realize. Creative expression allows you to externalize what you’re feeling, transforming pressure into something tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;Art therapy is well-studied in psychology. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5836011/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even simple drawing or painting can reduce cortisol and create a state of relaxation. You don’t have to be an artist—the act matters more than the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;I once tried urban sketching during a particularly stressful season, carrying a small notebook and pen on my lunch breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;Sitting on a park bench, sketching buildings and strangers passing by, I realized how quickly my focus shifted from my own worries to the lines and shapes in front of me. By the time I put my pen away, my thoughts felt calmer and more ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5402" data-end="5549"&gt;Let yourself doodle, paint abstract swirls, or sketch without rules. It’s about giving your emotions a place to land where words aren’t required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5551" data-end="5587"&gt;7. Playing a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5589" data-end="5785"&gt;Have you ever noticed how playing music can pull you out of your head? Strumming a guitar, tapping piano keys, or even trying a hand drum shifts your focus from overthinking to rhythm and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5787" data-end="6100"&gt;Psychologists note that music-making engages multiple parts of the brain, stimulating relaxation and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5787" data-end="6100"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, musical activities lower stress and promote emotional resilience. For people under constant stress, it’s not just fun—it’s therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6102" data-end="6292"&gt;Pick an instrument that feels approachable, even if it’s something simple like a kalimba or ukulele. The act of playing—however imperfect—creates a soothing dialogue between you and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6294" data-end="6334"&gt;8. Cooking simple, nourishing meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6336" data-end="6589"&gt;There’s a comfort in chopping vegetables, stirring a simmering pot, and tasting as flavors come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6336" data-end="6589"&gt;In fact, this is one of my go-to hobbies whenever life feels overwhelming. Cooking can be both grounding and sensory-friendly, offering a safe space to engage touch, smell, and taste in calming ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6591" data-end="6788"&gt;Cooking also creates predictability—something we crave when life feels out of control. The sequence of steps and the satisfaction of a finished dish can bring the nervous system a sense of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6790" data-end="6936"&gt;It doesn’t need to be elaborate. Even preparing a pot of soup or baking bread can feel like a ritual that centers your body and eases your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6938" data-end="6971"&gt;9. Meditation and breathwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6973" data-end="7172"&gt;Living with stress means your awareness is constantly heightened, and that can be exhausting. Meditation and breathwork give that awareness a direction, turning it from overwhelming to restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7174" data-end="7462"&gt;A large body of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3004979/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; supports this. Mindfulness meditation increases gray matter in brain regions linked to emotional regulation. In other words, it helps train your nervous system to respond more calmly to life’s stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7464" data-end="7694"&gt;Even a few minutes of slow, deliberate breathing—inhale for four, hold for four, exhale for four—can shift your system out of fight-or-flight. Over time, this practice becomes a tool you can rely on whenever life feels too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7696" data-end="7715"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7717" data-end="7896"&gt;Stress might be part of life, but it doesn’t have to run the show. These hobbies are more than just ways to pass time—they’re tools your nervous system can lean on to find rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7898" data-end="8206"&gt;You don’t need to tackle all nine. Start with one or two that feel doable and notice how your body responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7898" data-end="8206"&gt;Whether it’s gardening, journaling, or cooking something simple, the point is the same: giving yourself regular, reliable ways to calm down is one of the most powerful antidotes to constant stress.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

I’d never heard of thyroid cancer. It was such a shock.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar cases are becoming increasingly common. Thyroid cancer – which affects the small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck – has soared over the past two decades. In the UK, diagnoses have risen by 62 per cent in just ten years and are expected to climb by nearly three-quarters by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid makes and releases hormones that control many important functions, including metabolism – how the body uses energy – as well as heart rate, temperature and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is one of five cancers rising in younger adults, according to the American Cancer Society, alongside throat, prostate, kidney and colon. And cases of thyroid cancer are nearly four times higher in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colombian-American actress Sofia Vergara, British actress Marisa Abela, and Love Island star Demi Jones have all spoken publicly in recent years about their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actress Sofia Vergara underwent treatment for thyroid cancer when she was 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each of them developed the disease before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the surge in thyroid cancer cases may partly be explained by improvements in medical technology, with more tumours detected that might otherwise have gone unnoticed and never caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-739e2530-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7,000 children developed thyroid cancer in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some doctors point to a more controversial reason: that medical technology itself is actually fuelling the rise. They warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer. Children are most at risk, as exposure at a young age is more likely to cause problems decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds alarming, yet in June a major study reached a similarly stark conclusion. Researchers found that about 5 per cent of all new cancers in the US could be linked to CT scans – a toll comparable to those caused by alcohol. About 4,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, most of them aged between 70 and 74. But cases have almost tripled over the past three decades, with young women the fastest-growing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wider rise in cancers among younger adults has drawn considerable attention in recent months, with experts pointing to ultra-processed foods, obesity and even certain strains of gut bacteria as possible drivers. However, when it comes to thyroid cancer, specialists say the explanation is less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no doubt of an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the past 25 years,’ said Professor Fausto Palazzo, an endocrine surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital in west London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In large part, we believe it’s related to the fact that we’re simply detecting more disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, he added, that doesn’t mean more cancers aren’t developing than before. ‘It just makes it more difficult to interpret.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key question, he said, is whether there is something that is making thyroid cancer more common in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The only two things we know that increase the chance of thyroid cancer are genetic history and radiation exposure,’ he continued. ‘And while there has been some theorising that an increase in radiation exposure in the environment in recent decades could be contributing to cases, it’s very difficult to prove.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts are attempting to do just this. Dr Riccardo Vigneri, emeritus professor of endocrinology at the University of Catania in Italy, has spent decades studying thyroid cancer. In a 2020 paper he analysed 18 years of data from the Californian death registry. If the surge were due only to overdetection, the records would show a rise mainly in small, slow-growing tumours – the kind that may not cause harm. Instead, they showed a marked increase in larger, more advanced cancers, along with a rise in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That, he argued, was clear evidence the trend could not be explained by scanning alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All evidence indicates the causes of worldwide increase in thyroid cancers are recent, environmental and multiple,’ he wrote in the journal Cancers. The ‘most likely contributing factor’, his team concluded, was increased exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, the most severe exposures followed nuclear events – from the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Chernobyl – where children nearby developed thyroid tumours at high rates. But today, the greatest source of man-made radiation comes from medicine –diagnostic tests such as X-rays and CT scans, which use high-energy beams to produce detailed images of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-93c95050-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid gland is responsible for producing the hormones that control the body’s temperature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark analysis by researchers from several US universities showed that, between 1980 and 2006, the average radiation dose received by Americans had doubled – with CT scans responsible for more than half of that exposure. Around a third of all CTs were directed at the head and neck. Children face the greatest risk, as their developing tissues are especially sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study of more than 11 million Australians found that children who underwent CT scans had a 40 per cent higher risk of thyroid cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, endocrinologists at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago warned that the surge in medical radiation was running in parallel with rising thyroid cancer rates, and urged doctors to limit the use of CT scans in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts stress that the scans are often lifesaving – they’re vital for detecting tumours, internal bleeding or serious infections – and that the overall risk to any individual patient remains very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest thyroid cancer may also be linked to radon gas – a natural by-product of uranium in the ground that seeps into homes. Already known to cause lung cancer, a 2020 study from the University of Guam found signs it could raise thyroid cancer risk too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But many experts say it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In medicine, we’re stuck with epidemiology – the study of disease in a population – to guide us in deciding whether or not a certain factor is responsible,’ said Prof Palazzo. ‘And without this type of large-scale research, we can’t say anything with certainty.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research is looking beyond radiation, including the role of iodine – a trace mineral essential for producing thyroid hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iodine is found in fish, dairy products and eggs, yet a 2010 study of more than 700 UK schoolgirls showed over two-thirds were deficient. Historically, about half of Britain’s iodine intake came from milk – but levels have fallen with the decline of free school milk and the rise of vegan and dairy-free diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regions where iodine deficiency is common also tend to report higher rates of thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the thyroid needs iodine to make hormones, explained Dr Jahangir Ahmed, consultant ENT surgeon at OneWelbeck in London. ‘If you’re not getting enough iodine, the thyroid gland can become bigger, thinking it will help it make more,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When this happens, the growth driver might also cause mutations in the thyroid cells, which is the precursor to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The same thing happens in pregnancy – the baby demands more iodine, which can make the mother deficient.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has pointed to hormone-disrupting chemicals and air pollution as possible drivers. A 2022 study by the University of Beijing found thyroid cancer rates were higher in areas with poor air quality. Scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Shenzhen, China, also reported links between the disease and endocrine-disrupting compounds found in everyday products such as flame-retardants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2020 study, researchers from Tulane University in the US and Egypt’s Suez Canal University concluded there was ‘strong evidence’ that certain man-made chemicals can impair thyroid function, raising the risk of future tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for why women seem to be more affected than men, the answer is similarly speculative. ‘It’s most likely hormone related,’ said Dr Ahmed, ‘as we know after menopause that the rates of men and women getting thyroid cancer start to come together.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women may also be at higher risk because of their increased likelihood of autoimmune conditions, where the body begins to attack the thyroid gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed added: ‘This causes chronic inflammation, and can make the thyroid more prone to cell mutation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer generally has an excellent prognosis. While some forms are more aggressive, the two most common types – papillary and follicular – are usually slow-growing and highly treatable. ‘If you catch it in a reasonable time, more than 90 per cent of patients can be cured,’ said Dr Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include a lump in the throat or neck, a hoarse voice lasting more than three weeks, breathing problems or difficulty swallowing. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment often involves surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid, sometimes followed by radioactive iodine therapy to destroy any remaining thyroid cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For very small tumours, less than a centimetre across, doctors may recommend monitoring rather than operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I reassure the majority of my patients that they’ve got time,’ said Dr Ahmed. ‘With a few exceptions, thyroid cancers have an excellent prognosis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;I was diagnosed aged 31... and there were no warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was during a rare attempt to relax that special needs teacher Jess Cain, right, now 35, first discovered the lump in her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was having a massage and the masseuse immediately told me something didn’t feel right,’ said Jess, pictured right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I felt it too and agreed. It was like a marble under the skin, beneath my ear, that became more prominent when I turned my head.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned, Jess booked an appointment with her GP, who reassured the then 31-year-old it was most likely a swollen lymph node from an oncoming cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week later she still felt fine but the lump hadn’t gone. After insisting on being seen again, Jess was referred for a scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months later, an ultrasound revealed a suspicious mass in her neck. And just five days before Christmas, she was told it was cancerous. A biopsy and surgery in January confirmed it was thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was so confused,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had had no symptoms and, when I was diagnosed, I didn’t know anyone with thyroid cancer at all.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then Jess has had her thyroid removed, undergone radioactive iodine therapy, and endured further surgery to shave down part of her neck. Now she wants others to understand how destabilising the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People refer to it as “the good cancer” because it’s easily treated, but it’s already been two years with it for me and I’ve already had a resurgence within three months of getting the all-clear,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no such thing as a good cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:41:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQOGw2NUw4Wnk3UWlYWWhPV3FtcTdUZ2JFc05DRXlXSkJHb2Vsd3BlVlFyVjZWbmNmVWNUTF91TDFkY19zSTB5QUVZZTRhcVFIYVhQRUVRZTl6dHNJbmgwVVRRRUdmaGF3djBEaGJjSnNfcS1ETlVhR2tfVkhackNNZzJwQWRuckNacExsOEZqODhVVmkxY1ZMcmZUQk1RTElGZFBQZjQyUQ</guid></item><item><title>常见的测试医生担心甲状腺癌激增的背后-每日邮报</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 31 and in good health, Jess Cain was horrified to discover a small lump in her neck, which she had thought little of, was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-006a86e0-90bf-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The special needs teacher felt well, with no symptoms, and went to the doctor only after a massage therapist spotted the growth and urged her to get it checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Expecting reassurance, she was instead diagnosed with thyroid cancer and told she would need surgery almost immediately, followed by months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My surgeon told me I’d likely had the tumour for almost a decade,’ recalled Jess. ‘But I hadn’t had any pain or any other symptoms.

And cases of thyroid cancer are nearly four times higher in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colombian-American actress Sofia Vergara, British actress Marisa Abela, and Love Island star Demi Jones have all spoken publicly in recent years about their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actress Sofia Vergara underwent treatment for thyroid cancer when she was 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each of them developed the disease before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the surge in thyroid cancer cases may partly be explained by improvements in medical technology, with more tumours detected that might otherwise have gone unnoticed and never caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-739e2530-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7,000 children developed thyroid cancer in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some doctors point to a more controversial reason: that medical technology itself is actually fuelling the rise. They warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer. Children are most at risk, as exposure at a young age is more likely to cause problems decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds alarming, yet in June a major study reached a similarly stark conclusion. Researchers found that about 5 per cent of all new cancers in the US could be linked to CT scans – a toll comparable to those caused by alcohol. About 4,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, most of them aged between 70 and 74. But cases have almost tripled over the past three decades, with young women the fastest-growing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wider rise in cancers among younger adults has drawn considerable attention in recent months, with experts pointing to ultra-processed foods, obesity and even certain strains of gut bacteria as possible drivers. However, when it comes to thyroid cancer, specialists say the explanation is less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no doubt of an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the past 25 years,’ said Professor Fausto Palazzo, an endocrine surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital in west London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In large part, we believe it’s related to the fact that we’re simply detecting more disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, he added, that doesn’t mean more cancers aren’t developing than before. ‘It just makes it more difficult to interpret.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key question, he said, is whether there is something that is making thyroid cancer more common in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The only two things we know that increase the chance of thyroid cancer are genetic history and radiation exposure,’ he continued. ‘And while there has been some theorising that an increase in radiation exposure in the environment in recent decades could be contributing to cases, it’s very difficult to prove.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts are attempting to do just this. Dr Riccardo Vigneri, emeritus professor of endocrinology at the University of Catania in Italy, has spent decades studying thyroid cancer. In a 2020 paper he analysed 18 years of data from the Californian death registry. If the surge were due only to overdetection, the records would show a rise mainly in small, slow-growing tumours – the kind that may not cause harm. Instead, they showed a marked increase in larger, more advanced cancers, along with a rise in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That, he argued, was clear evidence the trend could not be explained by scanning alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All evidence indicates the causes of worldwide increase in thyroid cancers are recent, environmental and multiple,’ he wrote in the journal Cancers. The ‘most likely contributing factor’, his team concluded, was increased exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, the most severe exposures followed nuclear events – from the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Chernobyl – where children nearby developed thyroid tumours at high rates. But today, the greatest source of man-made radiation comes from medicine –diagnostic tests such as X-rays and CT scans, which use high-energy beams to produce detailed images of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-93c95050-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid gland is responsible for producing the hormones that control the body’s temperature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark analysis by researchers from several US universities showed that, between 1980 and 2006, the average radiation dose received by Americans had doubled – with CT scans responsible for more than half of that exposure. Around a third of all CTs were directed at the head and neck. Children face the greatest risk, as their developing tissues are especially sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study of more than 11 million Australians found that children who underwent CT scans had a 40 per cent higher risk of thyroid cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, endocrinologists at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago warned that the surge in medical radiation was running in parallel with rising thyroid cancer rates, and urged doctors to limit the use of CT scans in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts stress that the scans are often lifesaving – they’re vital for detecting tumours, internal bleeding or serious infections – and that the overall risk to any individual patient remains very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest thyroid cancer may also be linked to radon gas – a natural by-product of uranium in the ground that seeps into homes. Already known to cause lung cancer, a 2020 study from the University of Guam found signs it could raise thyroid cancer risk too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But many experts say it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In medicine, we’re stuck with epidemiology – the study of disease in a population – to guide us in deciding whether or not a certain factor is responsible,’ said Prof Palazzo. ‘And without this type of large-scale research, we can’t say anything with certainty.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research is looking beyond radiation, including the role of iodine – a trace mineral essential for producing thyroid hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iodine is found in fish, dairy products and eggs, yet a 2010 study of more than 700 UK schoolgirls showed over two-thirds were deficient. Historically, about half of Britain’s iodine intake came from milk – but levels have fallen with the decline of free school milk and the rise of vegan and dairy-free diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regions where iodine deficiency is common also tend to report higher rates of thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the thyroid needs iodine to make hormones, explained Dr Jahangir Ahmed, consultant ENT surgeon at OneWelbeck in London. ‘If you’re not getting enough iodine, the thyroid gland can become bigger, thinking it will help it make more,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When this happens, the growth driver might also cause mutations in the thyroid cells, which is the precursor to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The same thing happens in pregnancy – the baby demands more iodine, which can make the mother deficient.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has pointed to hormone-disrupting chemicals and air pollution as possible drivers. A 2022 study by the University of Beijing found thyroid cancer rates were higher in areas with poor air quality. Scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Shenzhen, China, also reported links between the disease and endocrine-disrupting compounds found in everyday products such as flame-retardants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2020 study, researchers from Tulane University in the US and Egypt’s Suez Canal University concluded there was ‘strong evidence’ that certain man-made chemicals can impair thyroid function, raising the risk of future tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for why women seem to be more affected than men, the answer is similarly speculative. ‘It’s most likely hormone related,’ said Dr Ahmed, ‘as we know after menopause that the rates of men and women getting thyroid cancer start to come together.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women may also be at higher risk because of their increased likelihood of autoimmune conditions, where the body begins to attack the thyroid gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed added: ‘This causes chronic inflammation, and can make the thyroid more prone to cell mutation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer generally has an excellent prognosis. While some forms are more aggressive, the two most common types – papillary and follicular – are usually slow-growing and highly treatable. ‘If you catch it in a reasonable time, more than 90 per cent of patients can be cured,’ said Dr Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include a lump in the throat or neck, a hoarse voice lasting more than three weeks, breathing problems or difficulty swallowing. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment often involves surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid, sometimes followed by radioactive iodine therapy to destroy any remaining thyroid cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For very small tumours, less than a centimetre across, doctors may recommend monitoring rather than operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I reassure the majority of my patients that they’ve got time,’ said Dr Ahmed. ‘With a few exceptions, thyroid cancers have an excellent prognosis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;I was diagnosed aged 31... and there were no warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was during a rare attempt to relax that special needs teacher Jess Cain, right, now 35, first discovered the lump in her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was having a massage and the masseuse immediately told me something didn’t feel right,’ said Jess, pictured right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I felt it too and agreed. It was like a marble under the skin, beneath my ear, that became more prominent when I turned my head.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned, Jess booked an appointment with her GP, who reassured the then 31-year-old it was most likely a swollen lymph node from an oncoming cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week later she still felt fine but the lump hadn’t gone. After insisting on being seen again, Jess was referred for a scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months later, an ultrasound revealed a suspicious mass in her neck. And just five days before Christmas, she was told it was cancerous. A biopsy and surgery in January confirmed it was thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was so confused,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had had no symptoms and, when I was diagnosed, I didn’t know anyone with thyroid cancer at all.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then Jess has had her thyroid removed, undergone radioactive iodine therapy, and endured further surgery to shave down part of her neck. Now she wants others to understand how destabilising the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People refer to it as “the good cancer” because it’s easily treated, but it’s already been two years with it for me and I’ve already had a resurgence within three months of getting the all-clear,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no such thing as a good cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:41:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNM21IVVBUUmVadFZNeWFWOXBYaEdreFA1NHhVT2FHaWxMSW91V21vZUFFR19zNGdrUV9RSGJfSFk1SmhRUEVvaHRHbkdQenBJT0tWOGZUNDBLNURuTWxTbGFDODFDZWlydEE2SDVPVGJnc1h2SVo5MHRRQnFSSTFUZGVUQzkxd0dKbXRXUktkc25heHljU1d1Y3VaNk92dkdNWER4RFdB</guid></item><item><title>挖掘声称RFK Jr.和白宫“埋葬”研究将酒精使用与癌症联系起来- Snopes.com</title><link>https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/09/13/rfk-jr-alcohol-cancer-study-buried/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-content"&gt;

&lt;ul class="snopes_key_points"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2022, both the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; and Congress commissioned reports on the health effects of alcohol, to be provided to the committee that produces the United States government's dietary guidelines every five years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2025, days before President Donald Trump took office, a &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;draft of the two studies&lt;/a&gt; was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; for public comment. The health department's study found that alcohol was very risky to health, while the study commissioned by Congress found that a small amount of alcohol might be slightly beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-"&gt;Current dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend that people who do not drink alcohol should not "&lt;span&gt;start drinking for any reason." The guidelines recommend men limit themselves to two drinks a day, and women limit themselves to one drink a day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In June 2025, Reuters published a story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that said four anonymous sources claimed the committee responsible for producing the 2025-30 dietary guidelines planned to drop the recommended limits on alcohol consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;In September 2025, Vox published a story&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Trump's administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had "buried" the health department's study. This is somewhat true — researchers were informed their final report would not be published in any form — and somewhat false — the draft version of the report was available to read online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 4, 2025, Vox &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; that claimed U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the White House had "buried" a major study on alcohol and cancer. The story detailed the convoluted path of the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, initially commissioned in 2022 by the nation's health department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vox's story claimed the study (technically a meta-analysis, or a &lt;comment-start name="ea59068b10dacd768b952be487e7fb6dd:202ec"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;review&lt;comment-end name="ea59068b10dacd768b952be487e7fb6dd:202ec"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt; of existing research), which found an "increased mortality for seven types of cancer" at all levels of alcohol usage, had been hidden from public knowledge by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kennedy, his health secretary. (Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet"&gt;has been classified as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; since as early as 1987, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2834641?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamaoncol.2025.1146"&gt;but that isn't well-known&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/g5SkH"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/uXcx4"&gt;on social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7pb96"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, and Snopes readers emailed and searched the site looking for more information about whether the administration had prevented the study's publication. &lt;comment-start name="e48f8c8843f6b2dbdd2fbdd1dcb8984af:f98ae"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;We contacted the health agency, the White House and scientists involved in the study for comment. &lt;comment-end name="e48f8c8843f6b2dbdd2fbdd1dcb8984af:f98ae"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;We had not heard back from the White House at time of publication; &lt;comment-start name="e03ca3ed2501608d598d0e3037931eb66:e1a3a"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;the health department provided basic information on the study but did not respond to specific questions.&lt;comment-end name="e03ca3ed2501608d598d0e3037931eb66:e1a3a"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study &lt;i&gt;was,&lt;/i&gt; in fact, publicly available. In the days before Trump returned to office in late January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;a draft version was published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; to allow for public comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the study's authors sending the government their final version in March 2025, according to Vox's reporting, the final report had not been published, as of this writing. Three of the authors told Vox they learned the administration was&lt;span&gt; not going to publish the study in any form, but did not say who gave them that information. (In an email to Snopes, one author, Tim Naimi, declined to elaborate but said he was "confident" that information was correct).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are further complications to the story, too. The study was supposed to be included in a presentation to Congress on underage drinking, but the &lt;comment-start name="eb2fadb8bf69497da4c546477291b5a39:e6a95"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;researchers told Vox their report would not be &lt;comment-end name="eb2fadb8bf69497da4c546477291b5a39:e6a95"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;included. The study also was supposed to inform the United States' dietary guidelines for the next five years, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;Reuters reported in June&lt;/a&gt; that the government was planning to drop the recommended daily limit for alcohol from its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the complicated situation, we have elected to forgo a rating. Here's what we know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every five years, the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments collaborate to release the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a list of recommended eating and drinking habits aimed to keep citizens healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prepare the guidelines, the government asks a committee of scientists and doctors to produce a comprehensive advisory report on the state of the average American health and diet and any recommended changes to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, before 2020, the dietary guidelines recommended that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day, and women to one drink per day. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf"&gt;the committee's report recommended&lt;/a&gt; lowering the daily limit for alcohol consumption to one drink per day across the board. The report is only advisory, and the 2020 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-"&gt;kept the previous limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/MSstG"&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The two alcohol studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the health department commissioned a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;comment-start name="ef7b298c583a84cf04e5f859295f61728:a6038"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;comment-end name="ef7b298c583a84cf04e5f859295f61728:a6038"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;, conducted by a group of outside scientists. (This is the one the Vox headline claimed has been "buried").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Congress commissioned the National Academies to write a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;The Vox story&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Congress commissioned the alcohol health study &lt;comment-start name="e5a86aed2cf17e0274a771750f06e830f:ae2ea"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;because of lobbying from the alcohol industry, which alleged the independent scientists were anti-alcohol. &lt;comment-end name="e5a86aed2cf17e0274a771750f06e830f:ae2ea"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;One co-author on the health department's study told Vox that lawmakers claimed she had a conflict of interest because she "&lt;span&gt;accurately described scientific research in the media." Another author, Naimi, told Snopes he was "very proud" of his record, and that criticism from politicians and industry "comes with &lt;comment-start name="e53f28fb8272f5a98713025358f90c321:46bf3"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;the subject matter" of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;comment-end name="e53f28fb8272f5a98713025358f90c321:46bf3"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both studies were commissioned with the idea that they would be provided to the committee in charge of producing 2025-30 dietary guidelines. Vox also reported that the health department's study was supposed to factor into an annual report to Congress on underage drinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the studies were published in January 2025, in the days before Trump took office, the differences in their findings were clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health department's study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming alcohol was very risky for health, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the National Academies' study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming a small amount of alcohol might even be beneficial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the health department told Snopes via email that "&lt;span&gt;a final version was subsequently provided … &lt;comment-start name="e03b6905823d821e77b053302ff64fc9a:b26ff"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;to HHS/OASH&lt;comment-end name="e03b6905823d821e77b053302ff64fc9a:b26ff"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt; [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health] and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for consideration as the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which remains ongoing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snopes also asked the health department who was involved in the reported decision to not publish the final version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, and whether the dietary guidelines committee was considering dropping its guidance on a daily limit for alcohol consumption, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;as reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. We did not receive a response to those questions. &lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. and the White House had "buried" a major study on alcohol and cancer. The story detailed the convoluted path of the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alcohol Intake and Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, initially commissioned in 2022 by the nation's health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vox's story claimed the study (technically a meta-analysis, or a review of existing research), which found an "increased mortality for seven types of cancer" at all levels of alcohol usage, had been hidden from public knowledge by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kennedy, his health secretary. (Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has been classified as a carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;has been classified as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; since as early as 1987, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2834641?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamaoncol.2025.1146" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:but that isn't well-known;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;but that isn't well-known&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The article &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/g5SkH" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/uXcx4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:on social;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;on social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7pb96" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, and Snopes readers emailed and searched the site looking for more information about whether the administration had prevented the study's publication. We contacted the health agency, the White House and scientists involved in the study for comment. We had not heard back from the White House at time of publication; the health department provided basic information on the study but did not respond to specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study &lt;i&gt;was,&lt;/i&gt; in fact, publicly available. In the days before Trump returned to office in late January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a draft version was published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a draft version was published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Federal Register;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; to allow for public comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, despite the study's authors sending the government their final version in March 2025, according to Vox's reporting, the final report had not been published, as of this writing. Three of the authors told Vox they learned the administration was&lt;span&gt; not going to publish the study in any form, but did not say who gave them that information. (In an email to Snopes, one author, Tim Naimi, declined to elaborate but said he was "confident" that information was correct).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are further complications to the story, too. The study was supposed to be included in a presentation to Congress on underage drinking, but the researchers told Vox their report would not be included. The study also was supposed to inform the United States' dietary guidelines for the next five years, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reuters reported in June;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Reuters reported in June&lt;/a&gt; that the government was planning to drop the recommended daily limit for alcohol from its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given the complicated situation, we have elected to forgo a rating. Here's what we know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every five years, the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments collaborate to release the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a list of recommended eating and drinking habits aimed to keep citizens healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In order to prepare the guidelines, the government asks a committee of scientists and doctors to produce a comprehensive advisory report on the state of the average American health and diet and any recommended changes to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, before 2020, the dietary guidelines recommended that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day, and women to one drink per day. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the committee's report recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the committee's report recommended&lt;/a&gt; lowering the daily limit for alcohol consumption to one drink per day across the board. The report is only advisory, and the 2020 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kept the previous limit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;kept the previous limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/MSstG" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:archived;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The two alcohol studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2022, the health department commissioned a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alcohol Intake and Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by a group of outside scientists. (This is the one the Vox headline claimed has been "buried").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Later that year, Congress commissioned the National Academies to write a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Vox story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Vox story&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Congress commissioned the alcohol health study because of lobbying from the alcohol industry, which alleged the independent scientists were anti-alcohol. One co-author on the health department's study told Vox that lawmakers claimed she had a conflict of interest because she "&lt;span&gt;accurately described scientific research in the media." Another author, Naimi, told Snopes he was "very proud" of his record, and that criticism from politicians and industry "comes with the subject matter" of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both studies were commissioned with the idea that they would be provided to the committee in charge of producing 2025-30 dietary guidelines. Vox also reported that the health department's study was supposed to factor into an annual report to Congress on underage drinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the studies were published in January 2025, in the days before Trump took office, the differences in their findings were clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The health department's study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health department's study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming alcohol was very risky for health, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Academies' study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;the National Academies' study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming a small amount of alcohol might even be beneficial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for the health department told Snopes via email that "&lt;span&gt;a final version was subsequently provided … to HHS/OASH [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health] and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for consideration as the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which remains ongoing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Snopes also asked the health department who was involved in the reported decision to not publish the final version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, and whether the dietary guidelines committee was considering dropping its guidance on a daily limit for alcohol consumption, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as reported by Reuters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;as reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.

							&lt;p&gt;Have you been told you should get a check-up and clean every six months? Perhaps your dental clinic’s or health insurance policy’s default is to ask you to book these services twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at whether this advice is based on evidence or opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you need regular check-ups and cleans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regular oral health checkup usually involves a dentist or oral health practitioner (dental therapist, dental hygienist, oral health therapist) examining the teeth, gums and surrounding structures of the mouth. This helps identify signs of tooth decay or gum disease, in addition to any changes to soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most instances, you will have your teeth professionally cleaned in the same visit, with a “scale and clean”, along with dental x-rays to identify issues that aren’t visible to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste and cleaning between teeth (for example, by flossing) at home can’t reach all the surfaces of the teeth and gums. Professional cleaning is needed to remove the remaining plaque and tartar (calcified dental plaque) and the bacteria they contain, which cause tooth decay and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the research evidence say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all research is equal: some types of evidence are more reliable than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cochrane systematic reviews are the most trusted because they use rigorous methods to collect and evaluate all available research evidence on a specific health question. These reviews judge how strong the evidence is and whether the studies might be affected by bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adult oral health check-ups, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004346.pub5"&gt;2020 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found strong evidence that six-monthly check-ups did not offer any additional benefit in preventing tooth decay or gum bleeding, compared to those whose frequency of check-ups was risk-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-based means dental practitioners set the time between dental check-ups depending on the individual’s risk of dental disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review, which looked at data over four years, also found there wasn’t enough good research to know how different dental check-up schedules affected children’s and teenagers’ teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of six-monthly professional cleaning, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004625.pub5"&gt;2018 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found strong evidence that having regular professional cleaning made little or no difference to signs of gum disease (gingivitis or bleeding gums), or to levels plaque deposits, compared to adults with less regular professional cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a small reduction in tartar levels, however it’s unclear if this is meaningful to consumers and dental practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who had six- or 12-monthly cleans reported their teeth felt cleaner than those who didn’t have scheduled cleans, but there was no difference between groups in reports of quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these reviews, six-monthly visits and cleans don’t seem to consistently lead to better oral health for adults compared to check-ups and cleans based on individual risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So can you forgo six-monthly visits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular professional dental check-ups are important throughout life, starting from the eruption of the first tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everyone has different oral health needs and risk levels which should be reflected in the frequency of their check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who are at high risk of oral disease do need to see a dental practitioner more regularly: every six months or even more often – such as every three months – to treat severe gum disease or tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with good oral health might only need to visit a dental practitioner every year or two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others still may be willing to pay for six-monthly check-ups and cleans for peace of mind, despite their lower oral health risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can I keep my teeth and gums healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain your oral health by brushing twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste. The evidence shows children and adults who brush less than twice daily are at high risk of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning between your teeth can also help reduce gum problems and dental plaque – more than brushing alone. You can use traditional dental floss or a flossing tool. Interdental brushes, which have a tiny bristled head that fits between teeth, can also be more effective than flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who lack manual dexterity and for children, water flossers can be an effective alternative to traditional flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, avoiding sugars added to foods and drinks, as well as the sugars naturally found in honey, syrups and fruit juices, helps protect teeth from tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIDALGO COUNTY, Texas (&lt;a href="http://valleycentral.com" data-type="link" data-id="valleycentral.com"&gt;ValleyCentral&lt;/a&gt;) — The Hidalgo County Health and Human Services has issued a warning following the recent outbreak of the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by the Hidalgo County Health and Human Services, over 60 cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease have been reported in four schools in Hidalgo County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidalgo County Health Authority Dr. Ivan Melendez informs the public that the disease primarily affects children but can spread to adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="btah1kyr" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melendez explains that the symptoms include fever, chills, a scratchy throat, nausea, and blisters that typically appear on the hands, feet, and mouth by the third day after being infected with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="btah1kyr" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The most infectious moment is during the first three days, when most people don’t know they even have it, because it’s spread through mucus, droplets, coughing, not washing hands and any bodily fluids,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts added that there is no cure for this virus, but doctors will provide symptomatic care by providing medications such as Tylenol and Motrin. Additionally, they will recommend patients to eat easy-to-chew foods such as macaroni and mashed potatoes, as the blisters can cause pain while eating. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Melendez advised that children can go back to school once they have gone a full day without a fever and their blisters are drying out. &lt;/p&gt;
