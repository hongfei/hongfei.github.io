But given her history of breast cancer, treating these &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hormone-therapy-estrogen-hot-flashes-fda-5b1f29a73553c142f67b1f88b6656428"&gt;menopausal symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/menopause-hormones-warning-fda-drugs-pills-women-f26a8208fd3f5174ec96d61140439561"&gt;hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wasn’t an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For two years, I tried to kind of power through,” said the 58-year-old physician assistant from Jacksonville, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors say women like Gajarawala don’t need to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though many women take &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/menopause-blood-pressure-hormones-estrogen-hypertension-994deaa7a320ba02d2b34be4018684bf"&gt;hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; medications to ease menopause symptoms, recently announced label changes may encourage even more to start. But others choose not to use these medications that circulate throughout the body. And doctors advise some to avoid them because they have medical problems such as severe liver disease or a history of heart attack, stroke, blood clots or a type of breast cancer that grows in response to hormones such as estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;For those people, there are lifestyle changes, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/menopause-drug-hot-flashes-fda-approval-d790530fcd7c63ef0dd7fb9f57001f25"&gt;medications without hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other strategies that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key here is that there’s something for everybody,” said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, medical director at the Menopause Society. “There’s always a solution. We have lots of other options available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle changes&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Boosting physical activity can make a difference. While exercise hasn’t been shown to alleviate menopausal symptoms directly, it can help to shed pounds, which is associated with reductions in hot flashes and night sweats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors suggest a mix of aerobic exercise, such as running or walking, and strength training, which slows the loss of bone density.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Along with exercise, doctors advise watching what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging science shows that a “plant-forward diet,” rich in produce and soy and low in oil, may help with managing hot flashes in particular, said Faubion of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health. Experts aren’t sure why this is true, but some suggest it may be because it also helps with weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Another key, doctors said, is to avoid things in the diet that may trigger hot flashes, like caffeine or alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well and exercising also help with other midlife health issues, like rising heart and diabetes risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During menopause, the body’s production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone declines greatly. The drop in estrogen levels can lead to higher blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important that we focus on maintaining cardiovascular health” such as stopping smoking, getting enough sleep and watching stress levels, Faubion said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prescription drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond lifestyle changes, some nonhormonal prescription medicines have been shown to ease menopausal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can help with hot flashes and mood issues. Recent data suggest that a drug for an overactive bladder called oxybutynin may reduce hot flashes while also treating frequent urination that’s common during menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And doctors pointed to a new drug on the market – Veozah, a brand name for fezolinetant — which works in the area of the brain that controls body temperature and blocks a source of hot flashes and night sweats. Another nonhormonal drug called elinzanetant — marketed as Lynkuet — was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It works similarly, except it blocks two molecules in the nervous system instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;One downside of such medications? Possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veozah’s label includes a federally required warning about the risk of a rare but serious liver injury. Lynkuet’s possible side effects include difficulty staying awake, fatigue and others. Some antidepressants can cause weight gain, although generally in doses higher than those used for menopause symptoms. And oxybutynin can cause dry mouth and, in some people, a condition in which they can’t completely empty the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no medication out there that’s entirely free of risk,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Other nonhormonal options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-the-counter products can also treat some menopausal symptoms. Lubricants available at drugstores can help women struggling with vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors, has been shown to help women cope with hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like it’s going to make you not have a hot flash,” Faubion said. “But it makes them less significant for you and less burdensome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manson said there’s “moderate evidence” that clinical hypnosis might also help, with some studies showing reductions in the frequency and severity of hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That seems a promising option,” she said. “But more research is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that women don’t have to simply “get through” menopause, said Dr. Juliana Kling, a women’s health expert at Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in Arizona. “I would implore women to have that conversation ... about what treatment might be beneficial for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gajarawala did that. She now skips red wine, walks at least 10,000 steps a day, practices tai chi and takes an extended-release antidepressant to address her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a significant improvement,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;Endurance athlete Kevin Humphrey was used to discomfort. He regularly participated in ultramarathons and other intense events. Swimming, biking and running dozens of miles at a time was standard for him. His two young sons also kept him active even when he wasn't training. But in January 2024, a persistent back pain kept bothering him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain "just would not go away," Humphrey said. He couldn't sleep on his back. At the same time, he started coughing. He was diagnosed with pneumonia, but his symptoms lingered even after treatment. A chest CT scan found "something going on" in his left lung. A biopsy of the organ came back inconclusive, Humphrey said, but he kept pushing for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I knew something was off. It just didn't feel right," Humphrey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey traveled from Michigan to Chicago to seek a second opinion at Northwestern Medicine in May 2024. A bronchoscopy found shocking results: There was a tumor in his lung that was crushing the left side of his windpipe, causing the coughing and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was really in disbelief," said Humphrey, who had never smoked and had no family history of lung cancer. "It wasn't even on my radar as a possibility. It wasn't even an option in my mind."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;"A very concerning and dire situation" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey was diagnosed with Stage IV non-small cell adenocarcinoma, joining the growing number of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/why-do-non-smoking-asian-women-have-high-rates-of-lung-cancer-a-ucsf-study-hopes-to-find-out/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;young, non-smoking patients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed with lung cancer. The rise may be driven by &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/radon-odorless-colorless-gas-lung-cancer-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or lifestyle factors, Dr. Jonathan Villena-Vargas, a thoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lung-cancer-diagnosis-in-non-smoker/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Villena-Vargas, who did not treat Humphrey, said there is no definitive reason for the increase. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further tests found that the cancer had spread beyond Humphrey's lung and had likely been growing for at least a year, Humphrey said. The disease typically has a 37% 5-year survival rate at that point, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6203-non-small-cell-lung-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey's tumor was "pretty advanced" and too large for surgery at first, said Dr. Daniel Dammrich, the Northwestern Medicine oncologist who treated him. But doctors were able to identify a "driver mutation" that was encouraging the cancer's growth. These mutations are more common in young, non-smoking patients, Villena-Vargas said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the mutation "really opened the door for some of our more nuanced, targeted therapies," Dammrich said, and "turned a very concerning and dire situation into a much more optimistic one."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dammrich and Humphrey agreed on an aggressive plan that would combine &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immunotherapy-cancer-mmrd-tumor-memorial-sloan-kettering-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;targeted immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with chemotherapy, in the hopes that the medications would shrink the tumor enough for surgery. Humphrey began immunotherapy immediately, then had chemotherapy in summer 2024. By August, the cancer was operable.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;"The biggest question mark"   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the cancer meant taking out about half of Humphrey's left lung. The athlete wasn't sure what that would mean for his passion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You just had no idea. Can you run again, can you bike, can you do all these endurance sports that I've loved doing?" Humphrey said. "That was the biggest question mark going into surgery." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unknowns, he focused on the future. Michigan's Ironman 70.3 race — which included a 1-mile swim, 56.1-mile bike ride and a 13.2 mile run — was scheduled to take place a year and a day after his surgery. Humphrey decided to sign up, despite his fears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Humphrey had surgery in mid-September. The operation removed most of the cancer, Dammrich said. Recovery was its own battle. Broken ribs and a "pretty big" incision made it difficult for Humphrey to do simple tasks like get out of bed or walk more than a few steps. Running was out of the question for months. But he kept putting one foot in front of the other until his strength and endurance began to slowly return. Even on the hardest days, the upcoming race kept him motivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a great mental thing to put on the calendar and train for," Humphrey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Across the finish line" &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 14, Humphrey was one of over 1,600 athletes who took part in the Ironman. He finished in just under five and a half hours, coming in &lt;a href="https://www.ironman.com/races/im703-michigan/results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;411th place&lt;/a&gt;. The race was exhausting and emotional, Humphrey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're replaying everything that's happened over the past year and the whirlwind it's been," Humphrey said. "For me, when I got to the point of knowing 'I'm going to finish this race' and thinking about my young boys, my wife, the family and the community and support system we've had throughout the whole year, and how grateful I am to not only be here but to continue to do these types of races and events. I certainly did not think that was going to be the case when I received the diagnosis in May of '24." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Humphrey's medical situation is also positive. He had a complete response to the treatment, and there is currently no evidence of disease in his body, Dammrich said. Regular CT scans and blood tests watch for any new tumor growth. Humphrey remains on immunotherapy with few side effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 12, less than a month after the Ironman, Humphrey ran the Chicago marathon for the sixth time. Over &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/53000-runners-2025-bank-of-america-chicago-marathon/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;53,000 runners participated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the race.

It was "40 or 45 minutes slower" than when he ran the same race in 2023, Humphrey said, but he was proud to have finished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My goal was just to get across the finish line, and that's what we did," Humphrey said. "I was just grateful for the ability to be out there and to run and be doing the things that I've loved doing for such a long time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1700732" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2017 Danish registry analysis&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10030023/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was published online Oct. 30 in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2840506" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/30/fact-checking-viral-claims-that-who-just-listed-the-contraceptive-pill-as-a-carcinogen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;can easily&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.debatemag.com/single-post/omg-the-pill-causes-cancer-here-s-what-tiktok-isn-t-telling-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;be taken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/05/social-media-misinformation-is-scaring-women-about-birth-control/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;out of context&lt;/a&gt; online and be reduced to a single alarming number.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2840506" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-survivor-earlier-screening-younger-women-face-rising-cases/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year — about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors Åsa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Fey — interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods — said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. "I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways," she said. "It's really frustrating … especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel — found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea — but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo‑Provera.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to interpret the findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer," said Lina S. Mørch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. Mørch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The doctor-patient conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable)," White wrote in an email. "Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, "For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired," referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. "It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data," they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeping the risk in perspective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. Mørch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's "values and preferences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White said it's important to see the big picture. "The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception—so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that an unprocessed diet contains about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet contains less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" target="_self"&gt;400 to 420mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of foods. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in sports and exercise medicine, said that magnesium can be found in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a supplement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084641/" target="_self"&gt;body can't absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" target="_self"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins, such as meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, notes that individuals taking medications that block B12 absorption, such as omeprazole or metformin, may also require a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" target="_self"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are recommended to take 1,200mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" target="_self"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often referred to as the "sunshine vitamin" because it is typically absorbed through the skin by simply being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/are-you-getting-enough-sun-heres-what-to-know-about-vitamin-d-supplements/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, making it a crucial nutrient for maintaining bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" target="_self"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." target="_self"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/what-to-know-multivitamins-memory-brain-health-age/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, as the Cleveland Clinic points out, the body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22isn%27t%20able%20to%20produce%20enough%20omega-3s%20on%20its%20own%22}" target="_self"&gt;is unable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" target="_self"&gt; to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/should-take-omega-3-supplements-benefits-drawbacks/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or the supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." target="_self"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts, but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" target="_self"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/how-weightlifting-benefits-you-during-the-aging-process/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other healthy habits, obtaining the right minerals and vitamins can improve your overall health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in your diet each day. Consult your doctor before taking any supplements to determine how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many factors that can lead to this, one of the more common reasons is because when you get older your body has a slower metabolism and less stomach acid, meaning absorbing nutrients is harder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things you may experience if you're not getting enough of the vitamins listed here include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle cramps or weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry and brittle hair and nails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more symptoms you could experience as a result of vitamin deficiency and any concerns should be brought up with your doctor before taking any supplements or changing your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNUmxLWFJ2dl93aU9yVHE4b0NkZzBZU2pva0hYWnM2Vnp5ZTBGZE9tczFsZmtONGtodzR4cTRwY1BCWVkyT3Z0bWVIR2wyYnU4RjJ0Qmw0S05pYWhyVzZ0UndEb1YyRnlwZVM5RzJhZTdfOUVvbkxGNFltekxmSnZaMlVCVzc0QU1LZ1JGU1ZHZFJ1cUtfT1FjWElDNWlwa0xpcU1iYUZPc09EZnFXc1FkSmVadDNXUQ</guid></item><item><title>携带侵入性疾病的蚊子已蔓延到落基山脉- WIRED</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/a-disease-carrying-mosquito-has-landed-in-the-rocky-mountains-where-it-historically-couldnt-survive/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;This story originally&lt;/span&gt; appeared on &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10112025/colorado-invasive-dengue-fever-mosquito/"&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/a&gt; and is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.climatedesk.org/"&gt;Climate Desk&lt;/a&gt; collaboration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It can carry life-threatening diseases. It’s difficult to find and hard to kill. And it’s obsessed with human blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Aedes aegypti is a species of mosquito that people like Tim Moore, district manager of a mosquito control district on the Western Slope of Colorado, really don’t want to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Boy, they are locked into humans,” Moore said. “That’s their blood meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This mosquito species is native to tropical and subtropical climates, but as climate change pushes up temperatures and warps precipitation patterns, the Aedes aegypti—which can spread Zika, dengue, chikungunya and other potentially deadly viruses—is on the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s popping up all over the Mountain West, where conditions have historically been far too harsh for it to survive.

In 2019, the local mosquito control district spotted one wayward Aedes aegypti in a trap. It was odd, but the mosquitoes had already been found in Moab, Utah, about 100 miles to the southwest. Moore, the district manager, figured they’d caught a hitchhiker and that the harsh Colorado climate would quickly eliminate the species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I concluded it was a one-off, and we don’t have to worry too much about this,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ byeLF caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption standard" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE fGraOh caption__text"&gt;Tim Moore, district manager of Grand River Mosquito Control District, explains that managing a new invasive species of mosquito in Grand Junction has required the district to increase spending on new mosquito traps and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso gxwcqg caption__credit"&gt;Photograph: Isabella Escobedo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPWm1BNENNU3Z2MFc1akpYc1VOOVVyYUdEY051VXQyTkE2QXNDeXUwY1QxN0JINnBkOTNuRXREQlNXNGpxb3IzTm9aY2N4cDB3NGQzazNscll0VjZURVFJM2dBNEl6b2x2T0tYZVNaVEJxNFdxaHlUNnNOZTFCQWttMWluVWQ3TkdNVEx6MTNuWXEtcFVaSE1CRHJUMGJBSVNFcTdhMjNzVmJHNzZVTEFiTGFDSWhLNHhHelE2TzlieVdBaS1nV25V</guid></item><item><title>为什么全世界的甲状腺癌病例都在增加？ - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251114-why-are-thyroid-cancer-cases-increasing-across-the-world</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What's more, as thyroid cancers have increasingly been diagnosed at earlier stages, and treatment outcomes have improved, Vigneri says you would expect the number of people dying from thyroid cancer to fall.

The researchers found that both the number of people diagnosed, and the mortality rate increased over the time period. The increase was irrespective of tumour size and stage of the cancer, suggesting that there must be something else at play rather than simply improved diagnosis of extremely small tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In 2017, Kitahara and her team also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2613728" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;examined the medical records&lt;/a&gt; of over 77,000 thyroid cancer patients diagnosed between 1974-2013. The results showed that, while most of the increase in cases was driven by small papillary tumours localised to the thyroid gland, there was also an increase in metastatic papillary cancers that had spread to other parts of the body. While deaths from thyroid cancer are rare, the study also showed these were increasing at a rate of 1.1% per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This suggested that there could be something else that could be driving the increase in these more aggressive tumours," says Kitahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPT2tQWjFnb1BYc21zYWlSd3dCQk1tUG5PTXRHQzBOLXJWWjh4SjdrS2JhUlM3Y0F6c2RZelB3a1FSbmFMallKZlpUNDdrcHRhVlpvTGZjbks5S0czMzJQMGJPbzhLaWdaS0g0X3NJa2R2N0FtYVM0aDY4Q25KYTV2U3BuSldYbGdlWk10VWswLW9zcmxGTjhOQllOY1VBMEhUWEE</guid></item><item><title>不健康的肠道如何使您的更年期症状恶化-如何改变这种状况- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/nutrition/how-an-unhealthy-gut-could-be-making-your-menopause-symptoms-worse-and-what-to-do-to-change-that</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

Good integrity means a strong ‘wall’ with no gaps and this protects the body against infections and illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During menopause, women also produce fewer short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). “These are chemical messengers that feed gut cells, keep the gut lining strong, and impact the immune system and metabolism,” says Macciochi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-CPw4NM7AkNkL67e8N2tdjn" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-CPw4NM7AkNkL67e8N2tdjn slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A drop in SCFAs can lead to inflammation and negative impacts on digestion, bowel regularity and nutrient absorption. It can also increase the risk of weight gain. Ultimately, this can have knock-on effects to common experiences of menopause, including mood, stress levels and sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what you eat can contribute to better gut health, so if you’re going through, or approaching, the menopause, it pays to give your microbiome a fighting chance by including these four types of food in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-what-to-eat-to-improve-gut-health-during-menopause" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-to-eat-to-improve-gut-health-during-menopause"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What to eat to improve gut health during menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7026d531-0d82-4371-8759-f6c3b321fadd" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="high-fiber-vegetables-and-wholegrains-3"&gt;High-fiber vegetables and wholegrains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="da04dfe1-2260-4912-b09d-d184c66cc8a2"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber in broccoli feeds beneficial microbes in your gut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / Tod Novak)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="6c711375-6daa-4c0d-a73f-a46afd89c201"&gt;“Fiber such as broccoli, lentils and oats acts as a prebiotic, meaning it feeds beneficial gut microbes,” says Macciochi. “When these microbes ferment fiber during the digestive process, they produce SCFAs that strengthen the gut lining, support immunity and help regulate blood sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-e28a6f60-fb92-4d2a-a5fc-b61a3c5d070f" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="polyphenol-rich-foods-3"&gt;Polyphenol-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="5b58e6ed-659b-415e-844a-57c3fde937e9"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / Nitas)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="64eeb3a6-6f7b-4474-a7fb-a706e5f34e2b"&gt;Blueberries, dark-skinned grapes, green tea, coffee, pomegranate and extra virgin olive oil are all rich in polyphenols.

It is best to use them only when needed and at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: older age, dehydration, existing kidney disease, heart failure, or using other drugs that affect kidney perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Use the lowest effective dose, for the shortest duration possible, and talk to a doctor if you need NSAIDs frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aminoglycoside antibiotics&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics (like gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) used for serious bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs accumulate in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney. Over time, they generate reactive oxygen species (free radicals), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2043284/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;damaging those cells and causing necrosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Once the drug is stopped, kidney function often recovers, but not always completely, especially with higher cumulative doses or long therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: dehydration, existing CKD, liver disease, low albumin, or when used together with other nephrotoxic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: When aminoglycosides are necessary, clinicians often monitor drug levels, adjust dose, ensure good hydration, and avoid other harmful drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vancomycin and other glycopeptides&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vancomycin is a powerful antibiotic often used to treat resistant bacterial infections. But it's not harmless: it has a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4892398/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;known risk of kidney toxicity,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; especially when used at high doses or combined with other nephrotoxins (like aminoglycosides).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism isn’t always simple, sometimes the patient’s illness (for example, sepsis) also contributes, but vancomycin independently increases the risk of acute kidney injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: high trough levels, prolonged therapy, and co-use of other kidney-stressing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Drug dosing needs precision, and kidney function should be monitored closely during therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Radiocontrast agents&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast dyes used in imaging (CT scans, angiography) can sometimes spark contrast-induced nephropathy. These agents can reduce kidney blood flow, generate oxidative stress, and cause direct tubular toxicity. This is especially risky if someone already has &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2043284/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;impaired kidney function or is dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: diabetes, existing CKD, dehydration, repeated contrast exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Before any diagnostic scan that uses dye, discuss your kidney health. Preventive measures include hydration, using the lowest contrast dose, and possibly alternative imaging strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drugs that affect kidney hemodynamics (ACE Inhibitors / ARBs Combined with Other Risks)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACE inhibitors (like lisinopril) and ARBs (like losartan) are often life-saving drugs for hypertension, heart failure, and kidney disease, but under certain conditions, they can worsen kidney function transiently. These medicines dilate the efferent arteriole (part of the kidney’s blood filter), which lowers glomerular pressure. In most cases, that’s beneficial, but if combined with dehydration, NSAIDs, diuretics, or sudden drop in blood volume, it can contribute to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4975270/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;acute kidney injury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this kind of decline is often reversible, it requires close monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Adding to this Dr Gupta said, "ACE inhibitors and ARBs, such as lisinopril, enalapril, and ramipril, help regulate excessive blood pressure and protect the heart. They too can occasionally cause renal impairment, particularly if you are dehydrated or on other kidney-damaging medications. Diuretics drain excess fluid from the body and are often used to treat high blood pressure and edema. However, if not utilized properly, they can cause dehydration, putting stress on the kidneys and perhaps causing damage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Never stop these medicines abruptly, but always inform your doctor if you’re vomiting, dehydrated, or taking other high-risk drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we need to know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden risk in “safe” meds: Over-the-counter painkillers (NSAIDs) are often underestimated. People think they’re harmless, but over time and especially in vulnerable individuals, they can quietly erode kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy of harm: It’s not just one drug, the real damage often happens when multiple “almost safe” medicines interact (for example, NSAIDs + ACE inhibitors + diuretics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person on painkillers long-term may not even realise their kidneys are being stressed, because the early signs are subtle. Empowering patients with knowledge (especially in India, where self-medication is common) could prevent a lot of silent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for educational purposes only and does not replace medical advice.

More than &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/high-blood-pressure-understanding-silent-killer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;119 million US adults have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, according to the US Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration’s 2024 data. However, only one in four of those people has their condition under control. While many assume hypertension is harmless, the truth is far from it. A groundbreaking study has now found that hypertension damages the brain even before the fluctuations show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research from Weill Cornell Medicine found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00799-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;hypertension damages the brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; days before blood pressure increases. These findings could reshape how doctors treat the condition. The preclinical findings are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Neuron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hypertension affects the brain much earlier than expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new preclinical study by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators found that hypertension impairs blood vessels, neurons, and white matter in the brain even before the condition causes a measurable rise in blood pressure. These findings help explain why hypertension is a major risk factor for developing cognitive disorders, such as vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. The study also found that the condition may induce early gene expression changes in individual brain cells that could interfere with thinking and memory. These findings could pave the way for medications that both reduce blood pressure and prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though people with hypertension have a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.039849" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1.2- to 1.5-fold higher risk of developing cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; than others, the reason behind this wasn’t known. While many medications successfully lower high blood pressure, they have little or no effect on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the major cells responsible for cognitive impairment were affected just three days after inducing hypertension in mice—before blood pressure increased. The bottom line is that something beyond the dysregulation of blood pressure is involved,” senior author Dr Costantino Iadecola, director of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, professor of neuroscience and Anne Parrish Titzell Professor of Neurology at Weill Cornell, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early cellular damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, co-led by postdoctoral associate Dr Anthony Pacholko, used advanced single-cell technology to examine how hypertension affects different brain cell types at the molecular level. The researchers induced hypertension in mice using angiotensin, a hormone that raises blood pressure in humans. On the third day, they analysed the brain cells—this was even before blood pressure increased. When they checked again on day 42, the blood pressure was elevated and cognitive function had declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At day three, gene expression changed dramatically in endothelial cells lining blood vessels, interneurons regulating nerve signals, and oligodendrocytes that maintain myelin sheaths around nerve fibres. They also noticed premature ageing in endothelial cells, with reduced energy metabolism and higher senescence markers. They observed early signs of a weakened blood–brain barrier, which potentially allows harmful molecules into the brain while restricting nutrients. They also observed changes similar to patterns seen in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The extent of the early alterations induced by hypertension was quite surprising. Understanding how hypertension affects the brain at the cellular and molecular levels during the earliest stages of the disease may provide clues to finding ways that can potentially block neurodegeneration,” Dr Pacholko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent brain damage from hypertension &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested losartan, an antihypertensive drug that inhibits angiotensin receptors. They found that the medication reversed early hypertension effects on endothelial cells and interneurons in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some human studies, the data suggest that angiotensin receptor inhibitors may be more beneficial to cognitive health than other drugs that lower blood pressure,” Dr Iadecola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hypertension is a leading cause of damage to the heart and the kidneys, which can be prevented by antihypertensive drugs. So, independent of cognitive function, treating high blood pressure is a priority,” Dr Iadecola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

AKI can occur after major stressors such as sepsis or heart surgery, and more than half of all intensive care patients experience it. No approved medications currently exist to treat this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at University of Utah Health (U of U Health) have discovered that fatty molecules called ceramides initiate AKI by damaging the mitochondria that supply energy to kidney cells. By using a backup drug candidate designed to alter how ceramides are processed, the team protected mitochondrial structure and prevented kidney injury in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We completely reversed the pathology of acute kidney injury by inactivating ceramides," says Scott Summers, PhD, distinguished professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and senior author on the study. "We were stunned -- not only did kidney function stay normal, but the mitochondria were unscathed," Summers says. "It was truly remarkable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceramide spikes may serve as an early warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies from the Summers lab showed that ceramides can harm organs such as the heart and liver. When the researchers measured ceramides in AKI models, they found a strong connection: levels rose sharply after injury in both mice and in human urine samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ceramide levels are very elevated in kidney injury," says Rebekah Nicholson, PhD, first author on the work, who completed the research as a graduate student in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Arc Institute. "They go up quickly after damage to the kidneys, and they go up in relation to the severity of the injury. The worse the kidney injury is, the higher the ceramide levels will be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that urinary ceramides could act as an early biomarker for AKI, giving clinicians a tool to identify vulnerable patients, including those preparing for heart surgery, before symptoms begin. "If patients are undergoing a procedure that we know puts them at high risk of AKI, then we can better predict whether or not they're actually going to have one," Nicholson says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altering ceramide production protects kidney function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team nearly eliminated kidney injury in a mouse model by modifying the genetic program that controls ceramide production. This change produced "super mice" that did not develop AKI even under conditions that typically cause severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested a ceramide-lowering drug candidate created by Centaurus Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Summers. Mice treated ahead of time avoided kidney injury, maintained normal kidney function, remained active, and had kidneys that appeared close to normal under the microscope. Nicholson notes that their model places extreme stress on the kidneys, making it "really remarkable that mice were protected from the injury."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These mice looked incredible," Summers adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that ceramides harm mitochondria, the parts of the cell responsible for energy production. Damaged mitochondria in kidney cells become distorted and function poorly. Adjusting ceramide production, whether genetically or with the drug, kept mitochondria intact and working even under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for future therapies targeting mitochondrial health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers explains that the compound used in this study is closely related to, but not identical to, the ceramide-lowering drug that has entered human clinical testing. He emphasizes that mouse results do not always predict human outcomes and that further research is needed to confirm safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're thrilled by how protective this backup compound was, but it's still preclinical," Summers says. "We need to be cautious and do our due diligence to make sure this approach is truly safe before moving it into patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the researchers are encouraged by the findings. If the results extend to people, the drug could potentially be administered ahead of time to individuals who face a high risk of AKI, including patients undergoing heart surgery, where about one quarter experience the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the drug appears to work by maintaining mitochondrial health, the team believes that the approach may have relevance for other disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mitochondrial problems show up in so many diseases -- heart failure, diabetes, fatty liver disease," Summers says. "So if we can truly restore mitochondrial health, the implications could be enormous."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are published in Cell Metabolism as "Therapeutic Remodeling of the Ceramide Backbone Prevents Kidney Injury."&lt;/p&gt;

But a &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/connecting-neurons/202510/plastics-in-the-brain-what-science-is-revealing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Psychology Today showed it's much closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;St. George's University psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Ryznar used to view plastic as an ocean problem, but when the pandemic slowed life down, it became personal. She cooked more at home, hiked often, and noticed plastic piling up in her kitchen and along the trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That made the issue personal, and I spent three years changing my own habits to be low-plastic," she told the publication. The change also motivated her to study plastics closely and learn how they impact human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have detected microplastics and nanoplastics — the minuscule plastic bits from clothes, packaging, and tires — in human brains. They reported that these plastics move through the blood and trigger inflammation typical of brain illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Ryznar stated that the smaller particles can even reach the brain through the lungs and nose, using the same nerves people use to smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related studies on inhaled microplastic fibers and respiratory health have shown how common breathing plastic dust has become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is finding plastic in the brain concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Plastic in the human brain — or in any part of the body — isn't normal. These studies turn plastic waste from an ecological issue into a human health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are tons of chemicals in plastics, such as bisphenol A, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and phthalates, that make them sturdy and flexible. But these chemicals can disrupt hormones, triggering mood swings and slowing brain growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These tiny plastics are just one of several environmental stressors that may affect mental and brain health. For example, some studies show how heat affects those who are on psychiatric medications. Others tie air pollution to children's brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics accumulate over time in both the environment and the human body. One plastic straw can last about two centuries, &lt;a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/blogs/the-lifecycle-of-plastics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to WWF Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, a study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33130380/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that people take in up to five grams of microplastics weekly through water, food intake, and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about plastic exposure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Ryznar suggested making small daily choices to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cut plastic exposure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cut plastic exposure&lt;/a&gt;.

But, like regular linens, they need to be cleaned every now and then to remove residue to keep working effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you toss your microfiber towels in the wash with clothes or &lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-wash-towels-8667565" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other towels&lt;/a&gt;, it's important to know the proper process for cleaning these essentials to keep the fibers intact. We spoke to several cleaning experts for their professional tips on how to wash microfiber towels the right way to keep from ruining them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cleaning your microfiber towels, there are two ways you can go about this: a simple toss in the washing machine or washing by hand. We've broken down the two process step by step so you know how to use both options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--OL"&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Separate Microfiber Towels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may seem smart to wash your microfiber towels with other bath linens and bedding sheets to knock them all out at once, but microfiber towels need to be washed in their own load.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of the fiber material, microfiber towels are notorious for attracting lint that can come from other materials in the wash.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Add In a Gentle Cleaner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before running your cycle, you'll want to add in a gentle cleaner to remove dirt, grime, and residue from your microfiber towels. "Many commercial (grocery store) detergents contain harsh chemicals that degrade the towel fibers," says Ceconi. "We recommend using a gentle detergent that's concentrated, pH-neutral to protect fabric and skin, and cleans with natural detergent enzymes."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Run a Normal Cycle &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you need to be more cautious about what's in your microfiber towel load and the cleaner you use, know that it's okay to run a normal setting for the actual wash. Ceconi recommends selecting a lukewarm setting for the wash to preserve your fibers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceconi says it's extremely important to never wash your microfiber towels with chlorine bleach or fabric softener. He says chlorine bleach will damage and face your towels, while fabric softener doesn't soften your towels at all. "The truth is that fabric softeners don't soften fabric. Instead, they deposit a waxy coating over the fibers that damages your towels absorbency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-step-by-step-handwashing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Step-By-Step: Handwashing &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--OL"&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prep Your Wash Solution &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To wash your microfiber towels, Cohoon says you will need a bucket or sink that is filled with warm water mixed with a few drops of gentle dish soap. "Avoid fabric softeners and bleach, as they can coat or break down the fibers," she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Soak &amp;amp; Agitate the Towels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next you will need to soak your towels in the solution for 10-15 minutes. Once the time is up, Cohoon says to gently rub them together with your hands to clean off the dirt, grime, and residue from your towels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After you've washed all your towels, drain your soapy water and then rinse each towel completely under running water until the soap suds are completely gone. Then, ring out the excess water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-drying-dos-and-donts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Drying Dos And Don'ts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like washing your microfiber towels, you have two drying options: tossing in the drying machine or air drying. "Air drying is best for microfiber towels," Cohoon says. "All you need to do is hang each towel until they're fully dry, but them out of direct heat."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have limited space or want your towels to dry faster, it is possible to run them through a drying cycle, but of course there are a few precautions. "Microfiber towels should be dried on as low a heat as possible to preserve the integrity of the fibers and the durability of the bindings/finishes on the towels," says Ceconi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you choose this method, there's one product Ceconi says you should never add to the dryer with your microfiber towels. "Also, as I mentioned above with fabric softener, never use dryer sheets. These work in essentially the same way as liquid fabric softener by depositing a waxy coating on your towels that will ruin their feel, look, and performance over time."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once your microfiber towels are clean, you'll want to store them properly so their fibers stay strong and effective. Here are a few storage tips to keep your microfiber towels in prime working condition:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Store in a cool, dry place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your towels in a ziplock bag to prevent moisture from building up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never put your towels in a humid or high-heat environment to prevent mold and mildew.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't store microfiber towels with other linens to prevent the transfer of lint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like most things around the house, you'll need to &lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/home/cleaning-and-housekeeping/when-to-get-new-towels" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;replace your microfiber towels&lt;/a&gt; after an extended period of time. Once your microfiber towels begin to lose their softness or functionality, especially with water absorption, it's time for a fresh set. You'll also know it's time to swap out your microfiber towels when they begin to fray or pull apart.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it's better to wash microfiber towels alone. If washed with other items, lint can transfer to them and be difficult to remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="2"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use lukewarm water to wash microfiber towels. This keeps the fibers intact while killing bacteria, without risking shrinking or damage from too much heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can use vinegar and baking soda to wash microfiber towels. They help remove odors and buildup naturally. Just be sure to avoid fabric softeners or harsh commercial products that can harm the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate odors from microfiber towels, add vinegar and baking soda to your wash. They effectively break down smells for fresh, clean towels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="5"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_5-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to wash your microfiber towels after each use or every three uses to keep them clean and in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A Washington state resident has bird flu, and it’s a different type than what was seen in previous infections, state health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the nation’s first human case of bird flu since February. The older adult with underlying health conditions remains hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-h5n1-poultry-human-case-5732c6be85f45c9f61a11a7aa2f0eef3"&gt;had announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the preliminary bird flu diagnosis on Thursday. On Friday, they said it had been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person was infected with a bird flu called H5N5, state officials said. State and federal health officials said it appears to be the first known human infection with the H5N5 bird flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That version is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“These viruses behave similarly,” said Richard Webby, a prominent flu researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. “My gut instinct is to consider it the same as H5N1 from a human health perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued a similar statement that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency is awaiting a specimen from Washington to conduct additional testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Think along the lines of different brands of car tires. They both do the same job, it’s just each is better tuned for specific conditions, which we don’t fully understand,” Webby wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N5 may have a different preference for which kind of birds it most readily infects, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grays Harbor County resident, who has not been identified, has a backyard flock of domestic poultry that had been exposed to wild birds, health officials said. They believe the domestic poultry or wild birds are the most likely source of exposure, but say they are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;Every time you step outside, you pick up two or three bites. You’re swatting miniature pests left and right, and it seems like something is always buzzing in your ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you’re not crazy. The mosquitoes in Phoenix have been fucking awful this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mosquito complaints made to the Maricopa County Vector Control Division, which monitors and deals with mosquito populations, have increased 400% compared to a year ago. In 2024, the county received about 1,500 complaints, division manager John Townsend told Phoenix New Times. This year, complaints have skyrocketed to 6,000 — so far.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="fundraising-thermometer-block wp-block-vmg-fundraising-thermometer"&gt;
			&lt;div class="container"&gt;
				&lt;div class="fundraising-thermometer-wrapper"&gt;
											&lt;h2 class="fundraising-thermometer-headline"&gt;
							&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When news happens, Phoenix New Times is there —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Your support strengthens our coverage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;						&lt;/h2&gt;
					
											&lt;p class="fundraising-thermometer-body"&gt;
							We’re aiming to raise $30,000 by December 31, so we can continue covering what matters most to you. If New Times matters to you, please take action and contribute today, so when news happens, our reporters can be there.						&lt;/p&gt;
					
											
					
					
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
					
								
					
&lt;p&gt;Townsend also said that while the Valley has typical mosquito complaint hotspots — particularly in the East Valley — complaints have come from all over the county this year. Vector Control sets traps to monitor mosquito activity at 850 sites across the Phoenix metro area and is finding a lot of mosquitoes where they usually are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Typically, in the southeast Valley — Queen Creek, Chandler, Gilbert and Mesa, and areas with flood irrigation — we get a lot of mosquitoes and complaints because they’re irrigating their property every two weeks,” Townsend said. “This past month, it’s been more widespread. We have a lot of areas collecting water that normally don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mosquito problem in Phoenix hasn’t been this bad in nearly a decade, he said. “The last time it was close to this activity was eight or nine years ago,” Townsend said, “when, later in the year, three different hurricanes came up from Mexico.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking, “Huh, we’ve had a lot of rain this year, too” — congrats, you’re on your way to earning a mosquito PhD. Phoenix’s mosquito situation was remarkably worse than usual this October because of all the rain the Valley got at the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;
				
									
					
&lt;p&gt;Those storms left standing water that settled all over the Valley, creating a perfect egg-laying environment for mosquitoes. The warm (but not excessively hot) temperatures in late October provided ideal conditions for those pesky buggers to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meet-the-mosquitoes"&gt;Meet the mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One type of mosquito has thrived more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
				
									
					
&lt;p&gt;More water in unusual places, like buckets or empty pots, means that floodwater mosquito populations have popped off. Thankfully, floodwater mosquitoes bite during the day and don’t carry diseases as much as other species in the Valley. These annoying, smaller insects are what experts consider to be a “nuisance mosquito,” Townsend said, ready to  “ruin your picnic or barbeque” but not your health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all mosquitoes are created equal. Kelsey Lyberger, a mosquito ecology researcher at Arizona State University, said that the mosquito explosion has been diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, it wasn’t just a single species,” Lyberger said. “We’re seeing a whole bunch of species, like floodwater species to Yellow Fever-carrying mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti), to a couple of Culex species, which transmit West Nile Virus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those species, unlike the floodwater mosquitoes, tend to live in and around more permanent bodies of water. Their activity has also increased substantially. The Valley has seen 46 cases of West Nile Virus this year, more than double the figure last year. In addition, one person tested positive last week for St. Louis Encephalitis, another disease carried by Culex mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
				
									
					
&lt;p&gt;However, Lyberger isn’t too worried about the ongoing threat of those viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s late enough in the season that we don’t expect West Nile to be a big threat anymore,” she said. “Once those temperatures cool, those populations are going to drop off very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same pattern is expected with floodwater mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, as the weather cools down, this floodwater mosquito activity will start to subside,” Townsend said. “We’re still seeing some in our traps, but not anything like what we were seeing a month ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-almost-over"&gt;Almost over?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a complicating factor, though: rainstorms are expected to grip the Phoenix metro area intermittently from Saturday until the following weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosquito survival — our human sanity — may depend on whether the moisture or the lower temperatures have a bigger effect on the bugs. The rain could lead to another wave of heightened mosquito activity, or the cooler temperatures could bring a drop. &lt;/p&gt;
				
									
					
&lt;p&gt;“I still think temperature is going to win out,” Lyberger said. “There might be a nice habitat, but I don’t expect to see any huge numbers in the following few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when temperatures drop for winter, the current mosquito problem could come roaring back next spring. As both experts noted, mosquitoes can lay eggs that lay dormant for months — or, in some cases, a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If it’s a relatively mild winter, I do think you’d see boosted spring populations,” Lyberger said. “But if it’s a cold winter and they die out, I would go back to baseline prediction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to prevent another mosquito-pocalypse, Townsend has an easy tip to stop floodwater mosquito populations from running wild in your space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After a rain, do yourself a favor and turn anything over in your backyard that’s holding water,” he said. “You’ll do yourself a favor by not having these mosquitoes bugging you all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Scientists are sounding the alarm: this winter’s upcoming flu season in North America could be a real nightmare, thanks to the rapid arrival of a variant that doesn’t match well with the seasonal flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Canada issued the warning in a paper late last month. An unexpected variant of the H3N2 flu, dubbed subclade K, quickly emerged during the tail end of the flu season in the Southern Hemisphere this year, they noted. Subclade K is now poised to become one of the most dominant variants of the flu season in the U.S. and Canada, and it’s likely that our vaccines will be less effective overall this winter against the flu than experts had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While mismatched vaccines can still provide protection against circulating variants, enhanced surveillance is warranted,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A drifting mismatch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the peak of a flu season, multiple variants of influenza A and influenza B viruses will spread between people.  Because it takes about nine months to ramp up enough vaccines for everyone in a given hemisphere, scientists and health authorities meet twice a year (once for the northern half, once for the southern) to predict which variants are most likely to circulate in the population, and thus, which variants a seasonal flu vaccine should cover. Part of this educated guesswork comes from tracking the flu strains moving across the globe at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Usually, the predictions aren’t too far off, and the vaccines will provide at least moderate protection from illness. But flu viruses are always evolving, and variants can gradually develop mutations (a process called drift) that make them significantly different from what scientists had expected them to look like. That seems to be what’s happened here with the latest versions of H3N2, a type of influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, an increasing amount of H3N2 variants with concerning mutations emerged during last winter’s flu season in the northern hemisphere. These variants are perhaps one major reason why the U.S. experienced such a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flu-cases-are-surging-heres-why-this-season-is-so-unusual-2000561630"&gt;hard-hitting flu&lt;/a&gt; this past winter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More recently, a further drifted and poorly matched lineage of H3N2—subclade K—emerged toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere. This lineage is now “projected to predominate among A(H3N2) viruses for the NH 2025–2026 season,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The possibility remains that subclade K will not spread widely in North America, since there will be other circulating variants of flu around at the same time. But the odds of that aren’t looking too good. In the UK, health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;already announced&lt;/a&gt; an early start to its flu season, with a majority of these cases being caused by subclade K. Hospitals in the region are now preparing for a big surge of flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth wondering whether the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/irreparably-damaged-former-senior-official-details-the-darkest-days-of-the-cdc-under-rfk-jr-2000673201"&gt;fractured state of public health&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. will further hamper efforts to contain the flu. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have overseen dramatic funding cuts and layoffs throughout the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies this year, while RFK Jr. has fired or pressured senior health officials to leave the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why vaccines still matter&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the dire outlook, vaccines remain one of the most important tools against the flu this season. There are other strains of flu that the vaccine will cover, and a mismatched vaccine can still provide some protection against the worst outcomes of flu, which can include death. Thankfully, there is good news on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week, the UK Health Security Agency &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;the latest data from its flu surveillance program. Even with a mismatched variant in the picture, the vaccine is currently estimated to be 70% to 75% effective at preventing flu hospitalizations in children and 30% to 40% effective in adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These results provide reassuring evidence that this season’s flu vaccines currently offer important protection to children and adults, despite concerns about the new subclade,” said Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for Immunization at UKHSA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So it’s still worthwhile to get your flu shot as soon as you can. But given the mismatch this winter, it’s all the more important to practice good hygiene, to stay home if you’re sick, and to potentially wear a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection (well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 being the most effective).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 21:10:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbzJ3V0kweWo3b2JrNmk0QTY5M2hHWThzV1h3Zk9aRUVEQjZjZElpYUZ3d1Z6MlpDNm0wWXl0Y3V4RHJvUVlyYkl4RzI4SGhPQmdUcFdoejZWX3VCOVVDcHJCZUt6MVRrakUwMGdEb2NxbXRZQi11NkpqR1FqMXdYblRPeXdzbldMa1JZcXg5OThDemkxTXA2RmNtNzhjd2Z6Rkdpam9pNnY</guid></item><item><title>随着关闭的结束，可疑的CDC小组重新开始拆除疫苗接种计划- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/as-shutdown-ends-dubious-cdc-panel-gets-back-to-dismantling-vaccine-schedule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Kennedy’s ACIP members planned to push the first dose back a month. A vote was prepared to recommend &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;giving a birth dose unless there was “individual based decision-making.” While at first the panel seemed poised to vote in favor of the change, the plan collapsed with basic questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting ACIP member Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist, noted: “I’m unclear if we’ve been presented with any safety or data comparing before one month to after one month,” he said. They had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And,” Hibbeln continued, “I’m wondering why one month was selected as our time point and if there are data to help to inform us if there’s greater risk of adverse effects before one month or after one month at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no data suggesting that such a move would be more or less safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion quickly spiraled from there with an eventual vote of 11-1 to table voting on the vaccine recommendation. According to the Federal Register notice, ACIP will try to take up the topic again. They could revive the vote or attack some other aspect of vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pediatricians fight back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts have blasted Kennedy’s lineup and their attacks on childhood vaccines, including the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. The current schedule “remains the best protection against serious health problems like liver disease and cancer,” the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasized to Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ACIP’s standing tarnished under Kennedy, AAP has put forth its own evidence-based vaccine schedule for pediatricians to trust. They’ve also been a prominent opponent among medical organizations to Kennedy’s efforts. For instance, in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.286605/gov.uscourts.mad.286605.139.0.pdf"&gt;a revised federal lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, the AAP along with other medical organizations is seeking to overturn all decisions made by Kennedy’s ACIP and replace the entire panel with actual experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s appointees “lack the credentials and experience required of their role,” and all their votes should be declared “null and void,” the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAP President Susan Kressly &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682/Updated-AAP-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-ACIP-members"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that pediatricians are already seeing the effects of having an anti-vaccine activist as the US health secretary, namely “fear, decreased vaccine confidence, and barriers for families to access vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The nation’s children are already paying the price in avoidable illnesses and hospitalizations,” Kressly said. “We urge federal leaders to restore the science-based deliberative process that has made the United States a global leader in public health. Urgent action is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

The participants viewed 2,180 videos without sound that were seconds long and varied in content among objects, scenes and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large language models — generative AI systems trained on large datasets — took captions of the video clips and turned those captions into sequences of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horikawa trained separate, simpler AI models, known as "decoders," to match the scanned brain activity related to the video clips to the numerical sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then used the decoders to interpret the study participants' brain activity while they watched or recalled videos that the AI had not encountered during the training process. Another algorithm was created to progressively generate word sequences that best matched the decoded brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the AI learned from the data, the descriptive text tool became better and better at using the brain scans to describe the videos the participants had watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just one additional step forward in the direction of what, in my view, we can legitimately call brain-reading or mind-reading," Marcello Ienca, a professor of the ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich in Germany and president-elect of the International Neuroethics Society, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential for 'profound' health interventions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI model generated text in English, even though the participants were not native English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method can create comprehensive descriptions of visual content, even without using the activity in language-related regions of the brain, or the "language network," Horikawa said, "indicating that this method can be used even when someone has damage around that language network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology could potentially be used to assist people with aphasia, who struggle with language expression due to damage around the language network; or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects speech, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this study paves the way for some profound interventions for people who have difficulty communicating, including nonverbal autistic people," said psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, a lecturer at Barnard College in New York who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "we have to use it carefully and make sure we aren't being invasive and that everyone consents to it," he told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'The ultimate privacy challenge'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of this method — which could be applied to decode the thoughts of infants or animals, or the content of dreams — "raises ethical concerns" regarding privacy, with the possibility of disclosing an individual's private thoughts before they have verbalized them, the study noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If in the future this technology is used by consumers beyond biomedical purposes, "I think this is the ultimate privacy challenge," Ienca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there are many companies, such as Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain implant startup, that are making public claims about soon developing neural implants for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we get there, then we need to have very, very strict rules when it comes to granting access to people's minds and brains," Ienca said, highlighting that our brains include "sensitive information" such as "signatures of early dementia and psychiatric disorders and depression."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Cell in August suggested that the "leakage" of private inner thoughts during decoding could be prevented by a mechanism in which the user thinks of a particular keyword to unlock the decoding tool only when intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "neuroscience is moving fast and the assistive potential is huge — but mental privacy and freedom of thought protections can't wait," said social scientist Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, an assistant professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and a director of European Affairs at the Neurorights Foundation in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should treat neural data as sensitive by default, require explicit purpose-limited consent, and prioritize on-device processing with user-controlled 'unlock' mechanisms. Reliance on AI introduces additional regulatory and cybersecurity challenges and underscores the need for complementary, AI-specific legal framework," Szoszkiewicz, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Horikawa noted that the method used in his study requires a large amount of data collection, with the cooperation of active participants. So, while the technology is useful for neuroscientific research, it is "not so accurate for practical use," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the videos used in the study included typical scenes of, for example, a dog biting a man, but not more unusual scenes — say, a man biting a dog. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the technique could be used to capture less predictable mental images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, "while some people may worry that this technology poses serious risk to mental privacy," in reality, "the current approach cannot easily read a person's private thoughts," Horikawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Because of this, officials advise anyone who was at the Taylorsville InstaCare during that time period to check their MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If people have received one or two doses of the MMR vaccine, they are considered immune, according to the health department. After receiving two vaccines, officials say people are protected from measles infections 97% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The measles case in Salt Lake City is the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;77th confirmed in Utah this year&lt;/a&gt;, and the 13th confirmed in the state within the last three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In late October, Salt Lake County health officials believed a different person was infected, but said that person refused to be tested or take part in an investigation. Without those results, officials said they could not confirm the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;That unconfirmed case is not related to the case confirmed this week, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Throughout the United States, health officials have confirmed 1,700 cases confirmed by 42 states, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The national outbreak comes as fewer kindergartners are receiving the MMR vaccine, the CDC has reported. If more than 95% of a community is vaccinated, the CDC says they can achieve “herd immunity.” However, the agency reports, kindergartners’ vaccination rates nationwide dropped from 95.2% in the 2019-20 school year to 92.7% in 2023-24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Numbers stray even further from herd immunity in Utah, where the CDC estimates only 88.8% of kindergartners were adequately vaccinated against measles during the 2023-24 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 20:23:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4wdkNrTGVHbjRYTzUyR0l5aWlNLWdiRkJjdjRJNC1uWVFiMTdYeFRVOVlTOThsZ3JjOGRrNTlnb0hyR0RhdXJKNGRURFhmeU41MTl2c094V0tFcEd6WjlucDlSMk9BN0pXXzlpTmx2dU1PckM0OW16TE5n</guid></item><item><title>盐湖县在全国范围内确认首例麻疹病例- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51405526/salt-lake-county-confirms-its-first-case-of-measles-amid-nationwide-outbreak</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — The Salt Lake County Health Department on Friday confirmed a measles infection in an adult resident — the first lab-confirmed case identified in the county amid a current nationwide outbreak of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected individual is unvaccinated, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case is especially concerning because the source of the patient's infection is unknown," Dorothy Adams, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "They have not knowingly had contact with anyone who had measles, which means their infection is the result of transmission somewhere out in the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department said epidemiologists are working quickly to notify anyone the patient may have exposed and all personal contacts of the infected individual have already been notified individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, health officials say the patient visited one public location while they were infectious and people who were at the following location during the indicated date and times may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taylorsville InstaCare, 3845 W. 4700 South, on Friday, Nov. 7, from 3 p.m. to 7:15 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials in October &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51397304/salt-lake-county-identifies-its-first-probable-case-of-measles-amid-nationwide-outbreak" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; what they believed was the first case of measles reported in the county, but they were unable to confirm the diagnosis because the patient declined to participate in their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient has declined to be tested or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact," Adams said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread to as many as nine out of 10 unprotected people who are near an infected person, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; County officials say two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are the best way to prevent infection and limit the severity of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but cases this year have spiked nationwide to the highest level since then. Utah has reported 77 confirmed cases this year, the majority in southwest Utah, according to the state's Measles Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically manifest seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, according to the department. Patients with measles typically have tiny white spots appear inside their mouth two to three days after symptoms begin and get a rash within three to five days of the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will need hospitalization, according to the department, with young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who suspect they may have been exposed to measles are asked to contact their health care provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Instead, it says that “treatment is limited to supportive care”, including rest and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Ethiopia was reported in the country’s southern region of Omo, which borders South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya said on Thursday that the outbreak was a concern because “&lt;a href="/where/south-sudan/"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; isn’t far and has a fragile health system”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other African country has reported Marburg virus cases in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tedros, the WHO chief, said on Friday that the UN agency was “actively supporting Ethiopia to contain the outbreak and treat infected people, and supporting all efforts to address the potential of cross-border spread”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian Ministry of Health also said that community-wide screenings were being conducted in relation to the outbreak, alongside efforts to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people have been isolated and are being treated, it said in a statement shared on social media, while work to identify anyone who may have come into contact with suspected cases was also under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry urged people not to panic, to follow instructions from the health authorities, and to seek medical care if they exhibit any signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:56:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOTU96Yk5nRHgwU0VmdlowU0d1ekdjV0lQdUdpc1phQ0tJaTdrelVXckRlR0NlRGNKd0tLR3VsLU9nbkJMYmtZVGlyOGxSZGctQ1k0VDNYUzZqYkx6NFZxcTFyeFV6dDZ4TlRzRTBBQVdZVnNMRmdnMlBfRk9aZ2ZpSXhxajZTcFdWcWJRb2tEcm05OWFDdGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMUFV2eXBTcW5ZYkdFcnE3cUxmRTdSZjhRX3dGVENJMjhmZUNiR3EzYXMzOGowMDZjTzVnWkdCRDVMQ1BLYUg0Skc2aUt6dGJDV01DRVhPWmlud1lWVzUxVHJMdUtURkh1cHpPNTZ1S1ZfVnpsVWQtNUd3WlpPMHhtYXNkV2NLUG5jdGF4Tld1d2VuYmt5bG8zblNBVTQ</guid></item><item><title>9个月内首例美国人类禽流感病例确诊，以前仅在动物身上见过- abcnews.go.com</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/suspected-human-bird-flu-case-1st-us-9/story?id=127519769</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A Washington state resident has tested positive for bird flu, marking the first human case confirmed in the U.S. in nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The patient, who is an older adult with underlying health conditions, developed symptoms including high fever, confusion and respiratory distress and was hospitalized in early November, according to the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Testing confirmed the patient has H5N5, a strain of bird flu that has previously been reported in animals but never before in humans, according to the Washington State Department of Health.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="194" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw000vphkwiotsjdm5@published"&gt;My 67-year-old dad has been sick with a rare cancer since 2017. Without going too much into the saga of his surgeries/treatments, it’s been a battle with many ups and downs. Up until more recently, he was managing well and able to do most of the activities that he loves to do, including spending time with his grandchildren. He has become very thin and weaker than ever before, with frequent exhaustion that requires a lot of rest. There are no more treatment options, and it’s unclear what the management looks like from here. There is no formal prognosis, but I fear that the rate things are going he does not have a lot of time left. My mom, who has been his caretaker, is also exhausted and emotionally drained from this. My question revolves around talking about this with my son, “Freddie.” Freddie just turned 4, and because my dad has mostly been able to do regular things with us when we visit (we live four hours away by car), I’ve never actually told him that his grandpa is sick. It seemed way too complicated to discuss with him, especially before he was 4.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz7nms200113b78qrc88l86@published"&gt;How do you prepare a young child for the passing of their grandparent? Do I even discuss it with him yet? We have not really had an official conversation about death before, outside of seeing roadkill or a bug being squished. We haven’t talked about dying in regards to people. I don’t want to talk about it too soon, because I know it would take away from the time that he does spend with my dad, not to mention make my dad feel uncomfortable or sad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zt6v000b3b78o7di9egd@published"&gt;But would waiting make it more difficult? Freddie is very social with great language skills and a mind like a steel trap, and I know if I were to discuss something with him, he’d likely talk about it with or in front of grandma/grandpa. I’m also trying to emotionally prepare myself for losing my dad, something that seemed like a death sentence almost 10 years ago, and it feels incredibly heavy and weighs on my mind a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztg7000d3b787gomjgww@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Preparing, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zthq000e3b780qvxa2t4@published"&gt;You’re doing such a good job, and you should continue to follow your gut here. I think it’s been the right move to avoid talking about your dad’s illness with your son, and I think you should put it off as long as you can. What a gift, in a time of pain and anxiety, to have a child who is oblivious to it. Give your dad and yourself (and your son!) this gift as long as it keeps making sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztju000f3b7830m15q4e@published"&gt;It’s likely that pretty soon, Freddie will notice that something is different, and there will be something material that you can talk about with him. For example, if your dad follows the usual trajectory of a person with untreatable cancer, his energy will continue to decrease. He’ll stop leaving the house, then stop leaving his bed. Whether you and Freddie are doing video calls or in-person visits, these are things that your son will notice, and you can talk to him about it. Keep your explanations simple and straight-forward. So you might say, “We’re going to visit grandpa, and he’s going to be in his bed because he’s very sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztmu000g3b789dhc4ie0@published"&gt;You don’t need to tell Freddie that granddad is dying—wait to tell him about death until your dad has died. I know you’re worried about “preparing” him, but as you’re finding, even adults can’t really “prepare” ourselves for the death of our loved ones. Even once your dad goes on hospice, it could be weeks or months before he dies—everyone’s timeline is their own. That uncertainty is going to be hard enough for you; protect your son from it, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztoa000h3b786m0c5kxa@published"&gt;When your dad does die, use simple language to tell your son, something like: “Grandpa died, it means we can’t see him or talk to him anymore, but we can talk about him and look at pictures and know that he loved us very much.” And it’s OK to be sad about it with him! He’ll have a lot of questions, and again, just be a straightforward and honest as possible. And it’s OK to say, “I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz752sd000p3b78udugvyzb@published"&gt;It can really help  to read about how other people have handled these conversations, because you’ll see that there is no “one right way.” You might also find language that resonates with you. This &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1fwsnju/please_help_me_explain_death_to_my_4_year_old_one/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; has some really thoughtful responses. This &lt;a href="https://cupofjo.com/2015/04/27/how-to-talk-to-kids-about-death/"&gt;Cup of Jo post&lt;/a&gt; is gold, and the comments section is also a really wonderful font of wisdom. And of course, our columnists have written on this topic in the past: &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/talk-children-death-advice.html"&gt;Allison Price&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/01/funerals-grief-education-opportunity-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;Nicole Cliffe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/05/parenting-advice-for-a-grandpa-who-must-explain-death-to-his-grandson-and-a-mom-who-doesnt-want-to-deliver-a-hat.html"&gt;Carvell Wallace&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/07/parenting-advice-how-to-handle-end-of-life-care-with-kids-in-the-house.html"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;). Good luck, you can do this. And I’m sorry that your father is so ill. You’re doing a good job, for your dad and your son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw000zphkwhk2v8m40@published"&gt;My 3-year-old son is going through a phase where he refuses to wear clothes. In the mornings, I have to literally dress him and get him to the car ASAP when we leave for his daycare, because if I leave him unattended for so much as a minute, everything comes off and I have to start all over. His daycare has had some success in keeping him clothed, but if they don’t watch him carefully he’ll soon be wearing his birthday suit. It’s getting to the point where they have said he will not be able to come back if the problem isn’t resolved. My husband thinks that since the weather is getting colder, the solution is to let him go outside without his clothes on so he can “learn what they’re for.” I’m not willing to risk him getting hypothermia just to prove a point. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

We don’t &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;wear clothes to keep us warm in the cold. We wear them because, in our society, it’s an universal rule, in public and in many private businesses (like daycares!), that we wear clothes that cover our bodies. Also: Many kids feel temperature differently, and it’s entirely possible your son could go out in the cold naked and be perfectly comfortable and undeterred in the least. He might also get hypothermia, so like, let’s just nip that one in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz89prq00193b78vol1slit@published"&gt;You’re on a daycare deadline, so Instead of trying to make a behavior change, I think you’ve got to make a clothes change and dress him in clothes that he can’t take off—the most common suggestion I’ve seen for this is one-piece pajamas worn backwards, so the zips or snaps are in the back. And while you’re at it, I’d make sure the ones you’re picking are soft, breathable, and don’t have tags inside in case he’s stripping because his clothes are uncomfortable. (Often, brands label these as “sensory friendly.”) You might have to try several options, but hopefully you can get one that he’ll tolerate (I expect that he’ll try to take anything off at first, but will soon move on.) I think this will be a blip. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw0015phkwtywk3c3y@published"&gt;Is there such a thing as taking too many pictures of your kids? My husband, who is a great father, is really fanatical about taking photos of our only child, a 3-year-old girl. He takes pictures of her CONSTANTLY. He thinks it’s important to document every day, so he’ll take a minimum of 10 photos daily, along with a few short videos. That’s just on an average day. If anything remotely interesting happens—a new toy, an outing, a new skill—he’ll take dozens of photos and 10–20 minutes of video. He has videos of her &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/childhood-photos-too-many-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;singing every song she knows, every word she tries to say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

No pictures were needed – just the taste and scent of the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smell is the quietest of our senses, but also one of the most powerful. Indeed, it can even &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-tantalising-scent-of-rain-or-freshly-baked-bread-why-can-certain-smells-transport-us-back-in-time-212644"&gt;open the floodgates to memories&lt;/a&gt; we thought long forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/three-reasons-strong-perfumes-give-you-a-headache-192063"&gt;the most personal and subjective sense&lt;/a&gt;, which is what makes it so hard for people to agree on what smells good. However, there does seem to be consensus on the worst smell in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1889, in a German laboratory, a chemical reaction involving a compound called &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/things-i-won-t-work-thioacetone"&gt;thioacetone&lt;/a&gt; produced a stink so terrible that it caused people to vomit and faint half a kilometre away, forcing the partial evacuation of the city of Freiburg. We still don’t know what exact reaction caused this stench, but it seems nobody is in a hurry to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when our smell starts to fail? And what if losing smell were more than just a passing symptom?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A shortcut to our emotions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smell is an evolutionary advantage: it warns us of invisible dangers and puts us on alert. Scent can also influence our decisions, and big brands are well aware of this, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dollars-and-scents-how-the-right-smells-can-encourage-shoppers-to-buy-healthier-foods-232973"&gt;perfuming their shops&lt;/a&gt; with fragrances that tap into our emotions and invite us to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smells have the ability to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-strange-science-of-odour-memory-74403"&gt;awaken memories and intense emotions&lt;/a&gt;, and the olfactory bulb is responsible for this. This small area of the forebrain, located very close to the nose, receives olfactory signals and sends them directly to the areas of the brain that manage our memory and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance, smell remains the least well-understood of the senses, and is often underestimated. When it fades, it usually goes unnoticed, but we may not realise how important it is until we lose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happened to &lt;a href="https://thecounter.org/lost-sense-of-smell-covid-19-gastronome-italians/"&gt;Michele Crippa&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned Italian “super taster” who lost his sense of smell during the pandemic. Although he regained it weeks later, his personal nightmare had only just begun, as when his sense of smell came back, it was distorted. Oranges smelled like burnt plastic, peaches smelled like basil, and vanilla made him feel sick. This was likely because the neurons in his olfactory bulb had been damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While any loss of smell is unpleasant, it could have a greater significance: a warning signal from deep with our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A common cold, or Parkinson’s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us have lost our sense of smell at some point, usually thanks to a simple bout of cold or flu. However, this symptom can also be an early &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000006919"&gt;symptom of neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/alzheimers-disease-30935"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/parkinsons-disease-30547"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;. This has been known for some time, but the surprising thing is that the loss of smell occurs years before the symptoms of these diseases appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, could loss of smell be used to predict Parkinson’s disease? The answer, unhelpful though it may be, is: it depends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An early warning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the major problems with neurodegenerative diseases is that the damage is already very advanced by the time they can be diagnosed. In the case of Parkinson’s disease, when the first symptoms (stiffness, tremors, and so on) appear, more than half of the neurons that produce &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dopamine-brain-chemical-helps-us-understand-other-people-raising-hopes-for-new-treatments-232837"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, the neurotransmitter that controls movement, have already been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying early symptoms like loss of smell – which affects up to 90% of patients – could serve as a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/biomarkers-4112"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt;, alerting us to the presence of the disease. This would allow us to diagnose it much earlier, and provide access to more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this symptom is not exclusive to Parkinson’s: it can also appear with ageing, stress, or other conditions. This means we tend to downplay its importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still do not know for certain why neurodegenerative diseases cause loss of smell, although we have some clues. In some Parkinson’s patients, the disease may begin in the olfactory bulb long before spreading to the areas that control movement. This is because certain &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease-what-we-know-dont-know-and-suspect-57579"&gt;viruses, pesticides or toxins&lt;/a&gt; that we inhale could damage it and cause alterations to the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Alzheimer’s disease, damage could begin in a tiny bluish region of the brain stem called the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62500-8"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, as a recent study has revealed. This “alert button” keeps us awake and focused, and its connection to the olfactory bulb is what links smells to emotions. When that connection is broken, problems occur with smell long before the first signs of dementia emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the loss of the ability to smell would not be a symptom of the disease itself, but rather a warning sign that the degenerative process has begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosing through smell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a patient comes into the clinic, it is not always easy to distinguish between Parkinson’s disease and other similar movement disorders. A loss of smell, combined with other tests and indicators, could help confirm the diagnosis. It could also help us predict the disease’s progression, as it is related to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7534008/"&gt;more severe forms of the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the loss of smell in Parkinson’s disease is selective. Patients perceive pleasant smells such as chocolate without issue, but have &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1362763/full"&gt;difficulty detecting neutral or unpleasant odours&lt;/a&gt; like soap, smoke or rubber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other patients, especially women, experience something even stranger: &lt;a href="https://www.prd-journal.com/article/S1353-8020(22)00124-9/fulltext"&gt;olfactory hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;. This means they perceive “phantom” odours, such as tobacco or burning wood, which are not really there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incredible though it may seem, Parkinson’s disease even has its own scent, which has been described as woody and musky. We know this thanks to Joy Milne, a Scottish woman with a heightened sense of smell – she was able to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/07/woman-who-can-smell-parkinsons-helps-scientists-develop-test"&gt;recognise this particular odour&lt;/a&gt; on her husband 12 years before he was diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of smell may seem like like something confined to the nose, but it is actually a window into the brain. It allows researchers to peek inside the brain to decipher its secrets, and to gather valuable information that will help us care for and improve the quality of life of those who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

At her largest she hit 230lbs, classifying her as morbidly obese for her 5ft 2in frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came her moment of humiliation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was explaining to an overweight patient how he could lower his blood pressure naturally by slimming down,when he snapped back: 'Well, you go first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was kind of snickering at me,' Dr Booth &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-3fb08090-c17d-11f0-8556-6fe7e2457a06"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And these awkward encounters became more frequent, with patients pointing out Dr Booth's hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Brittany Booth, pictured left at 320lbs and right today, lost half her body weight over two years after following a diet plan that saw her consume virtually no carbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many overweight people, she had tried every fad diet under the sun, but had always abandoned efforts after being disappointed by slow progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It didn't help that she was prone to comfort eating, often consuming half a tub of ice cream a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the embarrassing encounters with her patients gave her a new determination to shed the weight and she made herself a promise - in August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I decided I didn't care how long it took or how slow the progress was, I was determined to get healthy again,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What followed was a two-year struggle that eventually saw her lose a total of 120lbs - at a pace of about 1lb a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine years on, and now 41, Dr Booth &lt;span&gt;has succeeded in keeping the fat off and today weighs around 110lbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And she has done it all without the use of weight-loss drugs - instead changing her diet and introducing moderate exercise into her routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She began by sifting through online diet plans and quickly noted a striking trend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She learned that &lt;/span&gt;America's obesity problem had begun in the early 1980s, around the time US dietary guidelines promoting a low-fat, high-carb diet were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back then, around 15 percent of Americans were obese, estimates suggest, compared to more than 40 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say few people actually followed the 'low-fat, high-carb' advice, but the guidelines prompted food companies to reformulate their products, cutting fat and adding sugar or refined carbs to make foods taste better and appear 'healthier'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We now know, however, that carbs &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4742721/#:~:text=Abstract,fat%20may%20contain%20more%20sugar."&gt;lead to weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, not fats - though many fad diets have not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Dr Booth decided to flip the script and switched to her own low-carb, high-fat plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She largely focused on healthy, unsaturated fats found in olive oil, fatty fish and, at lower levels, in beef and pork. Doctors now say these can help to improve cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth followed a plan where she ate no carbs for six out of seven days of the week, only meat and vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She did not count her calories and still ate three meals a day, filling her plate with greens and ensuring every meal contained a fist-sized portion of meat for protein - including bacon, chicken, pork and even burgers without the bun&lt;span&gt;. For snacks, she had nuts or cheese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also gave up those daily ice cream binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth also started to incorporate more exercise into her day, steering clear of running or weightlifting, but using other strategies such as parking further away from the office to walk more and talking the stairs instead of the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Booth started her weight loss journey in August 2014 after she noticed some patients snickering at her. She has managed to keep the weight off for nine years after reaching her goal weight in August 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight loss was slow compared to those on weight-loss drugs, and there were some weeks where she did not lose any weight or even gained a few pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to her 1lb-per-week loss, people who turn to Ozempic, Wegovy or similar drugs, typically lose around double the amount of weight every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, she was also juggling work and caring for her children - and because her kids were fussy eaters, she had to make two meals every night, one for herself and another for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, back in 2014, Ozempic was not available when Dr Booth started losing weight. Now, she says, she would definitely have used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that by not resorting to weight-loss drugs she was able to built habits that have allowed her to both lose weight and keep it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 20 percent of people who come off weight-loss drugs manage to maintain their slimmer frame, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13006179/ozempic-wegovy-patients-weight-stopping-drugs.html"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly one in five regain all the weight they have lost and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors say this is likely because they did not also build the healthy habits that would help them to maintain the weight loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think I am happy with the way I lost the weight because it shows that you do it on your own. I think it gives me a little more credibility even,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have this standard now, right now with GLP-1s, where you can lose like ten pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But rapid weight loss is not healthy in general, because it can lead to other medical problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Booth said her weight rose, in part, because she would binge eat ice cream and would use it both as a reward and to relieve stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your body is like an equilibrium, and when you are shifting fat cells and fluids and all of the other components of weight loss, your body has to readjust,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're losing massive amounts of weight too quickly, it can be really dangerous. And then, there is, of course, the cosmetic side of it. You're going to get saggy skin, you're going to get wrinkles. It doesn't look good when you lose weight too quickly. And, also, you lose a lot of muscle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that rapid weight loss involving a very restrictive diet can also lead to nutrient deficiency, muscle loss, fatigue, loose skin and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth said she was '100 percent certain' that the slow weight loss allowed her skin to retract much better than in many Ozempic patients, although she still needed to have some surgery to remove the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally lost a whole person.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet, libraries and bookshops are full of plans and advice on how to lose weight, from fad diets to intense exercise routines. But there could be another route to keeping the pounds away, and that's with a gut bacterium called Turicibacter.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 8 people are living with obesity. This global crisis can cause significant health complications and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. For years, scientists have known that our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-gut-microbiome-brain-bodies.html" rel="related"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; (the trillions of microbes in our digestive system) play a role in our overall health, including how we process fat. But pinpointing the exact beneficial microbes and how they help us has been much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fat-fighting microbe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, new research has identified Turicibacter in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; as a key player, a bacterium long suspected of influencing fat metabolism. In a paper &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413125004413" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, scientists detail exactly how it exerts its protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kendra Klag at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City and her colleagues first isolated the specific Turicibacter bacterium from other microbes. Then they tested its protective effects on different groups of mice, including those bred without any existing gut bacteria and standard lab mice. The mice were fed either a regular diet or a high-fat diet, and some were also given the bacterium as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then measured key health metrics, including body fat, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and blood fat levels. They found that Turicibacter drastically reduced obesity and improved metabolic health even in mice on a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how Turicibacter was doing this, the team analyzed mouse gut and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; and found that the bacteria were producing their own lipids (fat molecules). They purified these bacterial fats and gave them to the mice, and observed that they alone (without the bacteria) were enough to prevent obesity. These lipids helped suppress the body's production of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-unexpected-lipid-obesity-therapies.html" rel="related"&gt;ceramides&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fat that builds up when an individual has a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data identify a novel bacterial-host lipid network that promotes host metabolic health and holds therapeutic promise," wrote the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the research has people wondering whether gut bacteria could be our new weapon against obesity. The idea is not that far-fetched. The researchers also found that low levels of Turicibacter are linked with obesity in humans, which could pave the way for probiotic supplements to treat the metabolic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

By analyzing genetic data from over 150,000 people with depression, researchers identified distinct genetic regions linked specifically to early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with high genetic risk for early-onset depression were twice as likely to attempt suicide within a decade. The findings highlight a critical window for early intervention and suggest that genetics could eventually guide personalized suicide-prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Genetic Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression before age 25 shows stronger genetic influence than late-onset cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Suicide Probability:&lt;/strong&gt; One in four individuals with high early-onset genetic risk attempted suicide within 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Gene Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Twelve genetic regions were linked to early-onset depression, compared with two for late-onset cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression in young adulthood has a stronger hereditary component and is associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts than depression that begins later in life, according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics &lt;/em&gt;by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, among others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that genetic information will be able to help healthcare professionals identify people at high risk of suicide, who may need more support and closer follow-up,” says Lu Yi, senior researcher at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, and one of the study’s corresponding authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a common mental illness that can affect people at different stages of life. The new study shows that depression that begins before the age of 25 has a stronger hereditary component than depression that begins late in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major genetic differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, based on medical records and genetic data from over 150,000 people with depression and 360,000 controls in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, compared genetics and risk of suicide attempts in people who had their first depression before the age of 25 (early onset) and those diagnosed after the age of 50 (late onset).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic differences between the groups were large. The researchers identified twelve genetic regions that were linked to early onset and two regions that were linked to late onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in four people with a high genetic risk of early-onset depression attempted suicide within ten years of diagnosis, which was about twice as many as people with a low genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We show that early-onset depression has partly different genetic causes than depression that affects older individuals and that the risk of suicide attempts is increased,” says Lu Yi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important step towards precision medicine in psychiatry, where treatment and preventive measures are tailored to each individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suicide prevention in healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now plan to investigate how the genetic differences are related to brain development, stress and life experiences, and whether genetic risk profiles can be used in suicide prevention in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is a collaboration between Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, the University of Oslo, Norway, Copenhagen University Hospital and Roskilde University in Denmark, the University of Tartu in Estonia and the Nordic research network TRYGGVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;It has been funded by, among others, the European Research Council (ERC) and the US National Institute of Mental Health. Some of the authors have collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, but none that are related to the current study.

Overall, the two MDD subtypes correlated moderately (genetic correlation, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.58) and differed in their genetic correlations with related traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that eoMDD and loMDD have partially distinct genetic signatures, with a specific developmental brain signature for eoMDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we demonstrate that polygenic risk scores (PRS) for eoMDD predict suicide attempts within the first 10 years after the initial diagnosis: the absolute risk for suicide attempt was 26% in the top PRS decile, compared to 12% and 20% in the bottom decile and the intermediate group, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings can inform precision psychiatry approaches for MDD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:11:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQM3Vtb25mZlc4U1RhNm1Vd2lmcThrMlg5bW80X0xLWkgtakdlYmFhUnlKVmN0ZkNQYnhmejVheTJWN0M2TjJjZEVEUG1zTDRYTkU3Ty03UVJpS3BFWDJoRlJSaDJjc2UtUnBWNHFTOWNzREVXSFpDYU1KWkhwTFNEXw</guid></item><item><title>FDA终止雌激素黑匣子警告-此举可能永远改变更年期护理-女性世界</title><link>https://www.womansworld.com/aging/menopause/how-fda-lifting-black-box-warning-on-estrogen-changes-menopause-care</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-591214 single-format-standard post-how-fda-lifting-black-box-warning-on-estrogen-changes-menopause-care theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eating ultra-processed foods could lead to an increased risk of being diagnosed with precancerous colorectal growths for women under 50, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2841354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published Thursday in JAMA Oncology, looked at health outcomes for 29,105 nurses under 50 who underwent at least one colonoscopy. Participants were followed from June 1991 until June 2015 and filled out questionnaires about their eating habits every four years. The researchers looked at two forms of precancerous polyps: adenomas and serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who had an average of three ultra-processed food servings per day had a 3% risk of a precancerous polyp, while women who had an average of 10 or more ultra-processed food servings per day had a 5% risk, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15370-colon-polyps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but about 75% of colorectal cancers start as these growths. The study did not find any links between ultra-processed foods and serrated lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do see an increase in risk with more servings of ultra-processed food products," said CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline   Gounder, the editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods account for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-calories-ultra-processed-foods-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the average American's diet, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though most dietary guidelines recommend restricting them. Ultra-processed foods have also been linked to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ultra-processed-food-health-issues-cancer-early-death-research/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;dozens of other health issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, including diabetes, sleep issues, heart trouble and early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who ate more ultra-processed foods also had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to have a history of smoking, according to the research. They also tended to have lower levels of physical activity and consume fewer nutrients like fiber and Vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if there are any good ultra-processed foods," Gounder said. "Clearly the more you're eating, the worse for your health, the higher the risk for various complications." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-are-they-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;don't have a set definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but they often include packaged foods and beverages, items made without many whole ingredients, and less obvious products like condiments and sauces. Study participants who had diets higher in sugars and artificial sweeteners, as well as packaged savory snacks, had higher rates of adenoma development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government has said it is planning to define ultra-processed foods, Gounder said. In the meantime, a "good rule of thumb is: if you can't pronounce an ingredient on the package, it is probably an ultra-processed food," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still working to determine exactly how ultra-processed foods affect the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that the ultra-processed foods are changing your microbiome, so those are the bacteria in your gut. So that causes increased inflammation, it can cause increased permeability of the gut wall," Gounder said. "And then secondly, we know ultra-processed foods are associated with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes which we also know increase the risk of various cancers, including perhaps colon cancer." &lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who was at the &lt;b&gt;Taylorsville InstaCare&lt;/b&gt; location at &lt;b&gt;3845 West 4700 South&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt;November 7&lt;/b&gt; between &lt;b&gt;3 p.m. and 7:15 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if those at the InstaCare location did not have direct contact with the infected patient, they remain at risk because measles can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Taylorsville location during the timeframe shared by the health department is being urged to confirm their measles immunity status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday morning, 74 measles infections have been confirmed across the state of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccine recommendations:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children&lt;/b&gt; should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults born before 1957&lt;/b&gt; generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated before 1968&lt;/b&gt; should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963–1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later&lt;/b&gt; are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, healthcare workers, international travelers) should have two doses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Ethiopia on Friday confirmed its first Marburg outbreak after nine cases were identified in a southern region of the country that borders South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the Ethiopian government’s fast action, saying it showed a “commitment to bringing the outbreak under control quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia’s government had reported on Thursday that it was investigating a possible outbreak of an unidentified viral hemorrhagic fever and was lauded by the continental health emergency body, Africa CDC, for its transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO sent a technical team on Thursday to support the East African country in testing and outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO is also providing essential supplies, including personal protective equipment for health workers and infection-prevention supplies, as well as a rapidly deployable isolation tent to bolster clinical care and management capacity,” the U.N. agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak was reported in the southern region of Omo, which borders South Sudan. Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya said Thursday that the outbreak was a concern because “South Sudan isn’t far and has a fragile health system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No other African country has reported Marburg virus cases in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Ebola, the Marburg virus originates in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bedsheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases death from extreme blood loss. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;
