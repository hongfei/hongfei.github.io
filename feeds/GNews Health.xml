&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adopting healthier habits at 40 can help reduce the risk of chronic disease as you age. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians suggest nuts, teff, berries and more to help you get the nutrients you need to age healthfully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy eating pattern provides essential nutrients to prevent or delay age-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blowing out the candles on your 40th birthday is often accompanied by mixed emotions as you turn the corner into midlife. Besides welcoming new wrinkles and gray hairs, turning 40 may have you thinking about your health in a new light. Chronic diseases commonly associated with aging—like cancer, heart disease, and dementia—that once felt they were “a ways off yet” are now top of mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s no magic food that can turn back the clock, adopting healthier habits at 40 can help reduce the risk of chronic disease as you look forward to your 50s, 60s and beyond. We asked dietitians for their top foods to prioritize at 40—here’s what they recommend. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you already use olive oil regularly when cooking, you are off to a great start at maintaining your health beyond 40. Many of the robust health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet are linked to the use of this popular cooking oil.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; has a healthier fat profile than many other oils (or butter) and is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;—plant-based compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tackling inflammation is important since it’s a common denominator in the development of chronic diseases associated with aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, turning 40 is a great time to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adopt habits that may protect your brain&lt;/a&gt; as you age. One recent study found that consuming about ½ tablespoon of olive oil per day reduced the risk of dying from dementia by 28%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are more than just a healthy and convenient snack option; they are linked with numerous health benefits. Snacking often on nuts is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that women who snacked on three servings of nuts per week throughout their midlife were more likely to be “healthy agers” than those who didn’t eat nuts. Walnuts, in particular, were most likely associated with healthier aging in that study.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Dark Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prioritizing dark leafy greens is a simple yet powerful way to invest in long-term health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/sarah-nash?pcrit=GS89VgC-" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Nash M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Leafy greens such as arugula, spinach, kale and Swiss chard are essential after 40 for maintaining cognitive function, heart health and bone strength”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A study found an association between fruit and vegetable consumption and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower rates of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. This may not be entirely novel, but the study also highlighted green leafy vegetables (along with cruciferous and red/orange vegetables) as having the greatest beneficial impact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some of those brain-supporting nutrients in leafy greens include “folate, a key nutrient for brain function, as well as antioxidants that promote heart health and may slow cognitive decline,” says Nash. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding more dark, leafy greens to your plate is a simple strategy to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost bone health&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their vitamin K content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Turning 40 is an important time to prioritize bone health—the earlier you start being proactive about protecting them, the better. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-flaxseeds"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Flaxseeds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A low-effort way to score more fiber and other essential nutrients in your diet after 40 is to add a sprinkle of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-flaxseeds-good-for-you-11733695" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ground flaxseeds&lt;/a&gt; to your oats, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252482/green-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, salads and more. Two tablespoons of flaxseed provide 4 grams of fiber, about 14% of your daily recommended intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like the other foods on this list, it’s a combination of all the unique nutrients in flaxseeds that are responsible for most of the anti-aging benefits. In addition to fiber, “flax seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help to decrease chronic inflammation—something that tends to increase as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://candidlycaitlin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caitlin Ogletree, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. These nutrient-rich seeds may also be particularly helpful for women in their 40s. “Flax seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can help to balance estrogen levels and reduce perimenopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats,” says Ogletree.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-teff"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Teff &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Quinoa, step aside, there’s a new whole grain in town. “Teff is a tiny, gluten-free grain that has been a staple in Ethiopian cuisine for centuries, and it’s gaining popularity worldwide for good reason,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Why should you give this whole grain a try? For starters, research has found that folks who regularly consume more whole grains in mid-life enjoy longer lives with more disease-free years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because whole grains, like teff, are rich in dietary fiber, which helps promote healthy digestion and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supports heart health&lt;/a&gt; per Manaker. Since heart disease remains the number one cause of death for both men and women in the U.S, adding more heart-healthy foods to your diet at 40 can keep your ticker in top top shape.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-strained-greek-style-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Strained (Greek-style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your gut microbiome plays a critical role in reducing your risk of chronic disease as you age, making 40 an ideal time to start optimizing your gut health. Strained (Greek-style) yogurt is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/probiotic-rich-foods-that-are-not-yogurt-11794516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in probiotics&lt;/a&gt; and other nutrients that can help beneficial gut bacteria thrive. Research has found that those who thrived in older age were more likely to have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;more diverse gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, with a higher ratio of good-to-bad strains of bacteria, compared to those with numerous health conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching for strained (Greek-style) yogurt versus conventional yogurt also helps you get more protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prioritizing protein in your diet&lt;/a&gt; can help minimize some of the muscle loss that persists after 40.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yogurt is also a good source of another under-the-radar nutrient called choline, which research has linked to better brain health later in life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You probably don’t need much convincing to include more flavorful berries in your diet. These juicy, bite-sized fruits are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in the antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; needed to tackle the oxidative stress and inflammation that put you at increased risk of age-related disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, regularly enjoying berries has been shown to protect your brain against the negative effects of aging and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So stock up on both fresh and frozen berries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for one food that can boost both your heart and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-protein-for-better-brain-health-8686324" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, fatty fish is our top pick. As we mentioned before, it’s important to start prioritizing your protein intake at 40 to temper the muscle loss that naturally occurs with aging, and fatty fish are a great option. One study found that when individuals over 50 years of age consumed about 5 ounces of fish for lunch twice a week for 10 weeks, they lost less muscle mass than those who didn’t have fish.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides protein, fatty fish like salmon, trout and mackerel are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, “which aid in heart and brain health and help reduce inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://thehomecookingdietitian.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carrie Gabriel, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. For women in their 40s, those omega-3 fats are also helpful for hormone balance and reducing the severity of symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause, per Gabriel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While aging is inevitable, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adopting healthier habits will help&lt;/a&gt; you thrive as you grow older. Turning 40 is a great time to start thinking about your health into your 50s, 60s and beyond. Prioritizing a healthy eating pattern will provide your body with the essential nutrients it needs to prevent or at least delay age-related diseases. Dietitians recommend filling your plate with foods like fatty fish, flaxseeds, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, olive oil, berries and more to make sure you get the right nutrients to age more healthfully.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you picture a pelvic bone, there are many places you can have pain that might or might not be your hips. So first try to figure out if you actually have hip pain or if it’s stemming from something else. For example, back and hip pain commonly occur together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The central issue is that not all hip pain is clearly from the hip. What&lt;br&gt;we typically think about as hip pain, or pain that is located on the side of the hip, may in fact be coming from the hip, the muscles around the hip or joints next to the hip, including the lower back area and SI [sacroiliac] joint,” said &lt;a href="https://rahulshahmd.com/about/dr-shah" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Rahul Shah&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically you can identify hip pain if a deep flexion hurts, like when you’re doing something more intense, like a &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/dumbbell-goblet-squat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;goblet squat&lt;/a&gt;, Ochiai said. You could also just experience general pain when you’re sitting if you happen to flex your hip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have really deep chairs, where the knees come up to the level of the waist, then say they can’t get through the workday because it’s hard to sit that long,” he explained. “A quick fix is either raise your chair and sit forward on the chair so you don’t hyperflex your hip, or get a pillow or cushion and sit on that to raise your legs up higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other signs include “difficulty standing on the affected leg, difficulty with putting on socks or shoes and difficulty with clipping toenails,” Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochiai also said that there’s a hack, or “quick and dirty way,” to see if you might have a hip issue: “Lay on your back and grab the front of your knee with both hands, and pull that knee towards your chest. Then have someone take a picture of how close you got your knee to your chest. Then do it again on the other side. If there’s a marked difference, that’s not just tight muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga, Pilates, strengthening exercises and anything that improves your abdominal strength can help your hip, Ochiai said. His rehab protocols for post-hip surgery patients involve ab and back exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hip and back issues go together like peanut butter and jelly, so improving back strength can unload and actually improve your hip pain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening your glute muscles is also key to improving hip pain. Ochiai recommended performing exercises like hamstring stretches (such as touching your toes) and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a39110810/how-to-do-bodyweight-squats/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;bodyweight squats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t underestimate the power of stretching. Shah said &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/fitness-hip-flexor-stretches" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;hip flexor stretches&lt;/a&gt;, along with knee and ankle mobility stretches, can help achieve a full, painless range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These methods, in combination with visiting a doctor for a more thorough evaluation, will have your hips thanking you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hip-pain-doctor-advice_l_667d68b4e4b05521a7f0f37b" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, the bacteria become plentiful in brackish seas and rivers, where freshwater bodies merge with saltwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Infections typically occur in one of two ways: through the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, or when warm, low-salinity water enters an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CNN noted that vibriosis has long been associated with the Gulf Coast, but in recent years, cases have occurred further north on the East Coast.

The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s automatic responses to images the person sees before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to prevent them doing their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Before the test, volunteers were shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture was one of the eight they had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94264b9-b7a6-4f78-a3b3-bd50aa5dcdf9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr George Stothart from the University of Bath with John Stennard, one of the 54 healthy adults involved in the trial.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: BRACE Dementia Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists found that those with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test cannot identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the tests were performed in people’s homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step, he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time. Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQVHpoemJ1SGxEUGZzaHRSdU5JS3kzaU54UkVlZEhpVGZhTjVNZ2VKZ0pvN2VDNG5uNFpCRDJlR3ZZTi1ZRjBuTVkzMk9MM1JqU1BCR29uNllaXzFTcWt3VW55UFBXVEVKQ1p0NUFXSVBjeXM4a2k3Uy1mckNxWWZObUc2bGhRZFI4Sm8yZU1GTi1xQlVXR3QtNFZLV2tCanVFU1ZjRWtJc0tsUS1aU3d6bUptQXVVblVZQUpzMVcwMHRtWUR1ek1lTA</guid></item><item><title>女性心力衰竭：关键危险因素及预防方法- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjums00xcll</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Heart failure in women: Key risk factors and how to prevent them&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Heart failure in women stems from a mix of traditional risks like hypertension and obesity, and sex-specific factors including hormonal changes, reproductive history and chronic inflammation; early prevention and awareness are key to reducing future heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 22:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE16Q0NMdDk1YzFaY3dqUmxYZ1k2Yl9yMXU3dUJhLTRPM01pNkJOVGF0OTM3c2FKaEpibWM5UnlybWkyWnFHdEFTcU5Qc2FxXzJVTURKSk9RME5wRFpvRDgzUkxRMzJTQVAtaVFn</guid></item><item><title>研究检测全球月经产品中的有毒PFAS化学物质- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/study-detects-toxic-pfas-forever-chemicals-in-menstrual-products-available-worldwide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable menstrual products are meant to be the safer, greener option. A new, peer-reviewed study finds, however, that this is not always the case. Researchers found PFAS, also known as “&lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;” because of their persistence, in a range of period items and incontinence products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in various industrial and consumer products since the 1940s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are known endocrine disruptors, and the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt; links certain exposures to decreased fertility, some cancers, high cholesterol, and hormone effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-in-menstrual-products"&gt;PFAS in menstrual products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes from Graham Peaslee at the &lt;a href="https://www.nd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;. His team and collaborators screened 59 reusable products across categories, then ran targeted tests on a subset to identify specific compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual products, including underwear and reusable pads, showed the highest rates of intentional PFAS use, at 33 percent and 25 percent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS were detected in all extracted products, and the most abundant &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-plastic-food-packaging-contains-9936-harmful-chemicals/"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; were fluorotelomer alcohols 6:2 and 8:2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS come in ionic and neutral forms. Neutral PFAS lack an electrical charge, which can change how they move through materials and the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling work indicates several neutral PFAS may be absorbed through skin efficiently. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36917694/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; estimated dermal uptake for 11 neutral PFAS could exceed inhalation under certain indoor scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-found"&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team first used a rapid screen for total fluorine to spot possible intentional use. They then measured the levels of 31 ionic and 11 neutral compounds in selected items to see what was actually present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern was consistent across markets sampled from North America, South America, and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one product in every category tested showed no signs of intentional fluorination, which suggests it is possible to manufacture these items without using PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-free-menstrual-products"&gt;PFAS-free menstrual products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only a subset of the products had high levels of PFAS present, which means that PFAS must not be essential in the manufacture of reusable feminine hygiene products,” said Alyssa Wicks, the lead author and a postdoctoral assistant at &lt;a href="https://duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding matters because it shows menstrual products can be manufactured successfully without these treatments. It also means product design choices, suppliers, and coatings make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin is not an absolute barrier. The outer layer is lipid rich, and neutral compounds can partition into it, which raises reasonable concerns for long wear items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutral PFAS may also contact mucous membranes depending on the product. Data on long term uptake through vaginal tissue remain limited, so risk assessments are still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-environmental-health-implications"&gt;Environmental health implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS in menstrual products do not stay confined to the user. When these items are washed, particles and residues can move into household wastewater, which eventually connects to larger water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater plants are not designed to filter PFAS, so the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-threaten-arctic-wildlife-and-human-health/"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; can pass through treatment and return to rivers, lakes, and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the environment, PFAS can accumulate in fish and other wildlife. Studies have shown measurable levels in species that people eat, which means contamination cycles back into the food chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection links individual product use to a wider public health issue that affects whole communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-lower-pfas-exposure-today"&gt;How to lower PFAS exposure today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking water is a major route for many communities. For households on contaminated systems or wells, certified home &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanups/reducing-pfas-your-drinking-water-home-filter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt; can reduce several PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For textiles and period products, prefer options without stain or water repellence treatments. Choose brands that publish PFAS test reports for current lots, not just historical claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA set the first national drinking water &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/pfas-npdwr_fact-sheet_general_4.9.24v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; for several PFAS in April 2024. Utilities have a schedule to monitor and reduce levels, and states are aligning plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now filling key gaps on dermal absorption of neutral PFAS and on product to body transfer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardized labeling and supplier auditing will help manufacturers avoid these chemicals while maintaining leak protection and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-still-do-not-know"&gt;What we still do not know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not yet know the real world dose that is obtained from wearing PFAS-treated textiles against skin. Laboratory models and screening data point to plausible exposure, but time on body, temperature, fabric structure, and wash history all matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also do not know how neutral PFAS absorbed via this route convert or persist once &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-dietary-fiber-supplement-could-remove-pfas-forever-chemicals-from-the-body/"&gt;inside the body&lt;/a&gt;. Targeted biomonitoring paired with product testing will be needed to answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s snapshot is small but informative. It shows both the problem and the potential path forward. Reusable designs can work without PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers can reward brands that disclose materials and publish independent testing, and makers can tighten supply chains to keep fluorinated treatments out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbW96NmVSYzVrQ05yWmtwWjRVTDE2M0xWOUFzdkJPd3RoYTl0UnBlUm9Fdk5TZ0hyWVlJX1hJVnNkY3lfVlducFhYN1B3M2hjX0dYbjd3RVFzczlXX1FLSDdYRnFPSDd1VHNYWW1yNWlVRmFwdUJ2QjZ4VXhFRFVPTlVpN25hcEh6Y3p6S0d1VU0xNWZIWVhkanBkLUU2dkZuSDF4TW5RTi1jTHVUX2xYTnF3</guid></item><item><title>诊断软件使中风患者的完全康复率提高三倍-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/diagnostic-software-stroke-patients-ai-hghmzxs0s</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Half of stroke patients can now “fully recover” after the NHS introduced “revolutionary” software that allows patients to receive a diagnosis up to one hour faster compared with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Analysis from NHS England has found that the specialised AI-assisted tool has been used to interpret the brain scans of more than 60,000 patients since the roll-out last summer, as half of stroke patients now receive a diagnosis from the software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The service, available in 100 &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; stroke clinics, allows for rapid processing and interpretation of brain scans, which helps doctors to make faster decisions about treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="6afd3834-a856-4c97-81b9-b9b611780b88"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is cut off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The improved scans mean that patients can now get a diagnosis up to an hour faster than when they are diagnosed with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During a stroke, the&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; blood supply to parts of the brain is blocked or reduced, causing the brain cells to die.

This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes the prebiotic harnessed the gut-brain axis and promoted the growth of good bacteria in the intestines that reduced inflammation in the brain and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14607151/scientists-debunked-theory-cause-autism-study.html"&gt;'gut-brain axis',&lt;/a&gt; a network linking the digestive tract and the nervous system and brain, has been thought to be a key link between digestion and mental health for years, with some scientists claiming that the trillions of microbes in the intestines may influence mood, behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conducting the study in twins reduced the chances the changes observed were because of genetics, but the study was small, and scientists said it needs to be repeated in a larger group in order to support its findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study has found that two common supplements could help prevent dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic say the gut-brain axis explains everyday sensations such as 'gut feelings' or 'butterflies' in the stomach, and others suggest a balanced microbiome, or community of bacteria in the intestines, can boost brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are even suggestions an unbalanced microbiome in the gut could be linked to a higher risk of autism in children, and a higher risk of depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet many experts caution that much of the research up to this point remains preliminary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, scientists gave all participants the protein powder BCAA, sold for about 70 cents a capsule and a common supplement used to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the participants also received the prebiotic inulin, a type of fiber from roots, plus fructooligosaccharides, a type of carbohydrate found in plants and sometimes used as a low-calorie sweetener. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic supplements are readily available online and in retailers and cost about $3 a pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twins who received both the powder and prebiotic scored better on Paired Associates Learning (PAL) tests, or tests that involve matching similar images used to help recognize early signs of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests on stool samples revealed twins who received the prebiotic had higher levels of Bifidobacterium in their gut compared to those not taking the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bifidobacterium are healthy bacteria shown to boost the body's immune system, improve digestion and even potentially help those struggling with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote in their study: 'Our results demonstrate that cheap and readily available gut microbiome interventions may improve cognition in our ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To confirm our findings, a larger study which includes a range of cognitive tests, alongside measures of effect and attention, and detailed microbiome measures is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said their findings would only apply to healthy adults and not to those who had already developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at Johns Hopkins say that there is a 'second brain' in the gut, or the enteric nervous system, formed of two thin layers of more than 100million nerve cells that line the gastrointestinal tract from the throat to the rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells do not 'think' like in the brain, primarily being involved in digestion and the release of enzymes to break down food, but there is evidence that they send signals back to the brain that can trigger shifts in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have already linked this to shifts in mood in those with irritable bowel disease, a chronic bowel pain disorder, and caused by constipation or diarrhea.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition that gradually robs sufferers of their abilities to take care of themselves, speak and remember events and people in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of Americans suffering from the condition is expected to surge, according to some estimates, and jump to almost 13million by 2050, nearly double today's patient figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include forgetting names or familiar objects, becoming lost in familiar places or unexplained changes in emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the condition, but scientists have developed medications that may be able to slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cause of Alzheimer's is not clear, but studies suggest it may be linked to a build-up of proteins in the brain, or to damage to blood vessels in the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of the study, researchers also investigated whether the supplements influenced muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists suggest that the regulation of muscle growth may be controlled by key signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were asked to also complete a weight-lifting session twice per week, and do exercises including squats, calf raises and bicep curls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed no difference in muscle mass or chair rise times, the time it takes someone to get up from a chair, at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers suggested this may have been because the study was too short to show any shifts in muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The new AI stethoscope can diagnose three heart conditions—Heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and valvular heart disease (VHD)—in just 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the traditional stethoscope listens to sounds inside the body, like a heartbeat or breathing, the AI-powered stethoscope goes further than that and can pick up on tiny changes in the heartbeat or blood flow that a human ear would miss. Meanwhile, it can also perform a quick ECG (electrocardiogram) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new device, which is the size of a playing card, has been showcased by researchers at Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust as part of a study in the UK called TRICORDER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device can also connect via Bluetooth to a dedicated smartphone app where the captured data can be visualized. Meanwhile, it uses cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity to access cloud-based AI algorithms to work its magic. These algorithms are managed by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and are said to show promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The statistical performance of these three AI algorithms has been shown to be high and consistent against international external validation studies,” authors of the research paper wrote in the BMJ Open journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-10" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does the AI stethoscope work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI stethoscope is placed on the chest of a patient to take an ECG recording of the electrical signals from their heart while its microphone records the sound of their blood flowing through the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-11" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information is then sent to the cloud to be analyzed by the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-s-xai-accuses-former-engineer-xuechen-li-of-alleged-theft-of-ai-trade-secrets-openai-11756725484941.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="AI"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; algorithms that have been trained on health data from tens of thousands of people and can detect subtle heart problems that a human may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-12" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test result, which indicates whether the patient is flagged as at risk for heart failure or not, is then sent straight back to the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-13" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Heart Foundation, which partly funded the study, states that people examined using the AI stethoscopes were “2.33 times more likely to be diagnosed with heart failure, 3.45 times more likely to be diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and 1.92 times more likely to be diagnosed with heart valve disease in the next 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Mint</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:40:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>高中结核病感染提示对可能的暴露进行调查- WWMT</title><link>https://wwmt.com/news/arc/coldwater-high-school-tuberculosis-infection-sickness-possible-exposures-investigation-branch-hillsdale-st-joseph-community-health-agency-western-michigan</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;COLDWATER, Mich.  — &lt;/span&gt;A high school tuberculosis (TB) infection was confirmed Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Coldwater High School (CHS) parents and staff, Coldwater Community Schools (CCS) and Branch-Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency (BHSJCHA ) officials confirmed a person affiliated with CHS has TB and is undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter did not detail any additional information about the confirmed case, however, did say an investigation was initiated after BHSJCHA was notified and they are working to identify people from the 2024-2025 spring semester who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have been exposed will receive a notification with recommendations for testing, at no cost through BHSJCHA,  and a health questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We understand this news may raise concerns, but please know although active TB can be a serious disease, it is a treatable condition," CCS and BHSJCHA officials said in the letter. "TB outbreaks are also uncommon in United States school settings. In any case, please note we are committed to both an individual’s right to privacy and protecting the health of all students and staff." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB is an airborne disease that typically affects the lungs but can also impact the brain, kidneys or the spine. Spending extended time in an enclosed space with someone infected is "required for TB to spread between people," according to BHSJCHA. While it is contagious, it's less so than the flu or a cold, and cannot be transferred through  shaking someone’s hand, sharing food or drink, sharing toothbrushes, sharing school supplies, kissing, touching bed linens or touching toilet seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following safety recommendations were made to the CHS community: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain, among others. These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your child have these symptoms, contact your doctor and BHSJCHA team using the information below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for further CHS and BHSJCHA communications. If you or your child is identified as being exposed to TB, be ready to complete a consent form for evaluation and testing, as well as receive notification for where and when evaluation and testing will occur.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 2021, the United States experienced a nearly 30 year decline in TB cases, including a large decline in 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recovery from pandemic-related health care disruptions, increases in post-pandemic travel and outbreaks in several states have "likely contributed" to recent upward TB trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Provisional CDC data from 2024&lt;/a&gt; shows an 8% increase in TB cases nationally from 2023 (9,622 cases in 2023 and 10,347 cases in 2024) as well as an 11% increase in Michigan (149 in 2023 and 165 in 2024). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about TB can be found &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/site.html#gen" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/site.html#gen" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:26:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxNRGpzQ1drTUc1d0E3WkxPaVhNSzc5SGlBcEZrNkp0Y0RPY1BqVnJTU25XUDVmaklDclV4M3ZDYlN3QkJtVU5LdF9PdE5iYXNfSVZ2YWJBN1VTOC05dEpPVUxpUDM2WGw2dkZVZkZuUTkweUYzazhqSGtIa1plSU5fYXJJbjcxRURtWHA5X0xEdWNfUl9ybGRwQ2t1R1M3ZVY5THFrWkFQbnozQlhtWk92UGxBV2N0bkdpeTlkSWttME1wZHB0X1VOUWFMdW5BWjJvSE9MZEt4UDlucWxaRWozNTVxX0lSN2k3cy1vWWpjMkxRMFFLb1p0cDZJUlEwRHJWM1A2QzkxVGpxNjlX</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症会破坏避免不愉快事件的学习-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/depression-learning-avoidance-29648/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Depression specifically impairs the ability to learn how to actively avoid unpleasant events, though it does not affect avoidance behavior once learned. Researchers tested 465 participants across a range of depressive symptoms in a task adapted from rodent research, involving sounds and visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with more severe symptoms had difficulty at the learning stage but eventually performed at the same level as others once they acquired the skill. The findings suggest depression may uniquely affect the acquisition of avoidance learning rather than avoidance itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Impairment:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression interferes with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Catches Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Once tasks are learned, depressed individuals perform as well as others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers aim to test how depression affects avoidance in complex or long-term contexts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression alters how people pursue rewards, but, conversely, whether depressive symptoms influence how people learn to avoid nonrewarding, unpleasant events is less clear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Tomm and colleagues, from the University of British Colombia, addressed this question in their &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt; paper to shed more light on the relationship between depression and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work brought together researchers from preclinical, cognitive, and clinical backgrounds, building stronger connections across fields to better understand the mechanisms of depression.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a behavioral task for study volunteers based off rodent research that involves participants listening to sounds while looking at a screen with visual cues signaling sounds to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants learned to avoid unpleasant sounds either by actively responding or withholding responses to cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a sample of 465 participants with a wide range of depressive symptoms from low to severe, the researchers found that people with more severe symptoms struggled to learn to actively avoid aversive sounds compared to those with less severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once they did learn the task, their ability to actively avoid unpleasant sounds matched those with less symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to the authors, depressive symptoms may interfere specifically with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events, rather than with avoidance more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we still don’t know,” says Tomm, “is how depressive symptoms affect avoidance when people continue to learn after being proficient at an avoidance task, or in more complex situations where the best way to avoid something is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we actively explore these questions, we hope our work will provide a deeper understanding of how depression shapes avoidance behavior across different contexts.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0ada5a4a9a180b3a6aeeeafb2a7ada5a4a9a180b3a6aeeeafb2a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Antibiotics are great, they are miracles in severe bacterial infections where they can be life-saving,' Dr. Van Groningen explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know that antibiotic use is the number one factor for developing C.diff, or C. difficile infections, which can be absolutely terrible if you have seen or heard or read about these,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;C. diff is a type of bacteria that infects your colon, per &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15548-c-diff-infection"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and is extremely contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr. Van Groningen said that even if you don't develop C.diff from antibiotic use, it can heavily interfere with your gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In fact, there are a couple of recent studies that have shown that antibiotic use has been associated with a modest &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7377039/Some-antibiotics-linked-higher-risk-colon-cancer.html"&gt;increased risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,' Dr. Van Groningen said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is postulated that one of the possible causative explanations for this could be the alteration in gut microbiome that comes along with antibiotic use,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Again, great drug for the right purpose, but I wouldn't use it just because.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another great example of a fantastic medication used in the acute setting for an allergic reaction, a rash, can be fantastic, but it is not meant to be used in the long term,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cited that there have been a few studies that found a link between long-term &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14918501/benadryl-crippling-disease-warning.html"&gt;Benadryl use and dementia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Plus, the long list of side effects, especially in older adults, can be quite burdensome,' she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the side effects that the doctor named were sedation, constipation, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just not great as a long-term option,' she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is not something that I think we should be doing when we have time, it is the cornerstone of our health,' she stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9491791/Lack-SLEEP-increase-risk-dementia-study-finds.html"&gt;so many different studies&lt;/a&gt; that link chronic sleep deprivation with an increased risk of a multitude of chronic diseases, everything from dementia to cardiovascular disease,' the doctor shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that on a long-term basis, it's important to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:05:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQNmdTdmp3VkhEX1hVQnZ6OVZ5NUFfQzY1YURrQnRLQlY2VndXdEZDOEZJSUhfek4tcE1rUkNHSFFLb1BkZ0ZUQkY2Y1VZX2ZXbUk4MGRpZ2dBaExQODd1MnBLNEZiRUdsb0FncTNuQjNiMk9Ha0I2RXF1Wk9lRDI1UGZqeWRlSTRqM0V2c0VxaUlEUDN3Wng1RtIBngFBVV95cUxOMUd0eldDeUtaZHoxMEEzZy1oZXc4TTc2THMzY2Z2QjRQQU56QkVkb2UwcFFSamZQTXBnUWlSeDlNeXkycFlOQ1p6cmxRWkRlN1hzci1fNlVOajctR3hzbXM5U3piZDJUbDNNYkZJTG1YVmFtM2VPZUdTNjNPQUJfYXdkMkhSNUU0czNDX0pfLUszMExveXdkN3k4dDcwQQ</guid></item><item><title>学生重返校园时对纽约疫苗的了解- Gothamist</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/what-to-know-about-vaccines-in-ny-as-students-go-back-to-school</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="60381"&gt;Back-to-school checklists for many parents include backpacks, notebooks — and making sure their kids are up to date on their vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="44ubo"&gt;Even amid &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/11/vaccines-measles-rfk-jr-health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mixed messaging&lt;/a&gt;

Meanwhile, flu shots have been on the decline in recent years, even as public health officials have urged immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a8m2l"&gt;This fall, New York’s health officials and doctors are tasked with keeping immunization rates high and reassuring parents about vaccine safety as a shakeup in federal vaccine policies threatens to sow confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="615n6"&gt;Some doctors in New York City are also anecdotally &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/12/ice-fear-undocumented-immigrant-medical-services-nyccare/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reporting higher no-show rates&lt;/a&gt; for medical appointments among immigrant patients amid broad fears about ramped up federal immigration enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="88tva"&gt;Dr. Jessica Sessions, a pediatrician and medical director for the Ryan Chelsea-Clinton Community Health Center in Manhattan, said parents should feel comfortable “ just opening up and letting your doctor know if you do have worries or concerns” about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5tbon"&gt;“ We're happy to help you navigate through them,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1p1k3"&gt;Doctors like Sessions are also figuring out how to navigate a changing federal vaccine landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fb8l5"&gt;This summer, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1960742897201872969" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said on X&lt;/a&gt; that the shots will remain available to all who want them after consulting with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fd4s9"&gt;But the new guidance represents a growing rift between the federal government and professional medical groups when it comes to vaccine recommendations, and how doctors respond may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bd64o"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/3/e2022058700/188297/?_gl=1*1sdvz7s*_ga*MTM3ODc0NzkxMi4xNzU2MzIwNTM0*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTY2NTEzODQkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTY2NTMxNDgkajUxJGwwJGgw*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTY2NTEzODUuQ2owS0NRanc1Y19GQmhESkFSSXNBSWNtSEs5dHk2TzFDVW1VZnlDSHBOaHZ5VjdEb0lURENFVVhZOUFyRXBRTTNNSWdsSkFYUW1VQUJ4c2FBbk1CRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTE5NDA3NDc0NS4xNzU2NjUxMzg0*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTY2NTEzODQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTY2NTMxNDgkajYwJGwwJGgw" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommends COVID shots&lt;/a&gt; for children over six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bie7h"&gt;COVID vaccines are not required for kids to attend school in New York, but Sessions said some parents still ask about them.

Students need to get immunized against preventable diseases like measles, chicken pox, whooping cough and polio, depending on what grade they’re entering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="357km"&gt;Students in public, private and religious schools have to show proof they’ve gotten all the shots required for their age groups within 14 days of the start of school or day care each fall, unless they can show they have medical exemptions. Students arriving from outside of the state or country can be given grace periods of up to 30 days, according to &lt;a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/guidance-to-schools-on-immunization-compliance.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guidance to schools&lt;/a&gt; from the New York City Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6hgg6"&gt;“Vaccination is an important part of keeping our schools healthy, and vaccination guidance has been distributed to families," said Jenna Lyle, a spokesperson for the city education department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5gk4q"&gt;New York state has &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;among the strictest&lt;/a&gt; school vaccination laws in the country, since former Gov. Andrew Cuomo eliminated the option of religious exemptions for vaccination in 2019 following a major measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="45gmm"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do New York kindergartners compare to the rest of the country on vaccine coverage?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7t8c0"&gt;During the last school year, vaccine coverage among kindergartners &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;decreased nationally&lt;/a&gt; for all vaccines tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, the agency found that the share of kindergartners claiming exemptions increased in most states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7e4ub"&gt;However, the data shows New York’s vaccine coverage remained among the strongest in the country, largely because kindergartners were not taking advantage of vaccine exemptions at the rates they were in many other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3hr36"&gt;In New York, 97.8% of kindergartners received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, above the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. Statewide, 0.3% of kindergartners claimed any vaccine exemption last school year, up from 0.1% the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="9ns8r"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about vaccination rates among younger kids?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d8bmo"&gt;City data on vaccine coverage among 2-year-olds shows rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/childhood-vaccination-data.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trending upward&lt;/a&gt; in recent years for most types of shots, although uptake for some vaccines is better than others — and rates can vary widely by neighborhood. Citywide, 95% of 2-year-olds had gotten at least one dose of their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines last year, up from 87% in 2020. But in parts of the city, the rate remains low. In the Central Harlem ZIP code 10039, just 58% of 2-year-olds got at least one dose of the MMR vaccine last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9pl9t"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department, said routine medical care was disrupted during the pandemic, negatively affecting vaccination rates, and the increase in overall vaccination rates among young children indicates a reversal of that trend. She said the city is also working to share and discuss vaccination rates with individual health care providers to improve coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cn9sf"&gt;Citywide, vaccination against the flu has declined among all children under 18 in recent years, city data shows. The flu vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/immunizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only required&lt;/a&gt; in the city for children attending pre-K or day care, according to guidance from the city Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="c9knl"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could federal policy changes influence New York’s school vaccine requirements?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cklhb"&gt;Federal public health changes have stirred up some uncertainty about the future. New York state bases its school vaccine requirements on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f20oh"&gt;Kennedy’s recent overhaul of the committee has prompted concerns about whether members will continue to base their recommendations in science, and some professional medical groups &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-acog-recommendations" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have started issuing&lt;/a&gt; their own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="aeiv3"&gt;“Should changes to ACIP’s composition lead to substantial shifts in its recommendations, the department will carefully evaluate those changes and assess any implications for public health policy in New York,” Dr. James McDonald, the state health commissioner, told Gothamist in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ar9gr"&gt;Danielle DeSouza, a spokesperson for the state health department, said last week the agency continues to monitor federal vaccine messaging and recommendations and “do what is best to protect public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="42e6s"&gt;Sessions said pediatricians are “really following American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations right now, and we're looking to them as sort of our guiding light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ckfo6"&gt;But health care providers say challenges could arise if future changes in vaccine recommendations affect which shots are covered by insurance or provided to doctors by the federal Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines at no cost to eligible kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="19ktj"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will flu shots be available as usual this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4h1fn"&gt;ACIP raised some eyebrows among medical groups when it &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-recommends-flu-vaccines-thimerosal/story?id=123224218" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advised against&lt;/a&gt; formulations of the flu vaccine that contain a preservative known as thimerosal in June. But doctors who spoke to Gothamist said they didn’t anticipate any challenge getting flu shots without the preservative and said it wouldn’t lead to any meaningful change for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="62vti"&gt;Some health care providers in New York are already starting to get in their supply of this year’s flu vaccine, while others expect the vaccine to come in soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNbDhIUzNfZ01BcGVQd3BQR01kTTQtUm9HOFljcXRla3JDV2JGRENPNXRXVVQyT2RWZ3c0RGx6NXRRM25rcnB4Umh2NkZ6QmZtamdJRWpkaE9UeDdKc3E5Rnp5V2NyYnVHTW54bVRYSG1BTE1EcE14TkxmZU5jT29lMUNVVTNaX2dpcXBJZUx4UEg4cEJF</guid></item><item><title>医生说，电子烟可能会对儿童健康造成不可逆转的伤害-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors have raised the alarm about high levels of vaping among children worldwide, saying they are convinced e-cigarettes are causing irreversible harm to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;contentType&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Article&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sectionId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/e-cigarettes&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Vaping&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/smoking&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Smoking&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/childrens-health&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Children's health&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/health&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Health&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/society&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Society&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;world/world&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;World news&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;type/article&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Article&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;tone/news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tone&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;News&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;profile/andrew-gregory&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Andrew Gregory&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tracking&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;UK Home News&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;isPaidContent&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;isPreview&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;host&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;pageId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://profile.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;contributionsServiceUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://contributions.guardianapis.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;editionId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;US&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nicotine levels in e-cigarettes can be very high, raising the risk of addiction and injury to the developing brains of adolescents. Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Speaking at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that millions of children could face ill health in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said: “I worry that vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become more stiff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said. Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Løchen cited a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When e-cigarettes heat liquids to higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also know that when children and young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk of irreversible harm to their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that. It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to cardiovascular risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a moment too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data on the long-term health effects is limited because vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban on sales of e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think based on what we know now about the detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15, 20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQR09udWVWT005WUJ1NUw2VmVTeU5RNnpCV0FUM2Rvb1JNb01rd2lrLWtCSDFSVDU5M1Rac3JMX0FGb0NBUDBCV3dBcl9VVDlZU3MtV1hYZ2l0OXNCa21yYkNOS0lQd0pPQ1dYelNNOUZCR2hDb1pHOW5DeHJIUE5fU3dja0tITmdsZHNacEhRVTdJXzl3M19zYVJ5VlZhZkVRYWFIOEJ4X2txczFuZjlZaA</guid></item><item><title>可以偷走阿司匹林冠冕的预防心脏病发作的药物-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/the-heart-attack-preventing-drug-that-could-steal-aspirins-crown-fwxsbkrb7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aspirin has been one of the most widely used medicines around the world for more than a century, most recently in low-dose form as a treatment for cardiovascular problems such as a heart attack or a stroke. However, its reign has been challenged by more recent drugs, and new research published in The Lancet could see it &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;lose its crown to a younger pretender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers analysing clinical trials involving nearly 30,000 people with coronary artery disease — which can include those who’ve had a heart attack or suffer from angina — found that a low dose of aspirin doesn’t offer as much protection as the newer antiplatelet (blood-thinning) drug clopidogrel. A finding that could change UK guidelines which, at least for most people with&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; coronary artery disease, advocate taking a daily aspirin for the rest of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel may be the newer of the two drugs but it has been in use since the late Nineties and is the medicine of choice for preventing recurrent problems in most people who have had a stroke, or who have “furred-up” arteries in their legs. However, aspirin remains the standard long-term preventive for people with coronary artery disease. For now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both medicines work by reducing the stickiness of platelets, the smallest components of blood that clump together after injury to help to form clots and stem bleeding. A potentially life-saving physiological response if you are involved in a road traffic accident or undergoing surgery, but a potentially fatal one if the platelets happen to be activated in a narrow blood vessel supplying your heart or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The use of antiplatelet medicines took off in the UK after the publication in 1988 of the landmark ISIS-2 trial, which found that daily low-dose aspirin was a life-saver for people who had a heart attack. It indicated that one month of taking the drug prevented 25 deaths, and another 10-15 non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, for every 1,000 people. And the longer they took the aspirin the greater the benefit. It was game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel was licensed about a decade after the ISIS-2 trial and was initially mainly used as a substitute for people who couldn’t take aspirin. It has a different mechanism of action (see below) but the net effect — reduced platelet “stickiness” — is much the same. Indeed, these days the drugs are often used together, at least in the short to medium term, after a heart attack, coronary artery bypass surgery, stenting and heart valve surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, as well as preventing unwanted clots in arterial bottlenecks the drugs can prevent useful clots and lead to troublesome bleeding: anything from bruising after a trivial knock or shaving nicks that won’t stop oozing to life-threatening haemorrhage in some cases. Reassuringly the Lancet paper shows that while clopidogrel is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks (and strokes) in most people with coronary artery disease, it carries no extra risk of these types of dangerous bleeding. It is often the preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switching aspirin for alternative drug ‘reduces risk of heart attack’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If, as expected, guidance is changed to favour clopidogrel, millions more will end up on the drug (more than a third of people over 65 in the UK take a daily low-dose aspirin at present), but there are a couple of flies in the ointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;First, a person’s response to clopidogrel can be affected by their genetic make up, with about 30 per cent of those with European ancestry (and 50 per cent of those with east Asian ancestry) having genes that render the drug less effective. However, the researchers behind the Lancet study concluded that while it may reduce efficacy in acute treatment, such as in the days or weeks after developing heart problems, there is less evidence that it significantly impairs longer-term prevention for most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Second, the commonly prescribed anti-stomach acid medication omeprazole, and its sister drug esomeprazole, can reduce clopidogrel’s efficacy. The latest evidence suggests this may not be as worrying as initially thought, but the combination is still best avoided. Lansoprazole, another popular member of the same family of acid-suppressing drugs, is deemed a safer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Unlike aspirin, clopidogrel is prescription-only, so people will not be able to self-medicate. Fewer people self-treat with daily low-dose aspirin than used to, but I still come across healthy middle-aged people who buy it over the counter to ward off an early heart attack or stroke. However, the evidence is clear: if you are not at higher than normal risk of stroke or heart attack, the risks of aspirin (mainly bleeding) are likely to outweigh the benefits. Take an antiplatelet medicine only if advised to do so by your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oh, and it is clo-pid-o-grill. At least that’s how I pronounce it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/mi-secondary-prevention/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;cks.nice.org.uk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; for more information on how people who have already had one can prevent further heart attacks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How aspirin and clopidogrel work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aspirin irreversibly blocks an enzyme in platelets that encourages them to clump and stick together (a natural part of the clotting process). This effect lasts for the whole seven to ten-day life of the platelets and wanes only when they are replaced by new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel binds to a receptor on the surface of platelets (called P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate) but the result is much the same. And, like aspirin, the inhibition is irreversible and lasts the life of the platelet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other antiplatelet drugs include ticagrelor, prasugrel and dipyridamole.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These ultra-processed food markers can often be found in breads, biscuits, crisps and cakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nevertheless, previous studies have linked UPFs to obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers and an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And just last month, research eating too many UPFs could be stopping you from losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;British scientists who tracked dozens of adults found those who avoided UPFs, lost twice as much weight as those who often consumed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sticking to meals cooked from scratch could also help curb food cravings, but UPFs had little impact on blood pressure, heart rate, liver function and cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They argued their findings echoed calls to limit certain types of UPFs but cautioned it also showed not all UPFs are 'inherently unhealthy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Samuel Dicken, from University College London, study co-author, said: 'We saw significantly greater weight loss on the minimally processed food diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-ef5a3e00-8744-11f0-b943-7310ff2ac219" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15054609/Longevity-experts-food-additives-worst-health.html"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus was shown to cause autism-like behaviors in mice. Drugs that reduce this activity reversed the symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/stanford-university/"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt; studying the neurological basis of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;autism spectrum disorder&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social communication, repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities. The spectrum includes a wide range of abilities and symptoms, which can vary significantly between individuals. The exact causes of ASD are complex and involve both genetic and environmental factors.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/span&gt; have found that excessive activity in a particular brain region may be responsible for driving behaviors commonly linked to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of autism, the team identified the reticular thalamic nucleus, a structure that filters sensory information between the thalamus and cortex, as a promising treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, they showed that administering drugs to dampen activity in this brain region reversed autism-like symptoms in the mice, including seizure susceptibility, heightened sensitivity to stimuli, increased motor activity, repetitive actions, and reduced social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shared pathways with epilepsy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These same drugs are also under investigation as potential treatments for epilepsy, underscoring how the mechanisms that drive autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy may intersect in the brain and help explain why the two conditions often appear in the same individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Science Advances&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;Science Advances&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). It covers a broad range of disciplines including biology, physics, social sciences, and engineering. The journal emphasizes impactful, interdisciplinary research with wide relevance.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The senior author of the study is John Huguenard, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences. The lead author is Sung-Soo Jang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in neurology and neurological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connections between the thalamus and cortex have been linked to autism in both people and animal models, but the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus had remained uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers recorded the neural activity of this brain region in mice while observing the animals’ behavior. In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population — 30% versus 1% — though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings highlight the reticular thalamic nucleus as a novel target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, children with higher levels of Aggressiveness, Neuroticism, and Negative Valence tended to have more severe ADHD symptoms, while children with higher levels of Conscientiousness tended to have fewer symptoms. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-0001/a000437"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily functioning. It typically begins in childhood, though symptoms often continue into adolescence and adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact causes are not fully understood, but research suggests a strong genetic component, with heritability estimates of around 70–80%. Environmental influences, such as prenatal exposure to alcohol, nicotine, or stress, can also increase risk. Early childhood factors like low birth weight or lead exposure may contribute to its development. Without recognition, ADHD can lead to academic underachievement, strained relationships, and emotional difficulties. With support, many individuals learn strategies to manage symptoms effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Tatjana Krstić and her colleagues sought to evaluate the relationships between personality traits and the severity of ADHD symptoms in middle school children. In particular, they wanted to see whether personality traits are linked to specific ADHD symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 402 parents of children aged 10 to 15 years, with an average child age of 13. About 51% of the children were boys. Parents ranged in age from 29 to 63, with an average age of 43. Children were recruited from six schools in Serbia located in both urban and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents rated their children’s ADHD symptom severity and personality traits. For ADHD symptoms, the researchers used the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale – version IV (SNAP-IV), which includes items such as “Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.” To assess personality, they used the parent version of the Big Five Plus Two for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personality assessment measured the five widely studied personality traits—Neuroticism (e.g., “Often has the jitters”), Extraversion (e.g., “Has many friends”), Aggressiveness (e.g., “Often yells at others when provoked”), Conscientiousness (e.g., “Always fulfills his/her obligations”), and Openness (e.g., “Likes new and interesting things”). It also included two additional traits: Positive Valence (e.g., “Has a big influence in a peer group”) and Negative Valence (e.g., “Thinks that he/she is no good”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that children with more severe ADHD symptoms tended to show higher levels of Aggressiveness, Neuroticism, and Negative Valence. They tended to score lower on Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness. The severity of ADHD symptoms was not associated with Positive Valence. When the researchers examined the unique contributions of personality traits in predicting ADHD severity, the association with Extraversion was no longer significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings supported the conclusion that personality traits in children are predictors of ADHD symptoms,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific knowledge about the links between personality and ADHD. However, it should be noted that all the data in this study came from parents, leaving room for reporting bias and common method bias to have affected the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-0001/a000437"&gt;The Relationship Between Personality Traits and ADHD Symptoms in 10- to 15-Year-Old Children: Parent Ratings,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Tatjana Krstić, Ilija Milovanović, Aleksandra Stojadinović, Vojislava Bugarski Ignjatović, and Željka Nikolašević.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:19:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQWVRsRHNmN0JYUDdMb092dkFlREpfb1FzTlRCU01TalI4V21QVTFUUzY0cmRDS1RJOVRxeC16NnM4ZHFZbndBTlV1bThGTVhfSGYwc090RTFRcFZMVkYyNktRRGtQdWh6SVdHeVdrV3VqUE9KaGxndTlaTXV6aDAtNE15dF84MjBKU0FqNUt2YXlHbDYxTVEtUFNJaDExbHRfNk93TExSR0FKaGRQ</guid></item><item><title>“我做了五年的普拉提和重量训练–这里有更好的结果” - Women's Health</title><link>https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a65947988/pilates-vs-weight-training-challenge/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-1byop6q et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="0" class="body_content_break_0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-16gxnpx emevuu60"&gt;Athlete Keltie O’Connor has &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a40743707/weight-lifting-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a40743707/weight-lifting-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight-trained" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight-trained&lt;/a&gt; for 15 years.

Yes, you can also engage the smaller muscles in weight training, but I just find for myself there are little muscles that I'm like, “Oh yeah I never work on that”, and Pilates is good at using those.

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metformin, the world’s most prescribed diabetes drug, is known for benefits far beyond blood sugar control, yet its precise workings have remained a mystery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers at Kobe University have now provided the first clinical evidence that the drug alters metal levels in the blood, lowering copper and iron while raising zinc, which may help explain its protective effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Metformin: More Than Just a Diabetes Drug&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin is the most commonly prescribed medication for diabetes worldwide. In addition to lowering blood sugar, it has been linked to a wide range of positive health effects, including protection against tumors, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Yet, despite more than 60 years of use, scientists still do not fully understand how it works, which has slowed efforts to design even more effective treatments for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Investigating Metals in Diabetes Patients&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kobe University endocrinologist Wataru Ogawa, “It is known that diabetes patients experience changes in the blood levels of metals such as copper, iron, and zinc. In addition, chemical studies found that metformin has the ability to bind certain metals, such as copper, and recent studies showed that it is this binding ability that might be responsible for some of the drug’s beneficial effects. So, we wanted to know whether metformin actually affects blood metal levels in humans, which had not been clarified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, Ogawa and his colleagues conducted a study involving roughly 200 diabetes patients at Kobe University Hospital. Half of the participants were taking metformin, while the other half were not. The researchers compared blood serum samples from both groups, measuring levels of copper, iron, and zinc, as well as indicators of possible metal deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First Clinical Evidence of Metal Shifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the journal &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open Diabetes Research &amp;amp; Care,&lt;/em&gt; the Kobe University team has now published the first clinical evidence of altered blood metal levels in patients taking metformin. They found that patients who take it have significantly lower copper and iron levels and higher zinc levels. Ogawa says, “It is significant that we could show this in humans. Furthermore, since decreases in copper and iron concentrations and an increase in zinc concentration are all considered to be associated with improved glucose tolerance and prevention of complications, these changes may indeed be related to metformin’s action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comparing Metformin and Imeglimin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Japan has approved the use of imeglimin, a new diabetes drug that is a derivative of metformin but that should not be able to bind metals the same way as its parent. “Imeglimin is thought to have a different method of action, and we are already conducting studies to compare the effects the two drugs have,” says Ogawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Towards Smarter Diabetes Treatments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just about understanding the current drugs, however. Ogawa explains the bigger picture, saying: “We need both clinical trials and animal experiments to pinpoint the causal relationship between the drug’s action and its effects. If such studies progress further, they may lead to the development of new drugs for diabetes and its complications by properly adjusting the metal concentrations in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;

But Cuomo's observation adds that, once a person is sick, the body's needs might change and the goal shifts to fighting the disease and surviving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients fighting cancer or heart disease, body fat and cholesterol can serve as crucial energy reserves, helping the body withstand the immense metabolic stress of illness. Cholesterol is also a fundamental building block needed to repair cells damaged by disease or harsh treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while alcohol is a known carcinogen, moderate intake has been linked to better heart disease survival. It also appears to improve cholesterol levels, reduce blood clot formation and increase insulin sensitivity, which may benefit an already-diagnosed patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is biomedical scientist Raphael E Cuomo. A counterintuitive medical finding, termed Cuomo's Paradox, reveals that factors like obesity or alcohol, which increase the risk of developing a disease, may actually be linked to living longer after a diagnosis is received&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cuomo described the paradox in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(25)00472-9/fulltext"&gt;The Journal for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; and offered two possible explanations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, it may be a false signal. A severe, advanced disease like cancer or heart failure causes the body to waste away, leading to weight loss and plummeting cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, low weight and low cholesterol levels might not be the cause of poor survival. Instead, they are a symptom of the aggressive disease process that is already underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are not recommending that patients gain weight after a diagnosis, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The observation is that patients who are already overweight or obese at the time of their diagnosis often show better survival rates compared to normal-weight or underweight patients with the same disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second possible explanation is that there may be real biological mechanisms at play. Body fat serves as a store of energy that the body can tap into to meet the demands of fighting their disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These energy reserves also help patients tolerate the side effects of treatments like chemotherapy and radiation and reduce the risk of becoming dangerously malnourished and weak, a condition called cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, high cholesterol is a clogging agent that increases a healthy person’s risk of developing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Age-adjusted deaths per 100,000 people due to heart disease have been steadily declining since 1950. Death rates have plummeted from almost 600 per 100,000 in 1950 to around 160 per 100,000 deaths in 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer diagnoses, particularly colorectal cancer, are likely to continue ticking up in part due to major disruptions to preventive healthcare during the Covid pandemic. Nearly 130,000 cancers were missed in 2020 and 2021, or nine percent less than the expected number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in a patient who is already battling cancer or another chronic illness, fatty molecules in the blood, including cholesterol and lipids, are sources of energy for the body to tap into and use in its fight against advancing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cholesterol is also a vital component of cell membranes. To heal damaged tissues resulting from disease, radiation, or chemotherapy, the body requires a sufficient amount of cholesterol to rebuild healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also helps control the production and release of hormones like estrogen and cortisol, which regulate the body's response to illness, maintain muscle mass, and manage inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol is classified by the World Health Organization as a class 1 carcinogen, a substance that has been proven to cause cancer in humans based on sufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Cuomo's Paradox reveals that for patients already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently linked to better survival in observational studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which helps remove ‘bad’ cholesterol from the arteries, slowing plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderate intake can also make the body more sensitive to insulin, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, a significant risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Factors like obesity, often linked to disease risk, are paradoxically associated with better survival outcomes in some patients after a diagnosis, suggesting nutritional needs shift once illness strikes (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also make blood platelets less ‘sticky,’ which reduces the formation of blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the paradox, the stress of withdrawal or the loss of a perceived benefit, such as antioxidants in red wine, could theoretically do more harm than good in heart disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This does not mean that being overweight, drinking or having high cholesterol is beneficial for someone without a disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that rigorously enforcing prevention guidelines in sick, weakened patients might be ineffective and could even undermine their strength and well-being. Each patient's care must be tailored to their individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritional guidance should also not be abandoned. Instead, it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14996863/Not-ultra-processed-foods-bad-you-study-reveals-eight-actually-make-you-healthier.html"&gt;should be tailored&lt;/a&gt; to the specific stage of a patient's health journey, Cuomo said, rather than based on standard prevention advice, such as reducing cholesterol or losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cuomo &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/about/news/archive/2025/08-04-cuomo-paradox.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Healthy should be defined relative to a person’s stage in life and goals. Cuomo’s Paradox reframes health as prevention versus survival. My research has uncovered pre-diagnosis versus post-diagnosis as a core variable in nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It became clear to me that prevention advice and survivorship advice must be separated.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmevvma4o000t28p1geng6fgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to the discourse over longevity, the “bro scientists” are mostly leading the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00053b6nvpfq0hla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s according to longevity specialist Dr. Vonda Wright, whose new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593736583?tag=randohouseinc7986-20" target="_blank"&gt;Unbreakable:&lt;/a&gt;  A Woman’s Guide to Aging With Power,” aims to level the playing field.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00063b6ny73l9946@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a gamut of people framing men living longer as longevity and a very hopeful message,” said Wright, an orthopedic surgeon and author based in Orlando. That is a positive thing, but “for generations, when you think of women living longer, the solution is anti-aging, as if there’s something wrong with us. There’s nothing wrong with us. We are aging in a different way than men.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00073b6n0xob90in@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women do &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/13/health/life-expectancy-gender-gap"&gt;live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;, on average. But Wright is focusing not just on living longer but also living better. And in her book, she addresses female longevity from the perspectives of women. She notes the role that shifting hormones play in this process and encourages women to work on disease prevention  and strength building during their early midlife years — instead of waiting on good health to run out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00083b6n6ov82pfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those years — think 35 to 45&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;years old — can be used as a time to strengthen oneself rather than to succumb to the myth that one’s best days are in the past, she said. Wright calls it the “critical decade.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00093b6n8y11wat1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I believe and have shown that with a daily investment in our mobility, in smart nutrition, in mobilizing our mindset,” Wright said, “we can live healthy, vital, active, joyful, unbreakable lives long into the foreseeable future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000a3b6nkrq3d1rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN spoke with Wright about how women can work toward aging with power.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I spend a lot of time in the first part of my book asking women to identify what their values are — their “why” for making changes. I value independence — getting to do what I want when I want to do it. If I receive help, it’s because I want it, not because I need it. I value a clear brain. Once you know your values, you can form your goals. Many women don’t want to be a burden to their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are some important scientific findings on female aging, and how do they inform your advice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000f3b6nrmwfxgih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wright:&lt;/strong&gt; There are estrogen receptors everywhere, from brain to muscle to bone. Without estrogen, nearly every organ system is affected, meaning the rate of aging increases. For instance, during &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/health/menopause-women-midlife-hormones-wellness"&gt;the perimenopause period&lt;/a&gt;, women can lose 15% to 20% of our bone density. That’s more rapid (than the bone density loss men  experience as they age). The brain starves without estrogen, and the lack can also increase inflammation and risk for cardiovascular disease. Making your hormone optimization decision &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/hormone-therapy-for-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;based on facts&lt;/a&gt;, not fear, is one of the first decisions I want women to make.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m going to give you some frameworks and practical tips. No. 1: We are not losing weight. We are recomposing, meaning it matters what we’re made of, because we’re trying to maximize lean muscle and minimize body fat — not to be skinny but to be lean.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000i3b6nikdmjwe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No. 2: Women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/health/eating-disorders-food-2023-wellness"&gt;deserve to eat&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been taught for generations that we can only be little, and therefore we don’t eat. But you must eat to be healthy, so what do we eat? I’m a big proponent of 1 gram of protein per ideal pound a day, so that we support the muscle we’re trying to build.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000j3b6nqhst6t22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But we have got to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/28/health/cutting-added-sugar-recommendations-wellness"&gt;stop eating so much sugar&lt;/a&gt; in this country, because it’s cooking us from the inside out. It contributes to multiple diseases caused by chronic, age-related inflammation. I’m not against carbs; I’m against simple carbs and sugar because of what they do to &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000941.htm" target="_blank"&gt;our glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;, which measures how quickly a food makes your blood sugar rise.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I prescribe exercise with the acronym “FACE” your future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000n3b6n6z2hq34x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The F is flexibility and joint range of motion&lt;/strong&gt;. Tendons, ligaments and muscles naturally shorten with time, which results in stiff joints and people being hunched over and shuffling around. Some great exercises for that are Pilates, yoga, tai chi and dynamic stretching.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000o3b6nn2u7jmkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

I prescribe 80-20 aerobic activity, which means 80% of the time we are in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/talk-test-exercise-intensity-cdc-wellness"&gt;lower heart rate exercise&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s walking or something else, and 20% of the time we are sprinting. This is modeled after what we do with pro athletes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The C is “carry a load.”&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is strength and power, so lifting heavy is very well detailed for hundreds of pages in this book. Basically, it means fewer reps, higher weights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000q3b6n339t80ap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Finally, E is equilibrium&lt;/strong&gt;, or balance, and foot speed. You may be strong and flexible, but if you trip and fall, you often have what’s called a fatal fall and break something that 50% of the time puts you in a nursing home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;That might start with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/29/health/5-steps-habit-builder-wellness"&gt;creating a streak&lt;/a&gt;. For seven days in a row, you’re doing something that’s helpful to your body, such as walking every day after your biggest meal. Then you don’t want to stop because you’ve worked hard.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000u3b6nz1fa1gow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also start a foundational or starting lifting program. I have one of those in my book, just to teach you how to move your body. It will take six or nine months to work up to heavy, but it’s not hard. Hiring a trainer to teach you is very helpful. I encourage people, as the holidays are coming up, don’t ask for a purse or some appliance. Ask for a trainer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Once you arrive there, that is what you should do for the rest of your life, because we’re trying to build strength and power, not necessarily endurance or bigger muscles.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the best ways to build mental resilience?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000x3b6n161akm60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;The work that I cite in the book is built around &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/how-to-choose-therapist-wellness"&gt;building mental hardiness&lt;/a&gt;, and there are 10 hardiness factors. Interestingly, one of them is physical activity. The &lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13740661" target="_blank"&gt;research I looked at&lt;/a&gt;, by Dr. Paul Bartone and Dr. Steven Stein, was done on prisoners of war, current US Army Rangers and people with really tough congenital problems. One common characteristic of all those people is they had a physical activity practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000y3b6nrqtthf2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you learn to lift heavy, what happens physically is you get stronger. But every time you’re done lifting, your brain feels invincible. Another example is that I do Spartan Stadion obstacle course races in legendary stadiums, and I frequently invite women who follow me on social media to join me. They show up in all states of fitness — some not fit, some world-class athletes. When they finish doing hard physical things, their brain has also changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000z3b6nabhqagai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s really important to realize that you are worth the daily investment in your health. Many times people, especially women, prioritize everything in the world in front of themselves. But the reality is, to do the work, we need to realize that we are worth the daily investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old who still drives herself to book club, the 82-year-old managing his investments online, the couple in their late 70s who just booked another trip abroad—they all share something beyond good genes or luck. They've mastered the art of the quiet habit, those small, consistent practices that compound into independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask them their secret, and they won't mention miracle supplements or extreme fitness routines. Instead, they'll tell you about morning stretches, afternoon walks, evening puzzles. The unglamorous stuff that doesn't sell magazines but does preserve autonomy. These aren't the habits of superhumans; they're the practices of people who understand that maintaining independence isn't about grand gestures but daily maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science backs them up. Independence after 70 isn't just about physical health—it's a delicate ecosystem of mental sharpness, social connection, and purposeful routine. And the people who crack the code? They're the ones treating their independence like a garden: tending it daily, quietly, consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They move something every single morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a workout. Not yoga at dawn. Just movement—gentle, deliberate, non-negotiable. Maybe it's ten minutes of stretching before their feet hit the floor. Perhaps it's walking to get the newspaper instead of having it delivered. The specifics don't matter; the consistency does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about fitness goals or step counts. It's about sending a daily message to your body: we're still in business. &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/everyday-fitness/senior-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Regular movement&lt;/a&gt; maintains joint flexibility, preserves balance, and keeps muscles from atrophying. But more importantly, it sets a tone for the day that says "I'm capable." The 78-year-old who starts with morning stretches is more likely to tackle afternoon gardening, evening cooking. It's momentum disguised as a morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They keep their brain on a low simmer all day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't find them doing marathon Sudoku sessions or cramming for mental fitness. Instead, they pepper their day with small cognitive challenges. Reading the news and discussing it. Trying a new recipe without checking the instructions twice. Taking a different route to familiar places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/participating-activities-you-enjoy-you-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive engagement&lt;/a&gt; doesn't require formal brain training. The sharper seniors treat their minds like muscles that need varied exercise throughout the day, not intense weekly workouts. They argue (gently) about politics, learn their grandkid's video game, attempt the crossword without immediately googling. These micro-challenges maintain neural plasticity better than any app claiming to reverse aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They schedule something social before noon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not parties or large gatherings—just connection. Coffee with a neighbor at 10 AM. A standing Tuesday grocery trip with a friend. A morning call to check on someone. They've learned that &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/10-common-misconceptions-about-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt; creeps in quietly, so they build defenses into their morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning social contact serves multiple purposes. It provides accountability (someone notices if you don't show up), mental stimulation (conversation exercises different brain regions than solitary activities), and emotional regulation (human connection stabilizes mood). The truly clever ones combine it with other needs—walking groups, breakfast clubs, volunteer shifts. They're not just being social; they're engineering reasons to stay engaged with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They tackle their hardest task before lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills, medical calls, complex decisions—whatever requires the most mental energy happens in the morning. Not because they're morning people necessarily, but because they've noticed their cognitive reserves peak before noon. By 2 PM, even simple tasks feel monumental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't procrastination management; it's energy economics. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5477556/aging-brain-health-lifestyle-diet-exercise-social-alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Successful aging&lt;/a&gt; involves recognizing your body's rhythms and working with them, not against them. The independent seniors have learned to surf their energy waves rather than fight them. Complex medication management at 9 AM, not 9 PM. Important conversations when sharp, not tired. They're quietly strategic about when they deploy their cognitive resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They eat the same healthy breakfast without thinking about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No daily debates about what to eat. No decision fatigue over breakfast. They've found something nutritious that works—oatmeal with walnuts, eggs with spinach, yogurt with berries—and they stick with it. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about the perfect diet; it's about removing friction from healthy choices. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9903079/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nutritional consistency&lt;/a&gt; in older adults correlates with better health outcomes, not because any single breakfast is magical, but because automation frees mental energy for other decisions. When eating well becomes as automatic as brushing teeth, it's more likely to happen even on difficult days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain one thing they control completely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A garden plot. A workshop. A craft room. A recipe collection. Something that's entirely theirs, where they make all the decisions, where their competence is unquestioned. This domain becomes their independence laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an area of complete autonomy does something profound psychologically. It counters the creeping helplessness that often accompanies aging. When you can't control your declining vision but can control your tomato plants, you maintain what psychologists call self-efficacy. These personal kingdoms, however small, become proof that they're still capable agents in their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They prep tomorrow tonight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothes laid out. Pills organized. Shopping list written. Coffee maker loaded. They spend ten minutes each evening removing tomorrow's friction. It's not about memory issues—it's about energy conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening ritual serves as both practical preparation and psychological reassurance. Waking up to a day that's already partially handled reduces morning stress and preserves decision-making capacity for unexpected challenges. But more subtly, it's an act of self-compassion—tonight's self taking care of tomorrow's self. The independent elderly have learned to be their own best assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They protect their sleep like a vault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No late-night TV binges. No revenge bedtime procrastination. They treat sleep like the medical intervention it is. Consistent bedtime, consistent wake time, bedroom kept cool and dark. They're not rigid about it, but they're respectful of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/10-common-misconceptions-about-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quality sleep in older adults&lt;/a&gt; affects everything: cognitive function, physical recovery, emotional regulation, immune response. The independent seniors have noticed the correlation between bad nights and bad days. So they've quietly built fortresses around their sleep: no caffeine after 2 PM, no screens in bed, no trying to "push through" fatigue. They've learned that protecting sleep is protecting independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's striking about these habits: they're all defensive plays, not offensive ones. The successfully independent elderly aren't trying to turn back time or achieve peak performance. They're playing prevent defense against dependence. Every morning stretch is a hedge against immobility. Every social coffee is insurance against isolation. Every protected sleep hour is an investment in tomorrow's clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've figured out what younger people often miss: independence isn't a state you achieve but a condition you maintain. Like a garden or a friendship or a skill, it requires daily attention—not dramatic intervention, just consistent, quiet care. These habits aren't sexy or revolutionary. They won't trend on social media or spawn bestselling books. But they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real wisdom isn't in any single habit but in the approach: small, sustainable, stackable. The 70-somethings who thrive understand that independence is won in the margins, in the thousand tiny decisions that either preserve capability or surrender it. They've learned to be gentle architects of their own autonomy, building independence not through force but through patience, not through intensity but through consistency. And in that quiet persistence, they've found the secret to something increasingly rare: aging on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I am a 68-year-old male who weighs 130 pounds and is 5 feet, 7 inches tall. I am in good shape and work out regularly. I had my prostate removed in 2023 after about six years of active surveillance, and I just finished radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VYJHB3LBZZBNNIFLQ7IQSVZCDM"&gt;I’ve taken vitamins for as long as I can remember. I take Centrum Silver multivitamins, fish oil, calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporosis. When doing some research, I read that selenium and vitamin E are not good to take if you have prostate cancer, and they are included in Centrum Silver. The fish oil had conflicting information, with some saying it was good and others saying it wasn’t good to take if you have prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PDUVEA5AGJDPLAJR4642KHPPGU"&gt;Should I continue taking these vitamins, or should I stop? Could these have made my cancer worse? If I stop, should I wean off them or stop altogether? What are your recommendations on these vitamins/supplements affecting prostate cancer or my health in general? I would hate to think that taking them could do more harm than good. I eat very well (lots of fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, and lean red meats). I drink green tea and lots of water to stay hydrated. -- Anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JFBRGOOTFFB5PHWKBG7TAYFH2E"&gt;ANSWER: Several supplements have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The evidence is moderately strong with vitamin E. A large study designed to look for benefits had to be stopped by the safety committee, and an analysis showed a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I6P2SOICYRE25DSNJGI5P5RLTA"&gt;Some studies found an increase in prostate cancer risk with fish oil, while others didn’t. In my opinion, men with prostate cancer (or those who are at a high risk for it) should not take vitamin E. Unless you are clearly recommended fish oil based on your triglyceride level or for some other clinical indication, I don’t recommend it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BGJI746DK5BONAT5IRUHQ2KKBA"&gt;Because your multivitamin contains vitamin E and selenium, another mineral that may increase prostate cancer risk, I recommend against it for any man with prostate cancer. There is no need to taper off it slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J6QCXV3RQJAXPEFWGY4RTTJM4E"&gt;As far as diet, a more plant-based diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats with limited intake of animal fats, processed meats and refined carbohydrates has been shown to improve outcomes among prostate cancer survivors. Lean meats are better than fatty ones, but I would still emphasize plants more. Green tea has speculated but unproven benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 78-year-male in overall good health. Based on certain symptoms (foamy urine and a previous eGFR of 55), my nephrologist has instructed me to have a metabolic blood test. Regarding the blood test, his instructions regarding the blood test were not to fast. I have never taken a metabolic test without fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7ATGGXJ5IVHVNE355PFWPO6N4Q"&gt;My research revealed that by fasting, your test results are more realistic. My research also revealed that by not fasting, one’s creatinine reading wouldn’t be affected. What should I do? Fast or not? -- B.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2AW7TQJZGZBPLP75ZINTCOR3UE"&gt;ANSWER: Clearly you should heed the instructions of your nephrologist. Blood tests without fasting provide a measure of what your body chemistry is like under the most usual conditions. You are right that creatinine isn’t much affected by diet, although heavy meat consumption will make the creatinine reading a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3Y7AVJQJ5JCP5BZRJKNUXWOIOA"&gt;Blood sugar and lipid tests are most affected by fasting, and while lipid tests are generally standardized to the fasting state, blood sugar tests need to be interpreted according to whether a person is fasting or not. Measuring blood sugar after ingesting a known quantity of sugar is the most sensitive way of diagnosing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2LJ3BRBUTVBWREG5N3A2O4HM5A"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A food writer prioritizes protein at all meals for weight management and to feel more full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High protein pantry items including canned and dried beans, walnuts and even plant-protein pastas are staples thanks to their versatility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These pantry protein options are also budget-friendly to keep grocery bills in check.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no question about it: it can be a challenge to switch from a carb-heavy eating plan to one that relies on eating more healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7821676/protein-nation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you feel more satisfied and keeps you feeling fuller longer. I started focusing on getting more protein in my meals when I set about losing the weight that I had gained during my heady first few years as a restaurant critic. So much of what I once considered convenience food simply wasn’t on the menu once I committed to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292114/high-protein-meal-plan-1500-calories/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein meal plan&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While most of my dinners at home focus on lean meat (or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-plant-based-diet-recipes-to-make-first-11735924" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt;) and vegetables, my busy workdays require me to keep things simpler at lunch and snack times. Buying some high-protein staples that don’t require refrigeration makes my life easier and my wallet heavier, but most important, these staples leave me feeling good after I eat them. Here are my standbys. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I’m far from a vegetarian, but I appreciate the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/most-saved-chickpea-recipes-11785873" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lean protein offered by using chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; as the centerpiece of a meal. I may have learned to cook them first as part of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255186/chickpea-curry-chhole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Indian recipes&lt;/a&gt;, but the legumes are super-versatile. I like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279247/everything-bagel-crispy-chickpeas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;crisping them up and coating them in everything seasoning for a snack&lt;/a&gt;, but few recipes feed my need for creamy, tomatoey goodness quite like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-chickpeas-8431869" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;using chickpeas in a meat-free version of Marry Me Chicken&lt;/a&gt;. It’s like a hybrid of my beloved Indian stews and the best of Italy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though there’s nothing quite like making your own jerky with an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/affiliate/7904760/best-food-dehydrators/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;at-home dehydrator&lt;/a&gt;, I am among the majority of people that simply don’t have the time to do so regularly. As a devotee of Korean barbecue, I sometimes treat myself to the almost dessert-like charms of Golden Island pork jerky from Costco, but more often, I just buy Walmart-brand beef jerky, with its 13 grams of protein and 5 grams of total carbs per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My mother eats an early dinner, then finishes the evening with what she calls a “tummy filler.” Using her as inspiration, when I’m still hungry after dinner, my favorite “tummy filler” is slices of Macintosh apple with almond butter. An open secret? This is even better with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251354/apple-with-cinnamon-almond-butter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a dusting of cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When I lived in Texas, you wouldn’t have caught me dead adding beans to chili. But then a dear friend sent me a Rancho Gordo chili kit as an unexpected wedding gift. I realized that I loved both the texture and low-fat protein of the heirloom beans. Now I’m more likely to do an inexpensive riff using canned pinto or Great Northern beans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269830/chicken-chili-verde/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in a recipe with boneless, skinless chicken thighs&lt;/a&gt;.

Often, that meant less-than-appealing protein-powder potages, but since then, I’ve discovered that when I don’t have time to make my own more flavorful options, cans of Progresso will do in a pinch. I prefer to stick to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced-sodium options&lt;/a&gt;, including Italian wedding soup, which boasts around 160 calories per can and keeps me full until dinner.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s nothing wrong with eating regular pasta sometimes (&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-dont-always-eat-whole-wheat-pasta-8648575" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;just ask our in-house dietitian&lt;/a&gt;), but when I’m trying to get a little extra &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7833141/high-protein-pasta-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein out of my noodle dish&lt;/a&gt;, I lean on wheat replacements like Barilla’s Protein+, which is made with a blend of conventional flour, chickpeas, lentils and peas. It doesn’t cook up grainy like old-school “healthy” pastas, so I don’t feel guilty serving it to the rest of my family.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, I avoided having any kind of bread in my house. But I often went through my days feeling slightly hungry. Finding the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7897382/im-a-dietitian-and-this-is-my-favorite-healthy-bread/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;right bread&lt;/a&gt; made my life happier. My favorite is the sliced seeds and grains loaf from The Avocado Bread Company. It’s a hearty, rustic cousin to my old favorites from Dave’s Killer Bread, but with 5 grams of protein per slice, less sweetness, and a hint of guacamole-style spices like cumin and paprika. I use it not just in sandwiches, but also as breadcrumbs in meatballs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a supply of high-protein foods on hand at all times in my pantry makes it easy to add more protein any time I feel my meals are lacking. The best part is that the budget-friendliness of most of my favorites keeps my grocery bill mercifully low. That means I might have a little extra in my budget to splurge on higher-quality meats or specialty fruits and vegetables. &lt;br&gt;

I plod down the stairs, gripping the rail to lighten my steps so as not to wake my two toddlers.

However, none of the studies referenced in the discussion were linked on the FDA’s webpage. The ideas presented lacked nuance and framed one set of choices as right and the other as wrong — a hallmark of pseudoscience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, M.D., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-23/fda-panel-on-ssri-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raises-alarms" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="highlighted the potential benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-23/fda-panel-on-ssri-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raises-alarms" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="20"&gt;&lt;span&gt;highlighted the potential benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. She shared that suicide is the No. 1 cause of maternal death during the perinatal period and referred to antidepressants as one of the “tools” available to combat this epidemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antidepressants may not suit everyone’s needs, and they are not the only treatment for mental health (although they are often the most accessible). For many people with mental illness, they are considered the first line of defense and can even enhance the effectiveness of other treatment modalities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking my antidepressant makes me a better mom. My kids (including the one in my womb) reap the benefits of a mother who is not spiraling into a pit of anxiety and despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although it’s not a magic bullet, my SSRI allows me to manage my pendulum of emotions and complete the many tasks and responsibilities that go along with being a working parent, military spouse, and mom to littles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mild side effects and risks associated with taking my antidepressant pale in comparison to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="risks of untreated maternal mental health disorders" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="21"&gt;&lt;span&gt;risks of untreated maternal mental health disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which include low birth weight, preterm birth, preeclampsia, difficulty bonding after birth and an overall increased risk of infant and maternal mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the panel discussion, Roussos-Ross emphasized the importance of balancing the treatment of both mother and child, stating that one’s health is not more important than the other’s. When I watched the panel, it struck me how many of the “experts” dismissed the mother’s well-being, amplifying the pervasive cultural myth that mothers must deny their own needs in service to their offspring (which is promoted by trends like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="intensive mothering" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="22"&gt;&lt;span&gt;intensive mothering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and natural parenting). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Less than 16%" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="23"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Less than 16%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of women with maternal depression (including both antenatal and postpartum depression) receive treatment, due to a lack of awareness and stigma. Mothers deserve access to current, accurate and evidence-based information so that they can make informed decisions with support from their healthcare providers. They need to know that opting to take an SSRI during pregnancy does not mean that they’re a “bad mom” or that they’re failing their kid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m grateful that I’ve had the choice to continue taking my SSRI throughout my pregnancies, and I worry that the FDA’s recent panel will limit women’s choices during a time when our freedoms are already under attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moms like me matter ― and if we need antidepressants to be healthy and to take the best possible care of our kids, then we should all have access to them ― with no judgment attached. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I plod down the stairs, gripping the rail to lighten my steps so as not to wake my two toddlers. The following 30-45 minutes of alone time are a treasured commodity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After letting the dog out and feeding him (because even with the kids asleep, I still have another creature’s needs to consider before my own), I settle into my desk chair with my coffee, water and toast. I glance at the calendar ― just two more weeks until my mom flies in town to help with the kids.

The ideas presented lacked nuance and framed one set of choices as right and the other as wrong — a hallmark of pseudoscience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, M.D., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-23/fda-panel-on-ssri-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raises-alarms" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="highlighted the potential benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-23/fda-panel-on-ssri-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raises-alarms" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="21"&gt;&lt;span&gt;highlighted the potential benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

When I watched the panel, it struck me how many of the “experts” dismissed the mother’s well-being, amplifying the pervasive cultural myth that mothers must deny their own needs in service to their offspring (which is promoted by trends like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="intensive mothering" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="23"&gt;&lt;span&gt;intensive mothering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and natural parenting). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Less than 16%" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Less than 16%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of women with maternal depression (including both antenatal and postpartum depression) receive treatment, due to a lack of awareness and stigma.

This fluid can then be tested for signs of melanoma using a two-line strip test. The microneedles are 0.6 millimeters long and less than 0.0001 millimeters wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EKXE4IEARNA6DAS2U3543IBKPQ"&gt;The researchers found patients can put the ExoPatch on their skin wherever they suspect they have melanoma and, after 30 minutes, dissolve the hydrogel from the patch on the strip test to identify skin cancer, mimicking the test strips for COVID-19 detection kits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FSOZ4RIBPZGRPLNKRRJKZRZASU"&gt;“These days people want to take the liquid samples such as urine, blood and tears,” Yoon-Tae Kang, a staff scientist at Bio-Rad Laboratories and former UM postdoctoral fellow, said. “We are hoping to see some of the marker in this leakage sample.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HATFOZ6EGVD2DA4VHGNQ4V7FB4"&gt;Patients typically detect melanoma through a biopsy called dermoscopy, where patients removed a part of the mole they suspected was cancerous and sent the tissue sample to a pathology laboratory for inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IVX2AVG7WZFVPB5JO4YIZTLOS4"&gt;Scott Smith, a recent UM doctoral graduate and former lab researcher, said an at-home test is preferable to a biopsy because patients can avoid unnecessary cuts and scars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QRXCSAT2TVBYTFREIVR3D5MCYU"&gt;“They’ll have to remove the skin and stitch it up depending on how big it is,” Smith said. “If it ends up being benign or non-cancerous, then now you have a scar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KJ2TWSJ5Q5DXTDYLSSR6BNMSBY"&gt;Another reason Smith mentioned was that patients sometimes waited for months before seeing a doctor for their biopsy.

&lt;p&gt;A research group funded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison is set to invest £118 million ($169.6 million) in applying AI to vaccine research with the UK's Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxford Vaccine Group is leading the project to study the human immune system's response to serious bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance, targeting diseases including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, who ran the trials for COVID-19 vaccines, the project plans to employ so-called human challenge models – which expose human volunteers to bacteria under controlled conditions – then apply modern immunology and AI tools to pinpoint the immune responses that predict protection.&lt;/p&gt;

    

&lt;p&gt;"This program addresses one of the most urgent problems in infectious disease by helping us to understand immunity more deeply to develop innovative vaccines against deadly diseases that have so far evaded our attempts at prevention," Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;

        


        

&lt;p&gt;"By combining advanced immunology with artificial intelligence, and using human challenge models to study diseases, CoI-AI [Correlates of Immunity-Artificial Intelligence] will provide the tools we need to tackle serious infections and reduce the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. This is a new frontier in vaccine science."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established in 2023, the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT) aims to open its Oxford campus in 2027 following an investment of around £1 billion. It is set to provide research labs and computing capacity supported by Oracle, which Ellison helped found. In December 2024, the University of Oxford and the EIT launched their strategic alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellison has long voiced an interest in healthcare. During the keynote of Oracle's conference in 2022, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/21/ellison_oracle_healthcare/"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;: "If we're not careful… we're gonna bankrupt Western civilization unless we find a more efficient way of providing healthcare to everybody."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Ellison is said to have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/14/forbes_oracle_ellison_health_data/"&gt;contributed to the early US response to the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; during President Donald Trump's first term.&lt;/p&gt;

        

&lt;p&gt;Ellison continues to be close to US government projects, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/08/stargate_launch_delays/"&gt;remains a contributor to the $500 billion Stargate project&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to build a network of AI datacenters around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the current US administration has attracted criticism for its approach to vaccines. In August, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo"&gt;the US Department of Health and Human Services said it planned to cancel $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which promise to protect against viruses that cause flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Financial Times, Oxford Vaccine Group's Pollard said there was "huge concern" that the debate on vaccines in the US was threatening vaccines that protect millions of children's lives.&lt;/p&gt;

        

&lt;p&gt;"One of the greatest tools ever is being undermined by poor science and misinformation," he told the publication. ®&lt;/p&gt;                                
                    &lt;/div&gt;

By using large language models and a mathematical technique called topological data analysis, researchers mapped how online discourse in hate speech and misinformation communities aligns with language used in forums for conditions like borderline, antisocial, and narcissistic personality disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosion of online communication, especially on platforms like Reddit, has raised concerns about the spread of hate speech and misinformation. These types of content have been linked to real-world consequences, including increased prejudice, public health confusion, and even violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior work has connected toxic online behavior to personality features often discussed under the “Dark Triad” — narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Yet this is only part of the clinical terrain. In psychiatry’s diagnostic manuals, a set of conditions known as Cluster B personality disorders (antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic) are grouped together because they tend to involve heightened emotionality, impulsive or risk-taking behavior, and persistent difficulties in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who meet criteria for these disorders may show patterns such as intense and rapidly shifting emotions, a strong need for admiration or attention, disregard for rules or others’ rights, manipulative or hostile interactions, and fluctuating self-image. These features can manifest as antagonistic or combative language, quick escalation during conflict, and a tendency to frame interactions in terms of status, betrayal, or threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have had less success establishing how hate speech and misinformation might relate to psychiatric conditions more broadly, especially across the diagnostic spectrum in the DSM-5. A central question is whether distinctive linguistic patterns in toxic content align with features commonly associated with Cluster B—such as hostility, impulsivity, or unstable self-concept—or whether they reflect a more general psychological profile that cuts across diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge is the massive scale of online posts, which makes it difficult to analyze patterns across communities. Another difficulty lies in identifying whether speech patterns linked to hate or misinformation reflect a general psychological profile or traits more consistent with specific mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models like GPT-3, have created new opportunities to address these challenges. By extracting high-dimensional representations—called embeddings—of written text, researchers can now study the underlying structure and similarity of speech patterns across different types of content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had noticed that there was a certain antisocial component to hate speech, and had become curious if there would be a connection between hate speech and Cluster B personality disorders,” said study author Andrew Alexander, a 2nd year psychiatry resident at University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I came up with the idea of analyzing posts from these communities with large language models, I thought about misinformation as well and was curious, so I added misinformation communities to the analysis as well. I also expanded beyond solely Cluster B disorders and included more psychiatric disorders for the same reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers turned to Reddit, a platform organized into thousands of thematic forums known as subreddits. Because Reddit hosts a wide range of communities—including support groups for mental health, forums focused on conspiracies or misinformation, and communities known for controversial or hateful speech—it offered a rich dataset for comparing linguistic features across different types of discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team selected 54 subreddits for their analysis, dividing them into four categories: hate speech, misinformation, psychiatric disorder forums, and control groups. Communities flagged as spreading hate or misinformation were identified based on prior academic literature or Reddit’s own moderation decisions. Psychiatric disorder forums were included if they self-identified as such and contained user posts that reflected those conditions. Control communities were those unrelated to mental health, hate, or misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From each subreddit, the team gathered 1,000 posts. Two kinds of data representations were then created. First, “individual user post” embeddings were generated, based on single Reddit posts. Second, “distilled embeddings” were constructed by combining multiple posts from a community to reflect its overall tone and content. The researchers used GPT-3’s embedding model to translate each post into a 1,536-dimensional vector representing its semantic content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After constructing these embeddings, the researchers applied a method called zero-shot classification. This technique involves training a machine learning model on one type of data and then asking it to classify new data from a category it has not seen before. For this study, models were trained on embeddings from psychiatric disorder and control communities, and then used to classify embeddings from hate speech and misinformation communities. The goal was to see whether the speech patterns in hate or misinformation forums more closely resembled those found in psychiatric disorder communities or in neutral control forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this classification approach, the team used topological data analysis to visualize relationships between different types of communities. This method allowed them to create a map of the embedding space, showing how closely different clusters—such as hate speech, misinformation, or depression forums—were related based on the underlying structure of their language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification results suggested that the language in hate speech communities was more similar to that of psychiatric disorder communities than to control groups. Nearly 80% of the hate speech embeddings were classified as resembling psychiatric disorder communities, with the strongest associations found for Cluster B personality disorders: antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorder. Another frequent match was Schizoid Personality Disorder, a Cluster A condition characterized by social detachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hate speech posts often matched these disorder-associated embeddings, misinformation posts were more mixed. About a quarter of the misinformation embeddings were classified as resembling psychiatric disorder communities, with some resemblance to anxiety-related conditions. The rest were more closely aligned with control communities, suggesting that the linguistic markers in pure misinformation posts are not as tightly linked to psychiatric disorder forums as those found in hate speech communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topological data analysis reinforced these findings. On the map generated from the embeddings, psychiatric disorder forums clustered in a region that was directly connected to hate speech embeddings. Control communities, in contrast, were generally located in more distant or isolated regions. Interestingly, some misinformation communities also showed a bridge-like connection to the psychiatric disorder cluster, especially those involving COVID-related conspiracy theories, which have been associated with anxiety in prior studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis of the spatial layout revealed a gradient of similarity. Communities with the most overlap with hate speech—such as those focused on narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders—were positioned closest to the hate speech region. Others, like depression or post-traumatic stress disorder forums, were located further away. When the researchers re-ran their classification models while removing narcissistic and schizoid communities from the training data, hate speech embeddings were redistributed to other Cluster B disorders like borderline and antisocial personality disorder, as well as Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that hate speech shares a broad linguistic resemblance to communities characterized by emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, or hostility, rather than to just one specific disorder. Meanwhile, PTSD forums did not appear to share the same proximity to hate speech in the map, suggesting that Complex PTSD and classic PTSD may differ in meaningful linguistic ways—possibly supporting arguments that CPTSD is more closely aligned with personality disorders than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misinformation communities showed weaker and more variable connections. The clearest pattern emerged for anxiety-related content, especially in forums focused on COVID-19 misinformation. However, these links were less consistent across the dataset, and most misinformation embeddings clustered closer to control forums on the topological map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the most important takeaways are that there seems to be similarities in speech between hate speech and communities for certain psychiatric disorders, though it is not possible at the moment to conclusively determine why,” Alexander told PsyPost. “It could be that people with these disorders are more likely to engage in hate speech, or it is possible that these communities foster a lack of empathy that is reflected by speech similar to those seen in these disorders. For misinformation, I think the big takeaway is that there seems to be a slight similarity seen with the speech patterns in anxiety disorder communities, but psychiatric disorders likely are not the driving force behind misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers emphasized that their findings should not be interpreted as implying that individuals with psychiatric disorders are more likely to spread hate speech or misinformation. Instead, the results suggest that certain linguistic features present in hate speech resemble those found in online communities where users self-identify as having particular mental health conditions. These associations do not establish causality and should not be used to stigmatize people with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the study lies in its reliance on self-identified communities rather than clinically verified diagnoses. It remains uncertain whether the users in these psychiatric forums actually meet diagnostic criteria for the conditions discussed. Additionally, the study focused only on Reddit, which may not generalize to other social platforms with different user demographics or moderation practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It should be emphasized that this is based on social media community posts, not directly confirmed diagnoses. This means that this study would need to be followed up with one evaluating individuals with confirmed diagnoses to be more certain of the results, though I believe that these results are a fairly good indicator nonetheless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could benefit from incorporating more communities across platforms, expanding the range of mental health conditions studied, and collecting clinical data when possible. A more detailed understanding of how hate speech and misinformation evolve in different online environments could also help inform efforts to counteract their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000935" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Topological data mapping of online hate speech, misinformation, and general mental health: A large language model based study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Andrew William Alexander and Hongbin Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 12:09:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPb3Z3NkFGZVlzdFFWa1EyS2hCYVNUZXFPTnZBYmZXSzRFbmRGUXJsekU2X1J4TGpzSVI3cTRHWkdQa0laS0NCaUJOTFI5cUd1QUQzRmF5RHY2aUdrZmt3QTlCbmdGT2lfZW53VHhMVkdNS2VUYVY5bi13Z0FwM2tibUJnVjRzaGNBeXpZQ1k4SXdOaDI0bnZpNGNMZnkzOGRER3Bj</guid></item><item><title>我应该服用镁补充剂吗？您需要知道的一切-有线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-magnesium-supplements-good-for/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Suddenly, everyone is&lt;/span&gt; obsessed with magnesium supplements.

This is partly because magnesium is predominantly found in high-fiber foods, and a significant portion of Americans do not consume sufficient fiber, according to registered dietitian Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes. Research confirms this: &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;More than 90 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; and 97 percent of men fail to meet the recommended daily intake for dietary fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Older adults are particularly at risk, as the body's ability to absorb magnesium decreases with age. Health conditions like Crohn’s disease or kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, and the use of diuretics can all lead to magnesium depletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Anderson-Haynes notes that a magnesium deficiency (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987399/" target="_blank"&gt;also known as hypomagnesemia&lt;/a&gt;) can result in a range of symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, constipation, tremors, heart palpitations, and muscle soreness. Chronic magnesium deficiency can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="benefits-of-magnesium-supplements" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Benefits of Magnesium Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are several forms of magnesium supplements, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="paywall"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium citrate&lt;/strong&gt;: Often taken as a remedy for occasional constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium glycinate:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken for better sleep and reduced anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium oxide:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken for constipation or indigestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium l-threonate:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken for better sleep, cognitive function, and reduced stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium chloride:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken as an electrolyte replenisher and for its laxative effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Supplements are most useful for people with a confirmed deficiency, but &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-can-magnesium-do-for-you-and-how-much-do-you-need-202506033100" target="_blank"&gt;early research suggests&lt;/a&gt; possible benefits for specific conditions, including migraines, insomnia, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It’s really overlooked that magnesium can help with menstrual cycle irregularity in terms of making sure that you’re not having severe cramping,” says Anderson-Haynes, who adds it may also benefit &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/oura-perimenopause-report/" target="_blank"&gt;women in perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. Clinically, it may be part of the treatment for pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="can-you-take-too-much" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Can You Take Too Much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;recommended dietary allowance&lt;/a&gt; is 320 milligrams per day for women and 420 milligrams per day for men. These are amounts most people can reach with a balanced diet; healthy kidneys regulate magnesium levels, excreting excess when magnesium intake is high and conserving it when it’s low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Daily supplements under 350 milligrams are generally considered safe for healthy adults. “If you take too much magnesium, you’ll probably get diarrhea, because it loosens the bowels,” Anderson-Haynes says. Other side effects include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and, at very high levels of magnesium (usually from overusing laxatives or antacids), low blood pressure, muscle cramps, breathing problems, and, in rare cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease are at the highest risk of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="should-you-supplement" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Should You Supplement?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For most healthy adults, magnesium supplements aren’t essential. If you struggle &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-why-migraines-affect-women-more-than-men/" target="_blank"&gt;with migraines&lt;/a&gt;, insomnia, or other conditions where research suggests health benefits, they may be worth trying—but first talk to a health care professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Otherwise, focus on magnesium-rich foods. These include but are not limited to: legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), leafy greens (artichokes, kale, spinach), whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa), nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), fruit (bananas, avocado, dried apricots), and soy products (tofu, soy milk, edamame).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If you do decide to take any dietary supplements, “look for a seal or certification that says GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or NSF,” says Anderson-Haynes, stressing the importance of third-party tests and verifications, considering &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fda-label-cleared-approved/" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA doesn't regulate dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cFSKbf gBsRaY

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'In one interview, a doctor said: “In patients with gastrointestinal tumors, a few months before the diagnosis, a strong craving for sweets appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'"People eat ice cream by the kilo, even though they never cared for desserts before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The explanation is clear: tumor cells consume glucose faster than healthy ones, so the brain starts programming behavior to serve the disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The influencer also revealed a woman who was later diagnosed with kidney cancer, had claimed she could drink 'pickle brine straight from the jar and eat it with crackers'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another suddenly got 'hooked' on dairy products. Relatives thought it was just 'a phase' or 'new tastes'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In reality, the body sends messages in advance—most just delete them without even opening,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limited research has also suggested that changes in food behaviour could be a pre-cursor to cancer diagnoses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one 2022 review, analysing seven studies on the topic, Italian researchers noted that 'food cravings have been found to be associated with breast cancer, lymphoma, and ovarian or endometrial cancer'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9407804/"&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said: patients had higher cravings overall and for specific food subscales such as fast foods, sweets, carbohydrates—starchy food—and fats.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'We strongly recommend food behavior screening for cancer patients, both at the initial visit and during the follow-up period, in order to promptly detect any potential alteration in food behavior.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, they noted that given the limited research on the top, there is 'still a significant knowledge gap'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'A better understanding of food behavior among cancer patients and survivors is of paramount importance to provide appropriate and multi-professional healthcare support,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over 40 years ago, Dr Thurstan Brewin of the Glasgow Institute of Oncology reported that one in four of his patients described how months before being diagnosed, they had seemingly inexplicably lost their appetite for a previously favoured food or drink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For one, tea became 'most unpleasant’, another said cheese tasted 'like chewing gum’, while a third reported that sausages became 'leathery’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But such cravings would disappear once treated for their cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.clinicalradiologyonline.net/article/S0009-9260(82)80323-1/fulltext"&gt;Clinical Radiology&lt;/a&gt;, he said: 'Spontaneous return to normal is quite common in cases triggered by tumour treatment, but rare in cases starting before diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 40 years ago, Dr Thurstan Brewin of the Glasgow Institute of Oncology reported that one in four of his patients described how months before being diagnosed, they had seemingly inexplicably lost their appetite for a previously favoured food or drink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the orange-yellow stains on the lab coats slung on hooks hint at a less-usual subject matter under study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The powdery stain is pollen: microscopic grains containing male reproductive cells that trees, weeds and grasses &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/the-five-most-common-seasonal-allergies" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/the-five-most-common-seasonal-allergies"&gt;release seasonally&lt;/a&gt;. But Cho isn't studying irksome effects like hay fever, or what pollen means for the plants that make it. Instead, the material scientist has spent a decade pioneering and refining techniques to remodel pollen's rigid outer shell — made of a polymer so tough it's sometimes called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-diamond-of-the-plant-world-helped-land-plants-evolve-20220719/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-diamond-of-the-plant-world-helped-land-plants-evolve-20220719/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;"the diamond of the plant world"&lt;/a&gt; — transforming the grains to a jam-like consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0f587a72-0361-429b-9baf-bcb5022ed5af-2"&gt;This microgel, Cho believes, could be a versatile building block for many eco-friendly materials, including paper, film and sponges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f3244f31-b7c0-4048-80bb-7b3e46fa3b20"&gt;A lot of people think of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/butterfly-migration-pollen-tracking" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/butterfly-migration-pollen-tracking" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, when it's not fertilizing plants or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/insects/how-do-insects-know-which-flowers-have-pollen" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/insects/how-do-insects-know-which-flowers-have-pollen"&gt;feeding insects&lt;/a&gt;, as useless dust, but it has valuable applications if you know how to work with it,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says Cho, who coauthored an overview of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-101121-085959" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-101121-085959" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;pollen's prospective applications&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024 &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering&lt;/em&gt;. He's not the only scientist to think so. Noemi Csaba, a nanotechnology and drug delivery researcher at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, wants to develop hollowed-out pollen shells into protective vehicles to deliver drugs to the eyes, lungs and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studying pollen's usefulness to people are a rare breed, Csaba says. "I find it a bit surprising," she says. "Pollen is a very, very interesting biomaterial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/new-wonder-material-designed-by-ai-is-as-light-as-foam-but-as-strong-as-steel" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/new-wonder-material-designed-by-ai-is-as-light-as-foam-but-as-strong-as-steel"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New wonder material designed by AI is as light as foam but as strong as steel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a4f81009-de92-4f24-9254-c697a149bf0b" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="softening-the-shell-3"&gt;Softening the shell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="740472c1-dbdb-4ca2-b6e7-4904368ab305"&gt;To begin working with pollen, scientists can remove the sticky coating around the grains in a process called defatting. Stripping away these lipids and allergenic proteins is the first step in creating the empty capsules for drug delivery that Csaba seeks. Beyond that, however, pollen's seemingly impenetrable shell — made up of the biopolymer sporopollenin — had long stumped researchers and limited its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jj2MJSEC3C75e7TpYmvezC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jj2MJSEC3C75e7TpYmvezC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough came in 2020, when Cho and his team reported that incubating pollen in an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide at 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit) could &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1283570300103064632&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-15294-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Ftechnology%2Fscientists-propose-using-pollen-to-make-paper-and-sponges" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15294-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-15294-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Ftechnology%2Fscientists-propose-using-pollen-to-make-paper-and-sponges" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;significantly alter the surface chemistry of pollen grains&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to readily absorb and retain water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting pollen is as pliable as Play-Doh, says Shahrudin Ibrahim, a research fellow in Cho's lab who helped to develop the technique. Before the treatment, pollen grains are more like marbles: hard, inert and largely unreactive. After, the particles are so soft they stick together easily, allowing more complex structures to form. This opens up numerous applications, Ibrahim says, proudly holding up a vial of the yellow-brown slush in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cast onto a flat mold and dried out, the microgel assembles into a paper or film, depending on the final thickness, that is strong yet flexible. It is also sensitive to external stimuli, including changes in pH and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922560117" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922560117" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt;. Exposure to the alkaline solution causes pollen's constituent polymers to become more hydrophilic, or water-loving, so depending on the conditions, the gel will swell or shrink due to the absorption or expulsion of water, explains Ibrahim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9dda74ef-d0b7-441f-995e-10f959f80fee"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;For technical applications, pollen grains are first stripped of their allergy-inducing sticky coating, in a process called defatting. Next, if treated with acid, they form hollow sporopollenin capsules that can be used to deliver drugs. If treated instead with an alkaline solution, the defatted pollen grains are transformed into a soft microgel that can be used to make thin films, paper and sponges. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Knowable Magazine, &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;CC BY-ND&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="134804bd-6bce-45cd-955f-e5424090f85f"&gt;This winning combination of properties, the Singaporean researchers believe, makes pollen-based film a prospect for many future applications: smart actuators that allow devices to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/admt.202200446" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/admt.202200446" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;wearable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211285517302173" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211285517302173" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;health trackers&lt;/a&gt; to monitor heart signals, and more. And because pollen is naturally UV-protective, there's the possibility it could &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202100566" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202100566" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;substitute&lt;/a&gt; for certain photonically active substrates in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cho's lab has also demonstrated that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35289432/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35289432/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;paper made from pollen can be printed on&lt;/a&gt;. It may be a sustainable alternative to traditional paper for writing, printing and packaging, according to Cho, who has patented the microgel's production process. Producing traditional paper destroys trees and is resource-intensive, requiring &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/the-green-and-blue-water-footprint-of-paper-products-methodologic" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/the-green-and-blue-water-footprint-of-paper-products-methodologic" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;up to 13 liters of water&lt;/a&gt; for every page made. Pollen is naturally released in bulk from seed-producing plants, and deriving paper from it requires only a few simple steps. Ink can be removed with a simple alkaline solution wash — a process that lets the paper be reused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, freeze-dried pollen microgel forms porous sponges. These could be made into such things as scaffolds for tissue engineering, or used to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202311684" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202311684" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;stem bleeding&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202101091" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202101091" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;absorb oil spills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cho's team usually works with sunflower and camellia pollen that they purchase inexpensively as a bee pollen mixture, mainly from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. But they say their alkaline hydrolysis method would work well with a broad swath of plant species. Pollen is abundant, Cho adds — a single floret of the common sunflower, for instance, produces&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=403104#:~:text=Pollen%20quantity%20(%CB%9C%2025%2C000%E2%80%9367%2C000%20grains%20per%20floret),quantity%20were%20unrelated%20to%20pollen%20grain%20size." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=403104#:~:text=Pollen%20quantity%20(%CB%9C%2025%2C000%E2%80%9367%2C000%20grains%20per%20floret),quantity%20were%20unrelated%20to%20pollen%20grain%20size." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; 25,000 to 67,000 grains&lt;/a&gt; every summer. Moreover, it's easy to collect from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/how-do-bees-make-honey" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/how-do-bees-make-honey"&gt;bees&lt;/a&gt; in commercial hives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c9efc272-59c1-4255-bbee-383620bf3999"&gt;Pollen-based products have some way to go before reaching the market, Ibrahim adds; the key right now is to predict challenges and devise sustainable solutions. With other biomaterials researchers are working on, such as chitosan and cellulose, a crustacean or a tree must be destroyed. Compared with that, pollen is considerably less resource-intensive: "We're not destroying the plant," he says.

In one phase, they consumed nitrate-rich beetroot juice (a.k.a. beet juice) daily. In the second phase, people consumed a placebo version of the drink with nitrates removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with nitrates, they're compounds of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="nitrogen and oxygen" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;nitrogen and oxygen&lt;/a&gt; that occur naturally in the soil, water, vegetables, and processed meats.

The researchers also used bacterial gene sequencing to find microbes that were in the participants’ mouths before and after each treatment phase. They took blood pressure readings, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Researchers ultimately found that participants' oral microbiome changed dramatically after they consumed the nitrate-rich beet juice, but there were differences between the older and younger groups. The older group experienced a noticeable drop in the oral bacteria Prevotella after drinking beet juice, as well as an increase in good oral bacteria, like Neisseria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The older group initially had higher average blood pressure readings at the beginning of the study, but their blood pressure dropped after they had the nitrate-rich beetroot juice. (But not after they had the placebo drink.)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-beets-help-lower-blood-pressure" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;How do beets help lower blood pressure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This isn’t the first study to link beets to lower blood pressure. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="scientific analysis" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 found that people saw an improvement in their blood pressure consuming 70 milliliters, 140 milliliters, and 250 milliliters (about a cup) of beet juice a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="analysis" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2024 found that there was a “significant effect” on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) up to 90 days after participants had a daily dose of beet juice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But…why? Well, it's a slightly complicated process. “Beets contain nitrates which are converted to nitrites by good bacteria in the mouth,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonya Angelone, RDN," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco. “The nitrites-rich saliva is swallowed, where it is converted to nitric oxide in the stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That nitric oxide is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it helps blood vessels relax and widen, in a process called vasodilation, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cheng-Han Chen, MD" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. "This process improves blood pressure," he says.  &lt;br data-node-id="16.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The bacteria in your mouth matters, too. "Without the right balance of good bacteria in your mouth, the conversion of the nitrates in beets can’t happen, so you won't get the blood pressure-lowering effects from beets or beet root juice," says Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://80twentynutrition.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="80 Twenty Nutrition." data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt; "Eating a diet that is high in inorganic nitrates from beets and green leafy vegetables also seems to prevent the growth of unhealthy bacteria in the mouth, which could also help to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-other-health-benefits-do-beets-have" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;What other health benefits do beets have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Beets actually have a lot going for them outside of blood pressure. They're also a good source of fiber "which is good for digestion and gut health,” Angelone says. And they contain antioxidants which can help reduce inflammation and lower your risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Not only that, beets contain folate and potassium, which are good for heart health. “They may also support athletic performance by enhancing the mitochondrial function, the energy producing structure in the cells,” Angelone says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-should-i-be-eating-to-reap-the-benefits" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;How much should I be eating to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To get the health benefits from beets, it’s good to eat about a cup of the veggie nearly every day, Angelone says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, if you have high blood pressure, Brissette says it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the lifestyle moves you’re making to try to get that blood pressure back down. Also, keep in mind that beets or beet juice aren’t designed to replace any blood pressure-lowering medication you may be on—but they can support your efforts, per Dr. Chen.

But both chemophobia and the appeal to nature fallacy are central to pseudoscience, the anti-vaccine movement and the MAHA wellness industry, Love noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of chemophobia and appeal to nature fallacy is also a “romanticization of ancestral living, when, in reality, we lived very poorly, we died very young and often suffering and in pain,” Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going back to simpler times” are talking points for both MAHA and MAGA, which, of course, stands for “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that alludes to the past.

We turn not only to words like “good” or “bad,” but also “toxin-free,” “natural” and “clean,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing these words slapped on a jar of nut butter, on a shampoo bottle, or on sunscreen makes making the “right choice” easier, he added — “even though the evidence does not support what’s implied by those words, those ‘health halos,’” noted Caulfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words are an “oversimplification,” Hardy said. “People now leverage their social media presence to share those oversimplified nutrition messages, most of which are at best, wrong, at worst, harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemophobia is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to escape. It’s even built into marketing campaigns and product names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever fallen into the chemophobia trap without knowing, you aren’t alone. It’s complicated and nuanced, and the science is, at times, messy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, chemophobia is the inspiration behind brand names and entire product categorizations; “clean beauty” is one huge example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears of chemicals are now marketing ploys. “You’re going to find products that claim that they’re ‘chemical-free,’ and that doesn’t exist,” Love said, referring to the fact that, once again, everything is made up of chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market forces take over and cling to the chemophobia buzz words of the moment, whether that’s “clean” “gluten-free” or “non-GMO,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have Triscuits labeled with non-GMO marketing, he said. We also have entire product lines at stores like Sephora that are categorized as “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It creates this perception [of] ‘if that one’s chemical-free, then the alternative that isn’t labeled as such must be dangerous, must be bad,’” Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, making the “good” choice easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t to say there isn’t room for improvement in the health and food space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work in the public health space. I don’t know a single public health researcher, a single agricultural researcher, a single biomedical researcher who doesn’t want to make our food environment safer for everyone,” said Caulfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because Caulfield speaks out against chemophobia doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to make our food and health environment healthier, he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think we should always be challenging both industry and government to do exactly that, but at the same time, we have to be realistic and understand the nature of the risks and the magnitude of risks at play,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both our food environment and agricultural practices could be safer, “but those moves should be based on what the science says, and not on slogans,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate greed and capitalism hinder these safety changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The huge irony here ... the answer to all of these chemophobia concerns ... it’s more government regulation. It’s more robust, science-informed regulation. And in this political environment, that ain’t going to happen, That just simply isn’t going to happen, as we’ve already seen,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-trump-climate_n_688915f0e4b07dfa117e329f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="repeal environmental protections" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af1b19e4b0bbcc3f8d48a5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="688915f0e4b07dfa117e329f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;repeal environmental protections&lt;/a&gt;

If your 2024 goals include plans to drink in moderation, here’s what she wants you to know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How 1-2 Alcoholic Drinks Per Day Impact The Body In Your 20s, 30s And 40s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your 20s, Landsverk says, are a resilient time for the body — which is probably why hangovers aren’t nearly as bad during that decade. “The liver and brain have the most resilience during that time,” she said. “The frontal lobes (reasoning, and judgment) are not quite developed. One is more likely to be open to drinking more or taking more risks, and this can set habits that will cause problems down the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You probably won’t notice a huge difference as you head into your 30s as long as you’re drinking moderately, but it’s important to keep your overall health in mind. “Ask yourself: How is your health otherwise? Obesity, which is epidemic in America, increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver,” Landsverk said. “Alcohol increases the risk of liver disease and scarring (cirrhosis). As a geriatrician, I would say a glass or two a week is fine. Some doctors say one drink a day is fine, but it is also neurotoxic and that can catch up with you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 40s, more health risks begin to pop up, Landsverk explains. “Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol all increase the risk for heart attacks, strokes and small stroke dementia,” she said. If you’re living with any of these conditions, even a small amount of alcohol can further increase your risk of events like heart attacks or strokes, so keep that in mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How 1-2 Alcoholic Drinks Impact The Body In Your 50s And 60s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy. I can ski or swim a mile, but a glass of wine makes me feel ill and slow the next day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This, she says, is because older people are more likely to lose the enzyme to metabolize alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase). “At this point, I can tolerate about one glass a week,” Landsverk noted. “If I had it daily, I would feel sick with just one glass a day. Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys. The damage to the brain from even one glass a day is worse [when you’re over 60].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Landsverk suggests that you think of alcoholic beverages like candy bars. “They’re nice with some meals, but they can increase your weight and blood sugar, and over decades adds to cancer risk and chronic illnesses that can lead to poor health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

No, Landsverk emphasizes, and it’s important to remember to remember that other factors influence the impact alcohol has on your health and well-being, such as if you’re living with a disease like obesity or hypertension. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re older and in generally good health, you shouldn’t worry too much about the occasional alcoholic beverage. That’s certainly the case for Landsverk. “I have decided that a glass of wine with a nice meal is worth it,” she said. “But not every night.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>孩子们可能会死：将俄亥俄州的vax率暴跌归咎于反疫苗特朗普政府- Cleveland.com</title><link>https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/09/kids-could-die-blame-anti-vaccine-trump-administration-for-ohios-plummeting-vax-rates.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FQ2ES2BQS5GVTIHP5XHXAVGVBY"&gt;An alarming decline in childhood vaccination rates, resulting from anti-science rhetoric, likely means a resurgence of deadly preventable diseases, and the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EJlQHL4SeRaVnbUzByClJ?si=04c32f69736341fc" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EJlQHL4SeRaVnbUzByClJ?si=04c32f69736341fc"&gt;Today in Ohio&lt;/a&gt; podcast crew suggests that only the firing of Robert F.

The decline represents thousands of Ohio children now vulnerable to diseases that had been largely controlled through routine immunization—a public health achievement that the podcast hosts fear is being undermined by politically motivated misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ULINIMOHZJESPPYTSS27WIJDIU"&gt;“Our child mortality rate’s going to go up in America,” said Chris Quinn. “There’s no doubt about it.
