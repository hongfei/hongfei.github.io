			&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;issued an urgent warning&lt;/a&gt; about tianeptine – a substance marketed as a dietary supplement but known on the street as "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;overdoses and deaths&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7304a5.htm?s_cid=mm7304a5_w"&gt;being sold&lt;/a&gt; in petrol stations, smoke shops and online retailers, despite never being approved for medical use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is tianeptine, and why is it causing alarm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-issues-eye-drops-warning-after-deadly-outbreak-of-bacterial-infections?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA Issues Eye Drops Warning After Deadly Outbreak of Bacterial Infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40122-023-00539-5"&gt;Tianeptine&lt;/a&gt; was developed in France in the 1960s and approved for medical use in the late 1980s as a &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_J2ti4EkYpkC&amp;amp;pg=PA3222"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structurally, it resembles tricyclic antidepressants – an older class of antidepressant – but pharmacologically it behaves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4119213/"&gt;very differently&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike conventional antidepressants, which typically increase serotonin levels, tianeptine appears to act on the brain's glutamate system, which is involved in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used as a prescription drug in some European, Asian and Latin American countries under brand names &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11587517/"&gt;like Stablon or Coaxil&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25026323/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; later discovered something unusual, tianeptine also activates the brain's &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0225-3"&gt;mu-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, the same receptors targeted by morphine and heroin – hence it's nickname "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A box of Stablon pills." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As a prescription drug, tianeptine is sold under various brand names, including Stablon. (IllusionalFate/&lt;a class="source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26786285"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At prescribed doses, the effect is subtle, but in large amounts, tianeptine can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;euphoria, sedation and eventually dependence&lt;/a&gt;. People chasing a high might take doses far beyond anything recommended in medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite never being approved by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-select-dietary-supplement-ingredients-and-other-substances/tianeptine-dietary-supplements"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, the drug is sold in the US as a "wellness" product or nootropic – a substance supposedly used to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;enhance mood or mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;. It's packaged as capsules, powders or liquids, often misleadingly labelled as dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This loophole has enabled companies to circumvent regulation. Products like Neptune's Fix have been promoted as safe and legal alternatives to traditional medications, despite lacking any clinical oversight and often containing unlisted or dangerous ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some samples have even been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300852/"&gt;synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs&lt;/a&gt;. According to US poison control data, calls related to tianeptine exposure rose by over &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39724478/"&gt;500% between 2018 and 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;In 2024 alone&lt;/a&gt;, the drug was involved in more than 300 poisoning cases. The FDA's latest advisory included product recalls and import warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have taken to the social media site Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingTianeptine/"&gt;including a dedicated channel&lt;/a&gt;, and other forums to describe their experiences, both the highs and the grim withdrawals. Some report taking hundreds of pills a day. Others struggle to quit, describing cravings and relapses that mirror those seen with classic opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since tianeptine doesn't show up in standard toxicology screenings, health professionals &lt;a href="https://keystonelab.com/tianeptine/tianeptine-drug-testing-guidelines/"&gt;may not recognise it&lt;/a&gt;. According to doctors in North America, it could be present in hospital patients without being detected, particularly in cases involving &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;seizures or unusual heart symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People report experiencing withdrawal symptoms that resemble those of opioids, like &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/fentanyl/"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6730a2.htm"&gt;anxiety, tremors, insomnia, diarrhoea and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;. Some have been hospitalised due to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;seizures, loss of consciousness and respiratory depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UK legality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, tianeptine is not licensed for medical use by the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&lt;/a&gt; and it is not classified as a controlled substance under the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&lt;/a&gt;. That puts it in a legal grey area, not formally approved, but not illegal to possess either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be bought online from overseas vendors, and a quick search reveals dozens of sellers offering "research-grade" powder and capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little evidence that tianeptine is circulating widely in the UK; to date, just one confirmed sample has been publicly recorded in a national drug testing &lt;a href="https://www.wedinos.org/"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;. It's not mentioned in recent Home Office or Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;briefings&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not appear in official crime or hospital statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may simply reflect the fact that no one is looking for it. Without testing protocols in place, it could be present, just unrecorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of its &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Tianeptine"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt; and unusual effects, if tianeptine did show up in a UK emergency department, it could easily be mistaken for a tricyclic antidepressant overdose, or even dismissed as recreational drug use. This makes it harder to diagnose and treat appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible, particularly among people seeking alternatives to harder-to-access opioids, or those looking for a legal high. With its low visibility, online availability and potential for addiction, tianeptine ticks many of the same boxes that once made drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/mcat-meow-meow-drug-2024-young-people-london-raves-b1185517.html"&gt;mephedrone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/synthetic-cannabinoids/"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt; popular before they were banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has seen waves of novel psychoactive substances emerge through similar routes, first appearing online or in head shops, then spreading quietly until authorities &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-uk-has-banned-drugs-that-dont-even-exist-yet-psychoactive-substances-act/"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. If tianeptine follows the same path, by the time it appears on the radar, harm may already be underway.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259194/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

While medications and lifestyle play a vital role, adding a single vegetable can naturally improve blood sugar control, even for those with diabetes. A new study found that eating a certain vegetable has been linked to improved blood sugar levels in prediabetes, a precursor to type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted at the University of Gothenburg found that a compound in broccoli has a more significant effect on blood sugar levels in certain people. The study is published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01932-w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Broccoli’s role in managing blood sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, is an antidiabetic agent in type 2 diabetes. A study conducted in 2017 found reduced &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-10-smart-fruit-choices-to-help-manage-blood-sugar-levels/photostory/122145614.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in people with diabetes after they took large doses of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprouts. The new study looked at the impact of this compound in controlling blood sugar in people with prediabetes. This condition is a precursor to type 2 diabetes, with slowly rising blood sugar levels due to impaired insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 89 people with elevated fasting blood sugar, a sign of prediabetes. They were all between 35 and 75 years old and were either overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly given either sulforaphane or a placebo for 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither they nor the researchers knew who got what. By the end, 74 people completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Significant change in fasting blood sugar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were striking. The participants, who consumed the sulforaphane compound had a higher average reduction in fasting blood sugar than those who didn’t. In some participants, the results were even more prominent. Certain participants had more benefits. The group with the greatest improvement after taking sulforaphane had early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively low BMI in the context of the study, low insulin resistance, low incidence of fatty liver disease, and low insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Possible precision treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes affects millions of people across the world, and there is no clear treatment structure currently in place. This is because the condition often remains undetected. Early detection increases the chances of not developing type 2 diabetes. Anders Rosengren stressed the importance of early and individualized interventions to prevent the disease. The treatment of prediabetes is currently lacking in many respects, but these new findings open the way for possible precision treatment using sulforaphane extracted from broccoli as a functional food. However, lifestyle factors remain the foundation of any treatment for prediabetes, including exercise, healthy eating, and weight loss. The results of the study also offer a general model of how pathophysiology and gut flora interact with and influence treatment responses. A model that could have broader implications," Anders Rosengren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Kheera for weight loss: 5 reasons to eat cucumber with every meal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxNOWpkM0p2dHAwMHJQem5aVE5zNHpqcFN5akhtZXowT1NWbkNjTDVlTUtiREhpekR5OHIzWGlqbFAyOHFlbFVSei1NY01hVW5rQXNjMnEyUDF0VnphTnBQTFRTd2ZsZWphbUxhQUlEdmhFZ1JNbkpLcE9QMDJ5VzdvVkU5VC10RXVRSmE1RTZsLTFqQjNMV1FiMTZtSGp0aWNteEpCNEkzdUVxS3c1WElJRFh1OWRVanp2M2lkU3BSRl9iekpJdE9XWDZBLVZKREJudXQwV0t2SW9uYnZXU3NEbmJiaC04ZV85VDRvNEstQkZOOG1hWXhBclBzN204SWZMOUt1X2tUdy1ZOE1ETV9V</guid></item><item><title>新型糖尿病现已得到官方认可，并与营养不足有关- Earth.com | New type of diabetes is now officially recognized and linked to nutritional deficiencies - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbGJmakNMd2pDR1JobmtpTzdOWnp4d19nYkI3ekZQNmpDT2ZlREpJSkJnM1BycHNhVVBxZkNKWVZieXZ6aG5GdU1sWU5JdnlFQXN3b090QmtxZWFfSkN0d00zQ1BWVWhiZFhpeVFGdHlfUnBuRWJjYVl6bjVBOVhMS1hfckw0TllJQjhIZ3h2SGxSU2pBYzVZeUMzbGdVQV9FdWY3SW1Nclo2TWJWcDJwYkdFWXd3QWJzcURv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes is no longer a footnote. On April 9, 2025 the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Diabetes Federation&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that chronic undernutrition can seed a very different form of blood‑sugar trouble, giving the condition its own place in the global classification system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Malnutrition‑related diabetes has historically been vastly under‑diagnosed and poorly understood,” said Dr. Meredith Hawkins as the vote was announced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins is an endocrinologist at &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Albert Einstein College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and founding director of the Global Diabetes Institute (&lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/centers/global-health/global-diabetes-institute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GDI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-a-fifth-type-matters"&gt;Why a fifth type matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in nine adults worldwide now lives with some form of diabetes, and more than 250 million people remain unaware of their status, according to the 11th edition of the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/idf-diabetes-atlas-11th-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF Diabetes Atlas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most public campaigns focus on type 2 diabetes, yet an estimated 20 to 25 million lean adolescents and young adults in Asia and Africa carry the new diagnosis of type 5, a burden comparable in size to HIV infection in the same regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike type 2, type 5 takes hold where food is scarce, not plentiful. That reality undercuts a long‑standing public narrative that ties &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; exclusively to over‑nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For governments counting every healthcare dollar, a distinct label matters. Budgets follow labels, and without one, entire populations have slipped through screening and treatment programs designed for very different metabolic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is about equity, science, and saving lives,” said &lt;a href="https://idf.org/who-we-are/our-structure/board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Peter Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;, president of the IDF, summing up the stakes during the Bangkok congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-hunger-leaves-a-lasting-mark"&gt;Early hunger leaves a lasting mark&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of animal work show that a low‑protein diet during gestation or adolescence stunts pancreatic growth and the formation of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10046343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta cells&lt;/a&gt;, the tiny factories that make insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human epidemiology echoes that biology, linking low birth weight and recurring childhood malnutrition to impaired glucose control later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now group type 5 under &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/69/10/2086/16081/Subtypes-of-Type-2-Diabetes-Determined-From" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;severe insulin‑deficient diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, a label that captures the core defect: the pancreas never learned to keep up with sugar loads, even though the rest of the body remains sensitive to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South India, investigators tracked adults whose body‑mass index averaged just 18.3 kg/m² yet whose blood sugar routinely soared; birth‑weight records, where available, pointed to under‑nutrition in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community nutrition programs are therefore viewed not only as anti‑hunger measures but also as long‑range &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health economists note a secondary benefit. Feed a girl properly before and during pregnancy, and her children may avoid the same metabolic trap, breaking an expensive inter‑generational cycle of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State‑of‑the‑art euglycemic clamp &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/6/1428/146920/An-Atypical-Form-of-Diabetes-Among-Individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022, confirmed that type 5 patients secrete dramatically less insulin than matched controls while showing normal or even heightened insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same work found little &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and modest liver fat, a stark contrast to type 2 profiles. In practical terms, these young adults do not carry the metabolic baggage that fuels insulin resistance in obesity‑driven diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.testing.com/tests/autoantibodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autoantibody screens&lt;/a&gt; stay negative, ruling out the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5723426/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune‑mediated beta‑cell destruction&lt;/a&gt; that defines type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers therefore line up: glucose levels look dangerous, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-peptide-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C‑peptide&lt;/a&gt; looks scant, but inflammatory markers typical of autoimmunity are absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the pancreas is small, many experts suspect that oral drugs that nudge the remaining beta cells may help more than high‑dose insulin injections, a strategy that could lower costs and reduce dangerous hypoglycemia in food‑insecure settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diabetes-type-causes-clinical-confusion"&gt;Diabetes type causes clinical confusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis,” Dr. Hawkins warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger clinicians, trained on the obesity paradigm, may reach for large insulin doses that push already fragile patients into &lt;a href="https://karger.com/gel/article-abstract/86/4/535/358345/The-Etiologic-Factors-in-the-Causation-of?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ulcerating hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misclassification also skews surveillance data. When a thin teenager in rural Uganda shows up with elevated glucose but no &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/keto-diet-promotes-fat-loss-but-potentially-wrecks-your-health/"&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, the chart often reads “type 1,” obscuring the true epidemiology and directing precious insulin supplies away from those who need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 commentary in the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/bjem/pages/currenttoc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bangladesh Journal of Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphasized the threat: standard insulin regimens carry “potentially fatal consequences” for type 5 patients who are mis‑typed as type 1, because even small dosing errors provoke sharp glucose crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple screening cues can help. A BMI below 19 kg/m² in the absence of autoantibodies should prompt consideration of type 5, especially when the history includes prolonged childhood hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-for-care-of-diabetes-type-5"&gt;Steps for care of diabetes type 5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after the Bangkok vote, the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; launched a dedicated working group to write diagnostic criteria, compile treatment algorithms, and build an international patient registry by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel, co‑chaired by Hawkins and &lt;a href="https://www.cmcendovellore.org/nihal-thomas-php/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Nihal Thoma&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href="https://www.cmch-vellore.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christian Medical College&lt;/a&gt; in Vellore, India, will test low‑dose insulin, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513225/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sulfonylureas&lt;/a&gt;, and structured nutrition programs in multi‑site trials. Results could reshape essential‑medicine lists in low‑income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health agencies are already modeling the economic impact. Analysts predict that shifting even half of misdiagnosed cases from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; vials to oral drugs could save tens of millions of dollars each year, funds that might be redirected to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fathers-have-a-surprising-influence-on-their-babys-birth-weight/"&gt;maternal nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates also press for the inclusion of pancreas‑focused imaging in major nutrition cohorts. Measuring organ size early could identify high‑risk children before glucose spirals out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are taking decisive steps to correct this,” said Schwarz, insisting that momentum will continue. Policies built on that momentum will decide whether type 5 becomes another silent killer or a preventable relic of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/bjem/fulltext/2025/05000/type_5_diabetes_mellitus__global_recognition_of_a.1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 22:11:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbGJmakNMd2pDR1JobmtpTzdOWnp4d19nYkI3ekZQNmpDT2ZlREpJSkJnM1BycHNhVVBxZkNKWVZieXZ6aG5GdU1sWU5JdnlFQXN3b090QmtxZWFfSkN0d00zQ1BWVWhiZFhpeVFGdHlfUnBuRWJjYVl6bjVBOVhMS1hfckw0TllJQjhIZ3h2SGxSU2pBYzVZeUMzbGdVQV9FdWY3SW1Nclo2TWJWcDJwYkdFWXd3QWJzcURv</guid></item><item><title>神秘的麻风病原体在美洲潜伏了4000年- ScienceAlert | Mysterious Leprosy Pathogen Has Lurked in The Americas For 4,000 Years - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZzIyTEVOb1lZOTVfNFo5MXBlTWFGcTJ4bzhwQWMxeHhITjM5NURRYk9XdThIdnBlMmRROUlmYmJLQ1FOZ3BlbFQ2YnllelFKemdGQ0psYTZSM0pZTlJOSVdidGNhX2VITVFMME9pdlVuRTZpNUY0TFE2TzF4Nm1SU19fUFJjRFFoRVBlb1FMdnk3VE1KZFB4My1oeFU1Wms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt; was circulating in Chile some 4,000 years ago, meaning the disease arrived in the Americas much earlier than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on an analysis of ancient bones and teeth by researchers from institutions in Germany, Argentina, and Chile, and it challenges &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-01120-2"&gt;the conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that leprosy was a disease introduced by European settlers from the 16th century onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a comprehensive study of DNA fragments found in two human skeletons, the researchers were able to match the genetic material to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_lepromatosis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pathogen – the less common of two bacteria known to cause leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were initially suspicious, since leprosy is regarded as a colonial-era disease, but more careful evaluation of the DNA revealed the pathogen to be of the lepromatosis form," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Darío Ramirez, from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-warn-leprosy-isnt-ancient-history-as-cases-surge-in-the-us?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Experts Warn Leprosy Isn't Ancient History as Cases Surge in The US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still learning about &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;, which has only recently been identified. Another bacteria, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the dominant strain behind leprosy, and its history and spread has been more clearly mapped to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's a scarcity of samples in the Americas, &lt;em&gt;M. leprae&lt;/em&gt; has been tracked back &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185966"&gt;for thousands of years&lt;/a&gt; across Eurasia, which is part of the reason why researchers have long thought it traveled from Europe across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166422" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166422" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull.jpg" alt="Leprosy skull" class="wp-image-166422 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166422" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found tiny traces of bacteria in human remains.

This new find, pushing its arrival back millennia earlier, adds further evidence that we need to rethink the history of leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ancient DNA has become a great tool that allows us to dig deeper into diseases that have had a long history in the Americas," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Kirsten Bos, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The advanced techniques now used to study ancient pathogen DNA allows us to look beyond the suspects and into other diseases that might not be expected from the context."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to pick apart this history of disease isn't easy. Indigenous American peoples would certainly have had afflictions of their own, but they would have also been hit hard by infections &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-pottery-reveals-trade-networks-in-australia-long-before-colonization"&gt;imported by colonists&lt;/a&gt; – infections their bodies were poorly prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident that there's more to the story, in terms of both modern and ancient forms of the disease – especially in regards to &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;. Each archaeological dig and clinical test gives experts more genomes to work with, which then further helps our understanding of disease history, spread, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemics-seem-to-have-made-a-comeback-why-is-this-happening"&gt;and diversification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the skill needed by researchers is knowing what to look for, which is highlighted by this study – previous work in this area may have missed ancient markers of leprosy, simply because no one thought to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This disease was present in Chile as early as 4,000 years ago, and now that we know it was there, we can specifically look for it in other contexts," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Rodrigo Nores, from the National University of Córdoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-025-02771-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By June 27, 10 attendees - all of whom had eaten the salad - had sought treatment at one of two hospitals in Fresno County (five patients at each hospital) for symptoms resembling those of botulism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-95436990-590f-11f0-9a09-150b0fdb8864"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the Fresno County Department of Public Health and California Department of Public Health launched an investigation to discover the cause of the widespread illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After days of lab testing, officials were ultimately able to discover that the uncooked nopales present in the salad - which had been left unrefrigerated in 100 degree Fahrenheit heat and served on both days - was contaminated with C botulinum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, eight of the 10 patients were diagnosed with the condition - marking it as one of the largest documented foodborne outbreaks of the infection in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-94ed88c0-590c-11f0-9a09-150b0fdb8864" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight people were hospitalized in California after eating a homemade salad made of uncooked nopales that was contaminated with C botulinum - a deadly neurotoxin that can cause paralysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nopales, a popular food in traditional Mexican dishes also known as prickly pear cactus, has recently gained popularity in dishes as a healthy ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials confirmed that one of the eight patients had made the salad using fresh onions, fresh tomatoes and home-preserved nopales stored in reused commercial glass jars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC case report, the salad-maker had immersed empty jars into boiling water and then added chopped, uncooked nopales mixed with a small amount of salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once stuffed to the brim, she sealed the jars with new metal lids and stored them for six weeks in an outdoor shed behind her house - a technique she said she had been practicing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she was unaware that she had created the perfect breeding ground for C botulinum spores as they thrive in a low-oxygen, low-acid, canned environment with moderate to high moisture and temperatures between 38F and 113F to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norma Sanchez, communicable disease specialist with Fresno County Department of Public Health, later said they identified the contaminated cactus after sifting through trash cans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spores of this bacteria &lt;span&gt;are often found on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables and in seafood and, in this case, rapidly grew on the surface of the uncooked and canned nopales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All eight patients diagnosed with botulism had double vision, seven had a hoarse voice, six were experiencing dizziness and six also found it difficult to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eight patients with clinical botulism were the only attendees who ate the nopales salad; the 42-year-old woman, who experienced the most severe symptoms, ate this item at both events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Once stuffed to the brim, she sealed the jars with new metal lids and stored them for six weeks in an outdoor shed behind her house - a technique she had been practicing for years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight of the 10 patients were diagnosed with botulism caused by C botulinum - marking it as one of the largest documented foodborne outbreaks of the infection in California &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, all of the patients had to stay at the hospital for between two and 42 days - out of which six were admitted to an intensive care unit and two required invasive mechanical ventilation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC later confirmed in its case report that all the people diagnosed with botulism had survived and recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Botulism is a rare but serious infection caused by a bacterial toxin that attacks the nervous system and is mostly commonly a result of food or wound contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of botulism include difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, double vision, drooping eyelids, blurry vision, slurred speech, difficulty breathing, and trouble moving the eyes, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of foodborne botulism, these symptoms of typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the body depending on the level of exposure to the toxin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, the infection can cause muscle weakness, paralysis and in certain cases, death. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who are paralyzed need to relearn how to walk, talk, and perform everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates that there are just 25 cases of foodborne botulism in the US each year, making it rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five percent of people who develop botulism die, according to the CDC. For others, it can cause lifelong disability and extreme physical therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fresno health department is urging people to follow proper storing and cooking methods to lower their risk of botulism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Any food at risk of contamination should be heated up to 240–250F, and heated all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth.

That 11 percent is a significant increase.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from the University of Kansas have found that consuming creatine as a supplement in any form can help improve memory and prevent Alzheimer's disease &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects older adults. About 7.2million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creatine supplements, typically priced about $2.40 per serving and taken by as many as 20million Americans, are usually bought by those looking to enhance athletic performance and muscle growth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are most commonly available in both capsules and powder form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the trial, 19 Alzheimer's patients were given 20g of creatine monohydrate, a powder they could mix into a beverage of their choice, every day for eight weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to experts, the standard dose of creatine recommended for people looking to boost their muscle strength and athletic performance is 5g per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But since natural creatine produced in the body goes to the muscles first and whatever remains trickles to the brain, researchers gave patients 20g in hopes more would travel there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants also underwent blood tests, MRI scans and took cognitive evaluations before taking the supplement, after four weeks and again after eight weeks to measure creatine levels and memory and cognitive improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along the 11 percent increase in brain creatine levels, results showed the participant's overall cognitive abilities, including attention, memory, language, and executive functions, slightly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, their capacity to think logically and problem-solve also increased marginally. The participants' ability to accurately and fluently read, as well as to pay attention to a singular object also showed significant improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to experts, the standard dose of creatine prescribed to people looking to boost their muscle strength and athletic performance is 5g per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors wrote: 'The cognitive improvements observed in this study are also promising, as Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease with expected decline over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hypothesized that memory and executive function, the most affected domains in Alzheimer's disease would benefit from creatine monohydrate supplementation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Matthew Taylor, assistant professor of dietetics and nutrition at KU School of Health Professions and lead author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's disease is believed to be caused by the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid protein molecules stick together in brain cells, forming clumps called plaques. While tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth.

Following a brief breathing exercise, participants in the study reported feeling less negative and less agitated when viewing unpleasant images. They also felt more capable of using mental strategies to intentionally change their emotional state, suggesting this simple technique can provide an immediate boost to emotional self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long understood that the ability to manage our emotions is a key component of mental well-being and coping with life’s challenges. When this ability is diminished, it is associated with a range of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. A complex, bidirectional relationship exists between stress and our capacity for emotional control. High levels of stress can impair our ability to regulate our feelings, and, conversely, poor emotional regulation can make us feel more stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This impairment happens through a specific biological pathway. When we experience stress, the body’s central stress response system, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, becomes activated and releases stress hormones like cortisol. These hormones can interfere with the brain’s higher-order thinking regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions like self-control and decision-making. This process effectively weakens the “top-down” control our thinking brain has over our more automatic emotional centers, making it harder to stay calm and rational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this connection, the researchers reasoned that if they could find a way to quiet the body’s stress response, it might free up the mental resources needed for effective emotional regulation. One promising method for doing this is slow-paced breathing. Deliberate, slow breathing has been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of our nervous system responsible for the “rest and digest” response that calms the body down. It achieves this by increasing the activity of the vagus nerve, a major nerve that helps regulate heart rate and other internal functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists behind this study sought to bridge a few gaps in existing research. While many studies have explored mindfulness, they often involve long-term training or simply ask participants to focus on their breath without deliberately slowing it. This study wanted to see if a single, very short session of intentionally slow breathing could have an immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, previous research often measured how breathing changed a person’s baseline emotional state, but did not test if it improved their ability to actively use a specific mental strategy, such as cognitive reappraisal—the technique of changing how you think about a situation to alter how you feel about it. Finally, the researchers wanted to test emotional flexibility by not only asking participants to reduce their negative feelings but also to intensify them, a less-studied aspect of emotional control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the research team conducted an experiment with 13 undergraduate students from a college in New England, with an average age of about 21 years. The study used a “within-subjects” design, which means that every participant took part in both the experimental condition and the control condition, allowing for a direct comparison of their performance under each circumstance. The two sessions were held online via video conference and were separated by one to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order in which participants completed the conditions was mixed to prevent any ordering effects. In both sessions, participants engaged in a cognitive reappraisal task. They were shown a series of emotionally negative pictures (such as images of accidents or violence) and some neutral pictures. Before each image appeared, they received an audio instruction to either “enhance,” “suppress,” or “maintain” their emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the “enhance” instruction, they were asked to use cognitive reappraisal to make their emotional response stronger, perhaps by imagining themselves or a loved one in the situation. For the “suppress” instruction, they were to use reappraisal to lessen their emotional response, for example, by thinking of the situation as fake or by focusing on a non-emotional detail. For “maintain,” they were told to simply view the image and let their feelings unfold naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference between the two sessions was the manipulation. In the control condition, participants moved directly to the picture task after a short break. In the slow-paced breathing condition, before starting the task, they were guided through a three-minute “box breathing” exercise. An on-screen animation instructed them to inhale for four seconds, hold their breath for three seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold for another three seconds, repeating this cycle for the full three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After viewing each picture, participants provided several ratings. Using a tool called the Self Assessment Manikin, which uses simple figures to depict feelings, they rated the picture’s valence (how pleasant or unpleasant it made them feel on a 9-point scale) and its arousal (how calm or excited it made them feel on a 9-point scale). They also rated their own performance on a 4-point scale, indicating how successful they felt they were at following the instruction to enhance, suppress, or maintain their emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breathing exercise had a direct effect on the participants’ emotional state. When instructed to simply “maintain” their reaction to negative images, participants in the slow-paced breathing condition rated the pictures as less negative and felt  calmer (less aroused) compared to their ratings in the control condition. This shows that the breathing exercise on its own served as an emotional buffer, toning down the immediate impact of the unpleasant stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting were the findings related to the active use of cognitive reappraisal. The most striking result came from the self-reported success ratings. In the control condition, without the breathing exercise, participants reported that they were significantly less successful at suppressing their negative emotions compared to enhancing or maintaining them. They felt they struggled to mentally distance themselves and reduce their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the slow-paced breathing condition, this struggle disappeared. Participants reported feeling equally successful at all three tasks: enhancing, maintaining, and suppressing their emotions. When directly comparing the two conditions, participants rated themselves as more successful at suppressing their emotional response to negative images after having completed the breathing exercise. This suggests that the breathing exercise subjectively improved their sense of control and their confidence in their ability to manage their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the breathing exercise helped individuals who are naturally more avoidant of negative situations. For participants who scored higher on a measure of the Behavioral Inhibition System, which reflects a tendency to avoid aversive stimuli, a notable pattern emerged. In the control condition, these individuals found it difficult to follow the “enhance” instruction—they struggled to voluntarily increase their negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the slow-paced breathing exercise, this was no longer the case; they became just as capable of enhancing their emotional experience as other participants. This finding hints that the calming effect of the breathing may provide a sense of safety that allows individuals to approach and engage with uncomfortable emotions in a more controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study acknowledge some limitations. As a pilot study, the sample size of 13 participants was small, and the findings will need to be replicated with larger, more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primary limitation was a potential “floor effect.” The breathing exercise was so effective at lowering negative feelings and arousal at baseline that it left little room for further reduction. In the breathing condition, the emotional ratings for the “maintain” instruction were already almost as low as the ratings for the “suppress” instruction in the control condition. This makes it difficult to determine how much additional benefit the cognitive reappraisal strategy provided on top of the breathing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address this by using more intensely negative stimuli. Future studies should also incorporate direct physiological measurements, such as heart rate variability, to confirm that the observed emotional benefits are indeed linked to increased activity in the body’s calming parasympathetic nervous system.

Uber Eats was the cornerstone of his diet. Exercise or even spending any time outside was practically non-existent. And his habits only got worse during COVID.

He’d often ask his friends if they wanted to play basketball, tennis or something else together. “Through tennis, I discovered &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pickleball-best-sport-to-live-longer-rcna186956" target="_blank"&gt;pickleball&lt;/a&gt;. That was the hook for me in terms of living a healthier and active lifestyle. I’ve become a&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/pickleball-why-sport-good-your-health-t237464" target="_blank"&gt; pickleball fanatic&lt;/a&gt;,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8eabe" class="body-graf"&gt;In December 2023, he joined &lt;a href="https://www.lifetime.life/"&gt;Life Time&lt;/a&gt;. “One thing I appreciate there is the community. I get to play pickleball, my favorite sport. Some people say going to the gym is a chore, but I’m excited to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-867a5b" class="body-graf"&gt;"There are endorphins you get from exercising, from being around others and from having that community," he says. "In the past, going to the gym was a solo grind, and I had to force myself to go. Now, it’s not a chore. It’s part of my lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd7f3b" class="body-graf"&gt;Having friends at the gym and at pickleball builds accountability for him, too. “My friends will say, ‘Ethan, I’ll see you tomorrow.’ And, of course, then I go after work. They’re expecting me,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-746b57" class="body-graf"&gt;He has also joined some running clubs, such as Pitch &amp;amp; Run, and now he’s working toward an ambitious goal — &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/sheinelle-jones-reflects-new-york-city-marathon-time-rcna123749" target="_blank"&gt;running the New York City marathon&lt;/a&gt; in November. He earned the opportunity to participate through his alma mater, Chaminade High School in Long Island. “I’m nervous for the marathon because I know it’s a daunting mental task. I’m focusing on the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/best-treadmill-workout-20-minute-interval-training-today-t233997" target="_blank"&gt;interval training&lt;/a&gt; and the strength training,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-14f8fd"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/ethan-noblesala-weight-loss-mc-250703-03-6eced5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/ethan-noblesala-weight-loss-mc-250703-03-6eced5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/ethan-noblesala-weight-loss-mc-250703-03-6eced5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/ethan-noblesala-weight-loss-mc-250703-03-6eced5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/ethan-noblesala-weight-loss-mc-250703-03-6eced5.jpg" alt="Ethan Noblesala"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Noblesala made fitness fun by finding a community in Pickleball and running clubs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Ethan Noblesala&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-206ea1" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He prioritizes sleep, rest and recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a69a6" class="body-graf"&gt;Noblesala recognizes now how his lack of sleep was making his health worse: “Your body needs to recover. I’m averaging six and a half to seven and a half hours of sleep a night now, and I definitely feel it when I don’t get &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/sleep/is-7-hours-of-sleep-enough-rcna117214" target="_blank"&gt;seven hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57d085" class="body-graf"&gt;He’s also careful about balancing his workouts with rest. He finds fitness data so valuable that he wears an Apple watch, a Whoop tracker and an &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/shop/oura-ring-vs-apple-watch-rcna200247" target="_blank"&gt;Oura ring&lt;/a&gt;. After a day where he ran seven miles and played two hours of pickleball, he saw that his Whoop told him to take it lighter the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8eeae2" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can make these informed decisions with technology. It was harder to do this 10 years ago,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-605821" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His new lifestyle inspires a career venture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d0057" class="body-graf"&gt;Now that Noblesala is 85 pounds lighter and his life is centered around healthy living, he has no intention of returning to his old habits.

    &lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have believed that inflammation inevitably increases with age, quietly fuelling diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24833586/"&gt;heart disease, dementia and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00888-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of Indigenous populations challenges that idea and could reshape how we think about ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have identified chronic low-level inflammation – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10911963/"&gt;“inflammaging”&lt;/a&gt; – as one of the primary drivers of age-related diseases. Think of it as your body’s immune system stuck in overdrive – constantly fighting battles that don’t exist, gradually wearing down organs and systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inflammaging might not be a universal feature of ageing after all. Instead, it could be a byproduct of how we live in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;, compared patterns of inflammation in four very different communities around the world. Two groups were from modern, industrialised societies – older adults living in Italy and Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two were Indigenous communities who live more traditional lifestyles: the Tsimane people of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli in the forests of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from more than 2,800 people, looking at a wide range of inflammatory molecules, known as cytokines. Their goal was to find out whether a pattern seen in earlier studies – where certain signs of inflammation rise with age and are linked to disease – also appears in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, it turns out, is both yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Italian and Singaporean participants, the researchers found a fairly &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-99375-1"&gt;consistent inflammaging pattern&lt;/a&gt;. As people aged, levels of inflammatory markers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor, rose together. Higher levels were linked to a greater risk of chronic diseases including kidney disease and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the Tsimane and Orang Asli populations, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33100820/"&gt;inflammaging pattern was absent&lt;/a&gt;. The same inflammatory molecules did not rise consistently with age, and they were not strongly linked to age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, among the Tsimane, who face high rates of infections from parasites and other pathogens, inflammation levels were often elevated. Yet this &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/abstract"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt; lead to the same rates of chronic diseases that are common in industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite high inflammatory markers, the Tsimane experience very low rates of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflammaging may not be universal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results raise important questions. One possibility is that inflammaging, at least as measured through these blood signals, is not a universal biological feature of ageing. Instead, it may arise in societies marked by high-calorie diets, low physical activity and reduced exposure to infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, chronic inflammation linked to ageing and disease might not simply result from an inevitable biological process, but rather from a mismatch between our ancient physiology and the modern environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that in communities with more traditional lifestyles – where people are more active, eat differently and are exposed to more infections – the immune system may work in a different way. In these groups, higher levels of inflammation might be a normal, healthy response to their environment, rather than a sign that the body is breaking down with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that inflammaging may still occur in all humans, but it might appear in different ways that are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35246947/"&gt;not captured by measuring inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; in the blood. It could be happening at a cellular or tissue level, where it remains invisible to the blood tests used in this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Chronic low-level inflammation may be a lifestyle problem.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/asian-fat-man-enjoy-eat-unhealthy-2213279091"&gt;Nattakorn_Maneerat/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed, they could have significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they challenge how we diagnose and treat chronic inflammation in ageing. Biomarkers used to define inflammaging in European or Asian populations might not apply in other settings, or even among all groups within industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they suggest that lifestyle interventions aimed at lowering chronic inflammation, such as exercise, changes in diet, or drugs targeting specific inflammatory molecules, might have different effects in different populations. What works for people living in cities might be unnecessary, or even ineffective, in those living traditional lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this research serves as an important reminder that much of our knowledge about human health and ageing comes from studies conducted in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429567/"&gt;wealthy, industrialised nations&lt;/a&gt;. Findings from these groups cannot automatically be assumed to apply worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are clear: this study is just the beginning. They urge scientists to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00082-y"&gt;dig deeper&lt;/a&gt;, using new tools that can detect inflammation not just in the blood, but within tissues and cells where the real story of ageing may be unfolding. Just as important, they call for more inclusive research that spans the full range of human experience, not just the wealthy, urbanised corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this study offers an important lesson. What we thought was a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317232120"&gt;universal truth about the biology of ageing&lt;/a&gt; might instead be a local story, shaped by our environment, lifestyle and the way we live.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

I’m with them until the end — but I want answers.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Finally, after ruling out every infection and illness they could think of, the vets landed on a likely cause: cerebellar hypoplasia — a brain condition caused by exposure to feline panleukopenia virus in the womb that affects balance and coordination. It’s not curable, but it’s also not painful, and it’s not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="9"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;So, Lyle made a decision: “I said, ‘I take this burden on.

After he left, I was kind of stumped, as his dick seemed much smaller than it had when we were dating. He had lost about 30 pounds and everything I could find said most penises seem larger because of the loss of fat at the base of the pubis, not the opposite. And it didn’t just seem shorter, but less thick. Does aging do anything to shrink it, or was it just a psychological trick, me remembering it as bigger? Since we never did anything more, I could never judge if it might have felt the same, and the opportunity has never arisen to try to get together again. Since then, he met someone else, so I probably won’t have the opportunity to ever find out either. Do you know if this is possible, or am I cray-cray?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="184" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzospc001n3b6hfnyt0cze@published"&gt;Shrinkage is, indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/penis-shrinkage"&gt;a thing&lt;/a&gt;—and it can be way longer lasting than the situational kind described on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG2dF5PS0bI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Usually the change isn’t too drastic, but it may be observable to the eagle-eyed connoisseur. There are a few known causes for this, which include Peyronie’s disease, weight gain, and prostate surgery. Another culprit: erectile dysfunction. In these cases, “the thought is that the shrinkage occurs due to the loss of spontaneous and nocturnal erections,” explained Dr. Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College. “This more frequent nourishing blood keeps the penis healthy. The every-so-often erections guys get for intercourse (on average most people have sex once a week) wouldn’t be enough to support good penile health and would lead to the shrinkage. The length maintenance is more about the erections and semi-elections (chubs if you will) that happen when not having sex.” Welliver actually discussed this topic in more detail, including ways of treating such shrinkage, on an upcoming episode of the How to Do It podcast on the specific topic of &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/how-to-do-it"&gt;“COVID dick.”&lt;/a&gt; So be on the lookout for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s also possible that you’re misremembering. I’ve done that—every once in a while I’ll catch a FWB on the long lap and I’ll be slapped in the face with the realization that my memory was extremely generous with the inches. Again, it could be that your ex experienced one of the aforementioned conditions in the intervening time, but it could also be the rose-colored funhouse mirror of nostalgia coming from inside of you.&lt;/p&gt;

Once I had tested positive I got him to test and it was found in his throat. He told me he had suffered on and off with sore throats for some time. We have had plenty of oral sex previously and I’ve always been ok. Is it possible he cheated or could this have been lying dormant for well over a year?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00233b6hoglv538d@published"&gt;Once again I am roped into a game that I would generally not elect to play, but am compelled to as a result of this job: Spot the Cheater. I wouldn’t be comfortable even taking a stab here without some hard data, so I come bearing it: Researchers in a 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366826/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Clinical Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt; journal found by analyzing 21 pharyngeal gonorrhea infections, that the estimated median duration of untreated infections was 16.3 weeks. Quite short of the “well over a year” that you’re inquiring about. Many infections cleared spontaneously in much shorter time periods, or so suggest the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00243b6hhfaj9lap@published"&gt;Keep in mind that data on this are scant, primarily because of the ethical barriers in monitoring untreated infections. This study overcame those hurdles by having the men who participated (who all had sex with men) swab themselves on a weekly basis, and then those results were frozen and not tested until the participants had completed the 48-week study. They were told to be screened for STDs as usual, and many were treated with antibiotics over the course of the experiment, as the study notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00253b6hqtduj9wn@published"&gt;For another layer of certainty—the condom unrolled over our proverbial PrEP bottle if you will—I consulted with some experts. Dr. Lindley Barbee, the lead author on that study, as well as a professor at the University of Washington and the medical director of public health at the Seattle and King County Sexual Health Clinic, pointed out in an email that, “pharyngeal GC usually doesn’t produce many symptoms, so if you equate dormancy with symptom status, it is pretty much a ‘dormant infection’ by definition. Definitely will only be found if tested.” Barbee also emphasized that her study should be taken for what it is—a series of observations. “There could certainly be longer infections, but that has not been observed,” she wrote. Finally, Barbee reminds us to keep in mind that gonorrhea &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/629209"&gt;may be spread via kissing&lt;/a&gt;. If extracurricular make-out sessions are allowed in your arrangement, that could potentially be one pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

Hunter Handsfield&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus, University of Washington, and a nationally recognized STD expert. “Two years is an awfully long time,” he told me by phone. “I would be skeptical if someone said they had pharyngeal gonorrhea for two years, and only now transmitted it to his or her partner.” OK, to cover our bases, let’s be conservative, I said. How about one year? “One year is also unlikely,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00273b6hkoq6mtlh@published"&gt;Handsfield also pointed out that the majority of pharyngeal cases of gonorrhea present no symptoms. “Most people have no clue anything is wrong. My guess is this has nothing to do with [the partner’s] sore throats,” said Handsfield. (Though, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sexually-transmitted-diseases/oral-gonorrhea"&gt;sore throats can certainly be symptoms &lt;/a&gt;of oral gonorrhea.)&lt;/p&gt;

We have always had a good sex life and companionship. We went through a bit of a hard time when we had stage three cancer, but we got through and now he always says if we can get through that we can get through anything. We have always had kids in our lives, as I brought a child from a previous relationship with me and had one of our own shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

Needless to say, I was stunned and hurt. My husband says it was just “chatting” and nothing happened nor did he want anything to happen. I was just recently diagnosed with endometriosis and the timing of this couldn’t be worse. I felt like I wasn’t good enough, pretty enough, that my disease (despite the fact I stood by him when he had his) was getting in the way. He said that wasn’t the case, and it was just a “mistake” and since it upset me so much he would stop and not do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzrb01002q3b6h2xqnjawv@published"&gt;But since that happened, I feel a “disconnect” with him. I still enjoy being with him, but can’t look or feel the same way about him. I know he didn’t physically cheat on me, but it still feels like a betrayal. He’s hot and cold—I never know what he’s thinking now. It just seems like we can’t get on the same page since this happened. What do I do? I really don’t want a divorce or open marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="231" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzrb01002t3b6hx2wqjjxn@published"&gt;He &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; betray you, and I hope that he adequately apologized—his vowing to stop the behavior is a good sign, but your letter describes him as downplaying his transgression. Hopefully, he acknowledges the pain he’s caused you. But even then, you still won’t be out of the woods. Time is often necessary to rebuild trust—it is one thing for a (roughly) unfaithful partner to apologize, it is another thing to atone. That means living the apology. I suspect this is too new for the trust to have been rebuilt (and certainly his hot and cold attitude is no help in that matter). If you want to see this through, trusting him may look like a suspension of disbelief for a while. You have to go out on a limb and actively engage in the process of trusting him as you once did—provided that he warrants such mental heavy lifting. Reminding yourself of the fact that you trust him and why you’re with him at all may be useful. The disconnect is not great. I suspect he’s dealing with a good amount of shame and perhaps cannot quite embrace the full extent of his offense. He should, though, and you might want to look into counseling. An impartial third party could help you both see the other person’s perspective and get you that much closer to being on the same page again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don't need to worry too much about harming your bladder if you do have to hold your pee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "You can never hold it until something bad happens. Your bladder is not going to spontaneously burst. There are very few documented spontaneous bladder ruptures in the world's literature due to holding your urine too long,” Savino said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Holding your pee may feel uncomfortable, and eventually, you will empty your bladder on yourself.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you hold your urine often, you may worry about an increased risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A small 2022 study with women staying in hostels found that about a quarter of the participants reported that holding their urine for long periods contributed to the development of UTIs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it is possible that bacteria in your urine could contribute to a UTI, there is not enough evidence to say that, for most people, holding your urine too long will damage the bladder or lead to an infection, according to Benoit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we get older, our bladders can become weaker and may hold less urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While rare, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/uncontrolled-diabetes-symptoms-5120437" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;uncontrolled diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/bladder-tumors-2328869" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bladder cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and tumors can contribute to increased urination frequency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If someone has a dramatic change in the space of days, weeks, or even a month or two, I think it's a good idea to seek some medical help to make sure there is nothing more serious going on," Benoit said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who have lost control of their bladders can work to retrain this organ with the help of a healthcare provider.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If your healthcare provider rules out anything serious, there are other things to try on your own, like cutting back on caffeine and alcohol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Caffeine is a diuretic. Caffeine stimulates the bladder and makes the problem worse. So all patients with this problem benefit by decreasing caffeine," Benoit said.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that processed meat isn't particularly good for us, having already been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-long-study-links-red-meat-to-up-to-13-higher-dementia-risk"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-30-less-of-one-type-of-meat-could-prevent-future-type-2-diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/so-processed-meat-has-been-classified-as-carcinogenic-here-s-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but how much of it counts as a 'safe' level of consumption? According to new research, there's no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US researchers reviewed over 70 previous studies (involving several million participants in total), analyzing the relationships between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-processed_food"&gt;ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; and three health issues: type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166724" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, ischemic heart disease, and colorectal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="166724" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations for processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat"&gt;trans fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; were looked into, and it was the processed meat that came out with the worst results – even if the amount eaten is only small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The monotonic increases in health risk with increased consumption of processed meat suggest that there is not a 'safe' amount of processed meat consumption with respect to diabetes or colorectal cancer risk," the team from the University of Washington in Seattle &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03775-8"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to put the research into context. The associations found are relatively weak, they don't prove direct cause and effect, and the analyzed studies relied on self-reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;dietary habits&lt;/a&gt; (which may not be completely accurate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study has several strengths too – it uses a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01973-2"&gt;Burden of Proof&lt;/a&gt; method, which is more conservative when assessing impacts on health. The results tend to be minimum values, which means they likely underestimate the true health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166727" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166727" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/DiabetesChart.jpg" alt="Diabetes chart" class="wp-image-166727 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/DiabetesChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/DiabetesChart-600x278.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166727" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted processed meat consumption against health conditions, including type 2 diabetes.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. and has multiple causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing sunscreen and avoiding excess sun exposure are the best protection. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows antioxidants may also help guard against this common cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spending time outside can boost your mood, promote better sleep and support your immune system (plus, it’s free!). The only drawback is that outdoor time also exposes you to the sun’s skin-damaging UV rays. Over time, that could set the stage for skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By far, the top risk factor for developing skin cancer is unprotected UV exposure, followed by genetic predisposition,” says dermatologist &lt;a href="https://facetdermatology.com/en-us/pages/our-team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Geeta Yadav, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is good news, though. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  many cases of skin cancer are largely preventable. Adopting safe sun habits like applying a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913195/best-reef-safe-sunscreens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broad-spectrum sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a hat, sunglasses and clothes that cover your arms and legs, and staying in the shade can all lower your UV exposure and significantly reduce your risk. So can avoiding tanning beds, which also emit large amounts of UV light.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also bolster your skin’s defenses from the inside out by eating more antioxidants. While diet plays a smaller role in skin cancer prevention, research reveals that antioxidants can provide additional protection to safeguard your skin from this all-too-common cancer.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skin cancer occurs when abnormal skin cells develop in the skin’s outermost layer, called the epidermis. What causes those abnormal cells to develop and grow? The most common cause is DNA damage from exposure to UV rays, either from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, there are other risk factors too, like getting older or having a family history of skin cancer. You may also be more likely to develop skin cancer if you have blue or green eyes, red or blond hair, or have skin that’s fair or burns or freckles easily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, most of these risk factors are beyond your control. But there is one helpful step you can take, and that’s eating an antioxidant-rich diet. In fact, research has found that dietary &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; can help counteract some of the damage caused by UV exposure before it turns into cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And the list is long: selenium, zinc, copper, carotenoids, polyphenols and vitamins A, C and E may all be protective, according to research. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Combat Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exposure to UV light sets off a chain reaction that creates a storm of skin-damaging compounds called free radicals. That’s where antioxidants step in. “Antioxidants combat free radicals, unstable molecules that can damage cells and their DNA, proteins and lipids,” says Yadav. “When there are too many free radicals in the body to the point that antioxidants cannot help neutralize them, oxidative stress occurs, leading to cellular dysfunction. This dysfunction could manifest as early signs of aging, but it could also manifest as cancer.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regularly consuming antioxidant-rich foods equips your body with the defenders needed to neutralize those free radicals before they cause long-term harm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Prevent the Spread of Cancerous Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all DNA damage leads to cancer. In fact, our bodies have a natural defense mechanism to kill off DNA-damaged cells before they turn cancerous and start to spread.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not foolproof, and some damage can fall through the cracks. Fortunately, research reveals that antioxidants called anthocyanins may help speed the process. While anthocyanins are found in lots of fruits and vegetables, one of the best sources for skin protection is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/22787/ingredients/fruit/berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;. So, load up on these juicy fruits for an extra dose of prevention.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunburns aren’t just painful. This inflammatory reaction in your skin can cause long-lasting damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053196/foods-skin-protection-sun-damage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that they help absorb some of the sun’s harmful UV rays and reduce inflammation to decrease the development of sunburn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one study found that carotenoids, antioxidants found in yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables, could provide the equivalent sun protection to SPF 4 sunscreen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For the biggest bang, think tomatoes. They’re filled with a carotenoid called lycopene that’s been shown to guard against sun damage from the inside out.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the Rainbow:&lt;/strong&gt; An easy rule of thumb for adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; to your diet is to add more color to your plate. Fruits and vegetables with bright, deep hues are often the richest source of these beneficial compounds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brew a Cup of Green Tea&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a reason green tea is added to face creams, masks and serums. It’s rich in antioxidants called catechins that have been shown to calm UV-related skin inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savor Some Dark Chocolate: &lt;/strong&gt;While chocolate may not prevent skin cancer, it contains inflammation-taming antioxidants called polyphenols that may improve skin hydration and circulation. Since dark chocolate contains the most polyphenols, the darker the chocolate, the better!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting regular skin checks and practicing safe sun habits like applying sunscreen, wearing a hat and protective clothing, and staying in the shade may all help reduce your risk of skin cancer. While diet plays a much smaller role, research has found that antioxidants may offer additional protection. Antioxidants are believed to combat cancer-causing oxidative stress, slow the spread of cancer cells and boost your body’s internal defenses against inflammation and sunburn. And the best way to get more of them isn’t a pill or powder. It’s a diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables. So, before you hit the beach, park or pool, head to the produce aisle!&lt;br&gt;

But, he said, there have been more sore throat and non-pneumonia symptoms since the omicron variant, so about 70 percent of people with covid, even before the new variants, had a sore throat, and some of them included people with severe sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VBEBQZQLCJGMDOEHZZAN7GR6HU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Blumberg said that he isn’t aware of any actual scientific data that supports this symptom. “I think that might have been subjective reports,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5I2IJ2VA2VHIPE623DGWJKJ5WI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Symptoms common to all variants include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, fatigue and congestion, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PORUOMWOT5FG3MQYPWFPPEQ5QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Each variant has different symptoms for different people, said &lt;a href="https://asm.org/biographies/daniel-griffin" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, clinical instructor of medicine and infectious-disease specialist at Columbia University. “Some people have a horrible sore throat, and it’s not covid.

One drug often used in treatment is Paxlovid, which should be taken within the first five days. Another drug is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/21/remdesivir-covid-outpatient-drug/" target="_blank"&gt;remdesivir&lt;/a&gt;, which is recommended if you are taking medications that have  interactions with Paxlovid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TO3JSC5X4NECLOAMEZT6SBWKVM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re throat is really sore, use a liquid formulation of Tylenol, like what kids use, but at a higher adult dose, Chin-Hong said.

They also reveal how well your brain may fare in the years ahead, including whether or not you might develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long‑running study of 8,623 adults has found that a subtle slowdown in detecting a faint triangle on a computer screen can hint at Alzheimer’s disease up to 12  years before diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/schools/sport-exercise-health-sciences/people/eef-hogervorst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eef Hogervorst&lt;/a&gt; of Loughborough University says the simple test “could slot into routine checkups without adding a single drop of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vision-timing-signals-brain-trouble"&gt;Vision timing signals brain trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants pressed a button when they spotted a triangle drifting amid random dots. Those who later developed dementia needed roughly two extra seconds – a gap large enough to raise their future risk by 56 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task measures &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3615057/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visual processing speed&lt;/a&gt;, the time the brain takes to register and respond to a stimulus. Sluggish scores predicted dementia even after researchers adjusted for age, education, and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Visual sensitivity is related to memory performance,” noted Hogervorst. She adds that eyesight often declines quietly, leaving people unaware until memory falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern appeared in an independent analysis showing that early amyloid plaques disrupt visual signals before &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-isnt-only-stored-in-our-brains-other-cells-can-remember-too/"&gt;memory centers&lt;/a&gt; suffer. Taken together, the findings suggest eye‑based tests could extend the warning window for preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-offer-dementia-warning"&gt;Eyes offer dementia warning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retina is an outgrowth of the brain, so toxic proteins can accumulate there first. Researchers now examine retinal layers for thinning, abnormal blood vessels, and microscopic deposits that mirror cerebral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage often begins in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-brain-region-that-connects-all-the-senses/"&gt;occipital cortex&lt;/a&gt;, the region that deciphers vision, before spreading to the hippocampus. That makes contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, and motion detection early casualties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer’s also struggle to ignore distractions. “These problems could increase the risk of driving accidents,” warned &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/schools/sport-exercise-health-sciences/people/thom-wilcockson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thom Wilcockson&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist at &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Loughborough University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye-tracking research confirms the concern, showing that older drivers with dementia exhibit erratic saccades, longer fixations, and reduced scanning range – all linked to crash risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-slowing-detection-really-means"&gt;What slowing detection really means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting a shape on a screen sounds trivial, yet it taps fast neural circuits shared with memory. When those circuits lag, forgetting names and appointments may follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Norfolk data showed the triangle test remained significant after standard memory exams were considered. In clinics, combining both could improve accuracy while saving time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slower vision also correlates with trouble recognizing faces, a social cue often missed in early &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Patients skim past eyes and mouths, failing to “imprint” new acquaintances and later feeling lost in familiar rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several groups are testing whether directed eye exercises can sharpen recall. Early trials of rapid left‑right movements report modest gains, though results remain mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smartphones-join-dementia-fight"&gt;Smartphones join dementia fight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High‑grade eye trackers once cost thousands of dollars. A California &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491102.3502493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; has squeezed similar optics into a smartphone app that uses the front‑facing infrared camera to measure pupil changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prototype walks users through a brief &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-pupil-dilation-to-brains-working-memory-levels/"&gt;pupil&lt;/a&gt; dilation task, then uploads data for cloud analysis. Engineers hope the approach will let families monitor brain health between clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer wearables are also inching closer. Some virtual‑reality headsets already track gaze direction at millisecond resolution, offering another route for large‑scale screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, technology alone is not enough. Experts stress the need for clear guidelines to avoid false alarms and protect privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fight-dementia-with-eye-health"&gt;Fight dementia with eye health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle counts, too. A 14‑year &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of almost 2,000 older adults found those who read at least once a week cut cognitive decline odds by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading, watching subtitles, or knitting forces the eyes to dart and refocus, a workout for neural networks. Longer education and regular exercise add extra cognitive reserve, buffering the toll of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optometrists recommend annual exams after people reach 60 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporting new glare, color shifts, or slowed adaptation can nudge physicians to order broader &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive checks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vision‑friendly habits help, too.

Think again. Before you break a sweat, it helps to know the difference between just moving your body and actually boosting your health. Physical activity is any movement, from chasing after your pet to dancing in your room. Exercise is more focused and intentional, like a brisk walk or a yoga session. And fitness? That’s your body’s overall ability to keep up and stay strong. It’s not just about muscles—your heart, lungs, brain, and even hormones play a role. The best part? You don’t need fancy equipment and extra expenses to stay youthful—just the right kind of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Squats: An anti-ageing exercise you can do anywhere&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying strong and mobile in your later years doesn’t require a fancy gym membership or high-intensity cardio. According to geriatric researchers and public health experts, a simple movement—the squat—may be one of the most effective, no-cost ways to maintain strength, flexibility, and independence with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research supports this idea. A study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research (2022) analysed squatting patterns in adults aged 70–85 and found that both traditional squats and chair squats significantly activate key muscle groups involved in everyday movements, like walking, rising from a chair, or climbing stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr. Joel Press, a specialist in physical medicine, noted: “These simple squatting motions target the glutes, quadriceps, and core—muscles critical for balance and injury prevention in older populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ageing muscles need more than just walking&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, sarcopenia—the gradual loss of muscle mass and strength—becomes more prominent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults over 65 should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity weekly, including muscle-strengthening exercises twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not just about walking. Research published in Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise (2018) found that older adults who engaged in regular lower-body resistance training, including squats, experienced improved functional mobility, faster walking speed, and fewer falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. David Behm, a co-author of the study, explained: “Squats offer functional benefits because they mimic real-life movements. They train the body in a way that supports daily independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From research to routine: How to squat safely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, try bodyweight chair squats:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in front of a chair with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower your hips back as if sitting, then gently touch the chair without fully sitting down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push through your heels to stand again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Repeat 8–10 times for 2–3 sets, gradually increasing as strength builds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The squat trick you should know to stay mobile without a gym&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the gym feels out of reach or intimidating, you can just go for simple squats—especially chair squats, which can be an easy and effective way to stay strong and independent as you age. New research looked into how two common squat variations affect older adults' muscles and joints, and the findings are both reassuring and useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied healthy seniors aged 70 to 85 doing two types of squats: a regular bodyweight squat and a chair squat (where you squat onto a standard chair and rise again). Using motion sensors and muscle tracking, they measured joint movement, muscle effort, and power during both exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chair squats (CSQ) are great for building hip strength—ideal for improving stability and preventing falls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular squats (SQ) work more on the knees and ankles, helping with mobility for daily tasks like climbing stairs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though both types of squats use the same major muscle groups, they engage them in slightly different ways—so alternating between them can give a full-body lower-body workout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both can be done at home, with no equipment, making them safe, practical, and accessible—even if you're not a gym-goer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening your lower body helps preserve your ability to walk, climb stairs, and get up from chairs—all essential for staying independent. Plus, chair squats mimic real-life movements, making them especially helpful for everyday function and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/just-a-daily-walk-can-help-prevent-dementia-and-heart-disease/articleshow/122228263.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Just a daily walk can help prevent dementia and heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 12:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>超级健康的妈妈， 39岁，死于肠癌，分享了她希望自己没有忽视的常见症状-每日邮报 | Super-fit mum, 39, dying from bowel cancer shares the common symptom she wishes she hadn't ignored - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Krystal Maeyke began experiencing sharp stabbing pains in her stomach, she shrugged them off as a food allergy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For three months she tried to ignore the increasingly uncomfortable sensations in her lower abdomen, gritting her teeth as they grew in intensity from a light pinch to so severe she was brought to her knees in agony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-one, then aged just 37, was blissfully unaware that she was living with late stage bowel &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-26227ab0-58c9-11f0-aef4-cdca7b679296"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and the pains which were plaguing her life was her body struggling to function under a growing network of deadly tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'At first I thought I would get checked for food intolerances. As I was fit and healthy, exercising daily and eating a wholesome balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tests came back negative to gluten intolerance. But the pain continued. Some days I would be in agony and have to keep a heat pack on it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But eventually she reached her ultimate pain threshold, and on May 30 2023 she was airlifted from her remote home in the Australian desert town of Yulara, in the Northern Territory, to the nearest hospital 280miles (450km) away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mid-air, she was given morphine—'which did nothing'—before nurses administered potent painkiller Fentanyl which 'began to calm the severe pain'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At Alice Springs Hospital she was given a series of tests before being given the devastating news that she had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Krystal Maeyke found out she had stage 4 cancer at the age of just 37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The mum-of-one just put down her stomach pains to a food allergy, but it was a tumour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I underwent a series of tests. That’s when I knew it was something serious. I was woken up later that night by a doctor whose words I will never forget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'"Krystal, I've got bad news…. You have cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The weight of those words, accompanied by my question of "How do you know?" and the doctor's response, "It's everywhere," shook me to my core.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Maeyke was told that she has stage four terminal metastatic bowel cancer, which means that the initial cancer from her bowel had spread to other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she's convinced that the shooting pains she felt was the cancer taking over her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I thought it wasn’t anything sinister. That’s is why it became advanced cancer and spread all through my abdomen, liver, ovaries and starting from my bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt each stabbing pain, when it was spreading in my bowel with a tumour almost blocking my bowels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt the lump appear and was told it may just be a lymph node.

I begun having sharp stabbing pains in my stomach about 3 months before I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Terminal Metastatic Bowe Cancer at 37 years old. The stabbing pains started off lightly and by the end of it, it was enough pain to drop me on my knees. At first I thought I would get checked for food intolerances. As I was fit and healthy, exercising daily and eating a wholesome balanced diet. Tests came back negative to gluten intolerance. But the pain continued. Some days I would be in agony and have to keep a heat pack on it. Until one day, I couldn’t bare the stabbing pains and I was airlifted out to the nearest hospital which was 45kms away. I was living remote in the desert of Australia where there was no hospital. That is why I didn’t go sooner. As soon as I was in the air I was given morphine which did nothing. Then the nurse gave me Fentanyl, 100 times stronger than morphine and it began to calm the severe pain. If you have any of these symptoms please, Please go to your Doctor immediately. I didn’t go straight away from living remote and I thought it wasn’t anything sinister. That’s is why it became advanced Cancer and spread all through my abdomen, liver, ovaries and starting from my bowel. I felt each stabbing pain, when it was spreading in my bowel with a tumour almost blocking my bowels. I felt the lump appear and was told it may just be a lymph node. That was the tumour I was feeling. And as it spread during that time, I felt it reach my ovaries as the stabbing pains continued. Never in a million years would I think that I would have this cruel disease in my body trying to kill me. Cancer hurts 😓 I pray to God every day to take away the pain and heal me from this disease 🙏 &lt;a title="cancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancer?refer=embed"&gt;#cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="bowelcancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bowelcancer?refer=embed"&gt;#bowelcancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="terminalcancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/terminalcancer?refer=embed"&gt;#terminalcancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="stage4cancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stage4cancer?refer=embed"&gt;#stage4cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancersucks" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancersucks?refer=embed"&gt;#cancersucks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerfighter" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerfighter?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerfighter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerawarness" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerawarness?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerawarness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerjourney" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerjourney?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerjourney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="metastatic" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/metastatic?refer=embed"&gt;#metastatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="metastaticcancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/metastaticcancer?refer=embed"&gt;#metastaticcancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerwarrior" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerwarrior?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerwarrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="terminalcancerjourney" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/terminalcancerjourney?refer=embed"&gt;#terminalcancerjourney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="awareness" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/awareness?refer=embed"&gt;#awareness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ son original - 🌅🤍🫶🏻" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-7251567955299977990?refer=embed"&gt;♬ son original - 🌅🤍🫶🏻&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And as it spread during that time, I felt it reach my ovaries as the stabbing pains continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never in a million years would I think that I would have this cruel disease in my body trying to kill me.

I was having irregular bowel movements but I thought it was IBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was having night sweats but I thought it was the summer heat,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has also urged people to take night sweats seriously, and to seek medical advice if they are ongoing and extreme like hers were.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Looking back now, I was experiencing persistent night sweats a few months before I was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would wake up during the night drenched in sweat, enough so I had to change clothes and sheets.

However, researchers believe multiple factors may be involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your body’s fight against cancer is one of them.

As I was fit and healthy, exercising daily and eating a wholesome balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tests came back negative to gluten intolerance. But the pain continued. Some days I would be in agony and have to keep a heat pack on it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But eventually she reached her ultimate pain threshold, and on May 30 2023 she was airlifted from her remote home in the Australian desert town of Yulara, in the Northern Territory, to the nearest hospital 280miles (450km) away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mid-air, she was given morphine—'which did nothing'—before nurses administered potent painkiller Fentanyl which 'began to calm the severe pain'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At Alice Springs Hospital she was given a series of tests before being given the devastating news that she had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Krystal Maeyke found out she had stage 4 cancer at the age of just 37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The mum-of-one just put down her stomach pains to a food allergy, but it was a tumour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I underwent a series of tests. That’s when I knew it was something serious. I was woken up later that night by a doctor whose words I will never forget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'"Krystal, I've got bad news…. You have cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The weight of those words, accompanied by my question of "How do you know?" and the doctor's response, "It's everywhere," shook me to my core.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Maeyke was told that she has stage four terminal metastatic bowel cancer, which means that the initial cancer from her bowel had spread to other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she's convinced that the shooting pains she felt was the cancer taking over her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I thought it wasn’t anything sinister. That’s is why it became advanced cancer and spread all through my abdomen, liver, ovaries and starting from my bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt each stabbing pain, when it was spreading in my bowel with a tumour almost blocking my bowels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt the lump appear and was told it may just be a lymph node.

I begun having sharp stabbing pains in my stomach about 3 months before I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Terminal Metastatic Bowe Cancer at 37 years old. The stabbing pains started off lightly and by the end of it, it was enough pain to drop me on my knees. At first I thought I would get checked for food intolerances. As I was fit and healthy, exercising daily and eating a wholesome balanced diet. Tests came back negative to gluten intolerance. But the pain continued. Some days I would be in agony and have to keep a heat pack on it. Until one day, I couldn’t bare the stabbing pains and I was airlifted out to the nearest hospital which was 45kms away. I was living remote in the desert of Australia where there was no hospital. That is why I didn’t go sooner. As soon as I was in the air I was given morphine which did nothing. Then the nurse gave me Fentanyl, 100 times stronger than morphine and it began to calm the severe pain. If you have any of these symptoms please, Please go to your Doctor immediately. I didn’t go straight away from living remote and I thought it wasn’t anything sinister. That’s is why it became advanced Cancer and spread all through my abdomen, liver, ovaries and starting from my bowel. I felt each stabbing pain, when it was spreading in my bowel with a tumour almost blocking my bowels. I felt the lump appear and was told it may just be a lymph node. That was the tumour I was feeling. And as it spread during that time, I felt it reach my ovaries as the stabbing pains continued. Never in a million years would I think that I would have this cruel disease in my body trying to kill me. Cancer hurts 😓 I pray to God every day to take away the pain and heal me from this disease 🙏 &lt;a title="cancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancer?refer=embed"&gt;#cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="bowelcancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bowelcancer?refer=embed"&gt;#bowelcancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="terminalcancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/terminalcancer?refer=embed"&gt;#terminalcancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="stage4cancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stage4cancer?refer=embed"&gt;#stage4cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancersucks" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancersucks?refer=embed"&gt;#cancersucks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerfighter" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerfighter?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerfighter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerawarness" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerawarness?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerawarness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerjourney" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerjourney?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerjourney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="metastatic" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/metastatic?refer=embed"&gt;#metastatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="metastaticcancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/metastaticcancer?refer=embed"&gt;#metastaticcancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cancerwarrior" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancerwarrior?refer=embed"&gt;#cancerwarrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="terminalcancerjourney" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/terminalcancerjourney?refer=embed"&gt;#terminalcancerjourney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="awareness" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/awareness?refer=embed"&gt;#awareness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ son original - 🌅🤍🫶🏻" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-7251567955299977990?refer=embed"&gt;♬ son original - 🌅🤍🫶🏻&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And as it spread during that time, I felt it reach my ovaries as the stabbing pains continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never in a million years would I think that I would have this cruel disease in my body trying to kill me.

			&lt;p&gt;Medications sold under brand names like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Saxenda have become famous for their weight-loss benefits, but that only scratches the surface of what these injections are potentially capable of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally designed to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, GLP-1 agonists have also shown unforeseen benefits to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-may-guard-against-dementia-research-finds"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-study-finds-semaglutide-effectively-treats-serious-liver-disease"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-reveals-ozempic-lowers-risk-of-diabetic-kidney-disease"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; health – and now, it seems, the head, alleviating migraines in a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pilot trial of 31 patients with high BMI and frequent or chronic migraines, participants who received a daily injection of the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide experienced significantly fewer painful headaches. After 12 weeks, the number of days with a migraine each month decreased from a mean of 19.8 days to just 10.7 days – a reduction of nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-can-leave-lasting-damage-in-your-mouth?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Weight-Loss Drugs Like Ozempic Can Leave Lasting Damage in Your Mouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss, age, sex, and the use of other medications at the same time did not significantly alter the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that liraglutide may be effective in the treatment of unresponsive high-frequency or chronic migraine in patients with obesity, and that this effect is independent from weight loss," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14991"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; the authors, who hail from the University of Naples in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests… that the mechanisms driving liraglutide's effectiveness in migraine prevention may operate independently of the significant metabolic effects… "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladyspinedoc/video/7332631104538709279" data-video-id="7332631104538709279"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies with larger cohorts and a control group are needed to verify that hypothesis. But GLP-1 agonists, like liraglutide and possibly even its longer-lasting relative &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-study-finds-semaglutide-effectively-treats-serious-liver-disease"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;, may prove to be a promising route for future migraine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraines impact an estimated &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-022-00763-1"&gt;14 to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the global population, and yet the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-drug-reduces-symptoms-before-a-migraine-strikes-study-shows"&gt;few medications&lt;/a&gt; we have on hand do not work for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A substantial number of patients still face an unmet need, especially when preventive drugs prove ineffective," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14991"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; a team of scientists led by neurologist Simone Braca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the current pilot trial had migraines unresponsive to other treatments, meaning liraglutide worked where other drugs had not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 agonists slow appetite and help regulate blood sugar by mimicking a natural hormone in the body, called glucagon-like peptide-1, which is released after eating. That's why these drugs are so effective when it comes to managing type 2 diabetes and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But GLP-1 receptors exist throughout the body, in many different tissues and organs. The fact that liraglutide and similar medications have widespread effects outside of the pancreas makes logical sense. Still, scientists are trying to figure out what those effects are, and whether they help or harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166572" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-642x408.png" alt="GLP-1 Effects" class="size-medium wp-image-166572" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-642x408.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-654x415.png 654w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-768x488.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-1536x975.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-2048x1300.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cells-13-00065-g001-600x381.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166572" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The widespread effects of GLP-1 agonists.

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s another reason to stay away from whippets, just in case you needed one. Doctors this week have reported a strange case of frostbite via nitrous oxide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the University of Virginia described the chilling injury in a paper &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2502232"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The victim, a 23-year-old man, developed frostbite in his mouth and throat immediately after inhaling a nitrous oxide canister. Fortunately, the man was given supportive treatment and recovered no worse for wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas"&gt;Nitrous oxide gas&lt;/a&gt; has all sorts of legitimate applications, from acting as a medical sedative to helping create whipped cream. But it’s also used recreationally to induce euphoric, if short-lasting, effects. Recreational users typically get their nitrous oxide from whipped cream canisters, which gave rise to the drug’s common nickname of “whippets” (you might also know it as “whippits” or “laughing gas”).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Common side effects of whippets include dizziness, dissociation, and a momentary loss of motor control. But the compressed gas released from these canisters is also plenty cold, reaching temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit. And that cold is certainly enough to trigger frostbite—the damage caused by ice crystals forming in our skin and tissues—in body parts inadvertently exposed to the gas while using whippets.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man sought medical care after enduring two straight days of painful swallowing and hoarseness in his throat. A physical examination revealed swollen white blotches along the roof of his mouth, uvula, and throat, a potential sign of frostbitten tissue (a gnarly close-up of the frostbite can be seen &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMicm2502232/asset/b9247d4f-b933-4135-8ff7-ee1feb127fb8/assets/images/large/nejmicm2502232_f1.jpg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). He admitted to the doctors that his symptoms began right after he had inhaled nitrous oxide from a handheld canister.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Had he not been forthcoming with that information, that probably wouldn’t have been something that crossed my mind,” report co-author Michael Patrizio, associate director of acute care at UVA, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/chilling-risk-recreational-nitrous-oxide-use-frostbite-rcna216556"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News. “I would have thought a viral infection—mono, strep throat—or an STI in the throat.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While whippet-induced frostbite isn’t unprecedented, this case was a bit more unusual. Most injuries &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305417925002013#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20bilateral%20inner%20thigh%20injury%20pattern%20may%20require%20skin%20grafting."&gt;typically involve&lt;/a&gt; frostbite to people’s thighs or hands. In some cases, they have been so severe that they required skin grafts and surgery to treat. But thankfully, the man in this case only needed over-the-counter painkillers and steroid paste to ease his symptoms until his mouth healed on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping the painful experience taught the man an important lesson. Long-term recreational use of nitrous oxide is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/nitrous-oxide-whippits-paralysis-1849502376"&gt;known to deplete&lt;/a&gt; the body of vitamin B12, which can lead to serious complications like paralysis and permanent neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in four infants lacks enough healthy gut bacteria essential for training their immune systems, putting them at greater risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as allergies, asthma, and eczema by age 2.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Bifidobacteria are among the first group of good bacteria to colonize the human gut, and their presence has been linked to positive health outcomes for the host, including protection against metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal tract infections, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08274-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/i&gt; analyzed the gut microbiomes of 412 infants, selected to represent the diverse demographics of the U.S, and found a widespread deficit of Bifidobacteria in infants. Long-term health data from the infants suggested that a lack of detectable Bifidobacteria in infants may contribute to the development of atopy, a genetic predisposition to developing allergic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global estimates suggest that up to 40% of the population has some form of allergy to substances present in the environment—pollen, dust, mites, or animal dander. The last few decades have also witnessed a growing prevalence of allergic conditions among children, ranging from seasonal allergies with mild symptoms, such as a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/runny+nose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;runny nose&lt;/a&gt;, sneezing, and itchy eyes, to severe eczema and life-threatening food allergies that can send someone into an anaphylactic shock.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging data suggests that the rise in such NCDs actually begins during the first 1,000 days of a child's life—inside the mother's womb and through the first two years of life. Scientists believe that while environmental and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lifestyle+changes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; play a role, a key factor may be disruptions in the gut microbiome. In infants, this disruption includes the widespread loss of certain beneficial strains of Bifidobacterium that are essential for early immune development and long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;A baby's mode of delivery (C-section or vaginal birth), whether they were breastfed or formula-fed, and exposure to antibiotics can shape the diversity of their gut microbiome, a factor that has been linked to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt; later in life, including allergies, autoimmune diseases, obesity. Previous studies in the U.S. looking at gut bacteria in babies were mostly small and didn't include data representative of the diverse infant demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill in the gap, the researchers designed the My Baby Biome study, a seven-year longitudinal investigation that involved nationally representative data of both the infant gut microbiome and the compounds produced by the metabolic activities of the microbes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data analysis revealed that 25% of U.S. infants between 1 and 3 months of age were deficient in Bifidobacterium, and the deficiency was more pronounced in C-section births (35%) than in vaginal births (19%). In C-section &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infants&lt;/a&gt;, the beneficial bacteria were often replaced by potentially pathogenic bacteria that are known to use up human milk oligosaccharides, components in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+milk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast milk&lt;/a&gt; that shape the infant &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also found that microbiomes rich in Bifidobacterium had fewer antimicrobial-resistant and disease-causing genes, along with more beneficial metabolic profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlight that while the term dysbiosis or imbalance in the microbiome is still up for debate, the strong correlation between microbiome composition and infant health suggests that the absence of these key Bifidobacterium strains represents a true dysbiosis in early life.&lt;/p&gt;

And this is not just a quick rub here and there — these docs are thorough when applying that protective layer. “I make sure not to forget my ears, my hands and the tops of my feet,” said dermatologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drclairederm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Claire Wolinsky" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/drclairederm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Claire Wolinsky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dermatologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drhowardsobel" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Howard Sobel" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/drhowardsobel" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Howard Sobel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who often brings his kids to the beach, pays particular attention to the area under the eyes when applying sunscreen. “That area can burn quickly, especially in children,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They check the weather report, too. “I usually check the UV index first,” said dermatologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drmojiderm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mojgan Hosseinipour" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/drmojiderm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Mojgan Hosseinipour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “It provides a daily forecast of the expected intensity of UV radiation from the sun. I avoid the outdoors when the UV index is high to very high.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They cover up beyond just using sunscreen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sunscreen is protective, but clothing and hats provide greater protection, so I always cover myself as much as possible,” Wolinsky said. Elbuluk mentioned wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our family wears shirts, pants, hats and swimwear that feature Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), which is designed to block or absorb UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the fabric and reaching skin,” Hosseinipour said. “It’s convenient because it doesn’t require reapplication of sunscreen on covered areas, which can be challenging with younger kids.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dermatologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_ellen_marmur/?hl=en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ellen Marmur" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/dr_ellen_marmur/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ellen Marmur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;founder of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;MMSkincare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, said: “I always wear a wide-brimmed hat, polarized sunglasses, long flowy pants and a long-sleeved blouse if it’s early in the day.

With the redistribution, UV radiation penetrates the skin where sunscreen is no longer present.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making sure everyone reapplies sunscreen can be a challenge, but Elbuluk had a smart suggestion: Set a timer to remind yourself every two hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and drink: They hydrate but skip citrus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I avoid bringing lemon or lime wedges for beverages, to avoid something called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/phytophotodermatitis#:~:text=Phytophotodermatitis%2C%20a%20form%20of%20plant,acutely%20red%2C%20and%20often%20blister." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="phytophotodermatitis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/phytophotodermatitis#:~:text=Phytophotodermatitis%2C%20a%20form%20of%20plant,acutely%20red%2C%20and%20often%20blister." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;phytophotodermatitis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is a burn and/or hyperpigmentation at the areas of skin exposed to citrus juice and UV rays,” Wolinsky said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I pack high-water-content snacks like grapes, cucumbers, tomatoes and watermelon, since it’s important to stay hydrated while out in the sun,” Mathieu said. “Water is my go-to beverage of choice, but I also like to pack drinks containing electrolytes.

For Hosseinipour, it’s about two to three hours. Mathieu said, “I stay at the beach approximately three to four hours, depending on arrival time.” For Sobel, it’s no more than five hours. “There’s an umbrella up whenever possible, and we always take a shaded lunch break from noon to 2, which is when the sun is strongest,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When I get home, I like to double cleanse with micellar water and cleanser for my face to remove all the sunscreen residue,” Wolinsky said. “I shower to wash off sunscreen, sand and salt water, and then I apply moisturizer for face and body.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for a great sunscreen?

It is 100% mineral-based and infused with skin-loving ingredients that make it a great multitasker. It is one of the most comfortable mineral sunscreen formulas I’ve tried. It’s formulated with zinc oxide, DNA repair enzymes and vitamin E — so not only is it preventing sun damage, but it’s helping to nourish and repair the skin as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Isdin sunscreen is significantly lighter and easier to blend than traditional mineral SPFs, and doesn’t have that lingering zinc smell that personally drives me up the wall. It dries down to a soft matte and is a nice base for dewy makeup looks. While this sunscreen blends well, there is a very slight white cast that’s typical of a mineral sunscreen formulation. The combination of lightweight finish, formula and UV protection has made it worth the troubleshooting.

It's also what he uses on his four-year-old child on beach days, bike rides or hikes. He noted that this oil-free SPF is very popular among dermatologists and is formulated with antioxidants that can help protect the skin from environmental damage. He also noted that it contains senna alata, "a tropical leaf extract known for its ability to combat oxidative stress and support the prevention of premature skin aging." You can't go wrong with this non-comedogenic, water-resistant formula that is also well-suited for sensitive skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Dermstore"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Badreshia-Bansal echoed the saying that "the best SPF for daily use is one that you'll actually wear — lightweight, invisible and comfortable under makeup." She recommends a mineral SPF with low irritation potential, like &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=29069&amp;amp;awinaffid=837483&amp;amp;campaign=&amp;amp;clickref=6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Feltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf46%2F11370303%2F&amp;amp;platform=pl" target="_blank" data-affiliate="true" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="this cult-fave SPF" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=29069&amp;amp;awinaffid=837483&amp;amp;campaign=&amp;amp;clickref=6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Feltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf46%2F11370303%2F&amp;amp;platform=pl" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="28"&gt;this cult-fave SPF&lt;/a&gt; that is beloved by both HuffPost readers and editors alike.

It's a great option for people like me with sensitive and acne-prone skin. I turn to it anytime I'm going to be spending a lot of time in the sun or when I'm post-procedure and want to protect my skin without irritating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;TiZO2 facial sunscreen and primer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/TIZO-Non-Tinted-Facial-Mineral-Sunscreen/dp/B00YHPQLO8?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" data-affiliate="true" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="B00YHPQLO8" data-aps-asc-tag="thehuffingtop-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4,-1,-1,d,0,0,hp-fil-am=0,0:0,0,0,0" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Tizo 2 Facial Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/TIZO-Non-Tinted-Facial-Mineral-Sunscreen/dp/B00YHPQLO8?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D6855a7c4e4b06f37ceed26f4%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;Tizo 2 Facial Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40&lt;/a&gt; for individuals seeking both high-performance sun protection and anti-aging benefits," said Witkowski.

"It multitasks as sun protection, skincare and a glow-up in one," she said. The iron oxides that provide the tint can also help to protect your skin from blue light, which penetrates deeper than UVB and contributes to hyperpigmentation.
