    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkny5w0x00053b6ts0n8m0vs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Move over, protein. Fiber is on pace to be the next “it” nutrient of the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkppujvw00003b6tk38cw2wj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consumers — particularly Gen Z — are fixated on stomach health, leading to the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/26/health/fibermaxxing-tiktok-trend-fiber-benefits-wellness"&gt;“fibermaxxing” trend&lt;/a&gt; taking hold on TikTok. As people try to maximize the fiber in their meals, major food companies are capitalizing on the trend with new, fiber-focused products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmfbrfq000d3b6tv252g2ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a consumer need in terms of digestion and gut health, and that’s something we’ve seen the last few years,” said Sherry Frey, health and wellness thought leader at NIQ. The younger generation, she added, understands that digestive health is linked to better skin and improved cognitive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmqvfyi00083b6t542z6qcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dataessential, a food and beverage research firm, found that 52% of consumers were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;interested in trying “fibermaxxing” after learning about the trend and that 42% of shoppers think food labeled “high fiber” is healthier.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmfv6nm000t3b6tp41iwanb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fiber builds on previous wellness-focused consumer trends, Frey told CNN. First was hydration, as seen with the rise of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/24/food/hydration-electrolytes-drinks-popularity"&gt;products like Liquid I.V. and Electrolit&lt;/a&gt;. Then protein, a trend that shows no sign of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/food/starbucks-protein-cold-foam"&gt;slowing down&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpqx3ef0000356p72g590ce@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The natural next step is for fiber,” she said, calling the converging of trends a “perfect storm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmfgspw000h3b6t0751bojr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, fiber has been proven to trigger “a naturally occurring GLP-1 in our bodies,” she added, referencing the appetite-suppressing hormone in weight-loss drugs like Wegovy that are flooding the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpo7jhe0000356peeunolpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consumers’ desire for fiber is already evident on grocery store shelves. Whole Foods’ &lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/trends/the-next-big-things-our-top-8-food-trend-predictions-for-2026" target="_blank"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; for 2026 said there are “more fiber-forward callouts on packaging” as well as more products with added fiber.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmujwpe00033b6timifv0j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thrive Market, a membership-based online supermarket, has seen fiber-related terms surge 30% over the past year with shoppers gravitating toward snacks, bars and supplements, a spokesperson told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmfxh3b00153b6t0yr07vi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Major food companies have taken notice: PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said on its most recent earnings call in October that “fiber will be the next protein.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmg1uyg001e3b6tq1keljaj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It’s actually a deficiency in US consumers’ diets, and that will be elevated,” Laguarta told analysts. (More than 90% of woman and 97% of men don’t get their recommended daily intake of fiber, the US government &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmg0jlc001c3b6tr41r5zi6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PepsiCo is already bolstering its soda portfolio with fiber-forward products. Last summer, it launched a gut-friendly soda following its &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/business/pepsi-buys-poppi"&gt;purchase of Poppi&lt;/a&gt; with “Pepsi Prebiotic Cola,” which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/food/pepsi-prebiotic-soda-launch"&gt;includes added fiber.&lt;/a&gt; More products are on the way, including fiber-enhanced versions of its SunChips, Smartfood popcorn and Propel hydration packets.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkny5r0f00033b6tcu7t9foq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski also &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTbEkDuEkAC/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;recently predicted&lt;/a&gt; on his Instagram account that fiber “is going to be big” in 2026, perhaps signaling that the fast food chain could dip its toes into the trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmgesb0001x3b6tsr4rk4du@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Snacks, such as chips and puffed crackers, will be the battleground for fiber, Frey predicts, notably products made from legumes and beans. But taste is a factor, especially if it’s made from plant-based ingredients.&lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmgun1900233b6t2rvty5en@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consumers are willing to make a trade, but they’re not always willing to make the trade if the taste isn’t there,” Frey said. “Despite the economy, they’re willing to pay a little more for these kinds of products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmh02d100293b6tqyytqq3d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s where private labels created by major grocery stores come in. They are also getting into the wellness sector with fiber-enchanced products, but without the premium prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmhkd2z002u3b6tfrtggx4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aldi’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/food/aldi-label-changes"&gt;recently relaunched&lt;/a&gt; in-house line includes knock-offs of “better for you” sodas and meal bars. Walmart is expanding its Bettergoods lineup, which encompasses several foods that have plant-based ingredients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmh5k4a002i3b6txe3pjbdb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The recommended amount of fiber is 25 grams per day for adult woman to 35 for adult males, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/12/health/protein-fiber-explainer-wellness"&gt;according to medical experts&lt;/a&gt;, so “it’s a generally good healthy trend,” said Paul Kriegler, a registered dietician and senior director of nutritional products for Life Time Fitness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmhzzzv00323b6t4dwr2itm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the prepackaged products hitting shelves are not a panacea for this deficiency. He would rather consumers gravitate toward the produce and vegetable section at the grocer for their fiber needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkptxgje00003b6tupirhph6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US government’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/health/dietary-guidelines-rfk-maha"&gt;newly released dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; also urge people to prioritize “real food,” including “fiber-rich whole grains,” as well as curtail their intake of highly processed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkmi2hc200363b6tfrf27tss@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What I’ve taught clients for a long time is to eat a pile of vegetables the size of your head every day,” Kreigler told CNN. “The irony is most of the foods that will help ‘fibermaxxing’ don’t even have labels and you have to go get them fresh.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In a major change in vaccine policy, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667199/cdc-vaccine-schedule-children" target="_blank"&gt;recently dropped &lt;/a&gt;recommendations that all kids get six immunizations long considered routine. Instead, they're now in a category called "shared clinical decision-making."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's when the patient (or the parents if the patient's a child) has a conversation with a health care provider to decide if a treatment is appropriate, says &lt;a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/parmet/" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Parmet&lt;/a&gt;, who studies health care policy at Northeastern University in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In theory, shared clinical decision-making sounds great," she says. But the approach is usually reserved for complicated medical decisions where the answer is often muddy, not for routine vaccines that have been clearly shown to be safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Some examples include: Should someone get surgery or physical therapy for back pain? Which men need regular PSA prostate cancer testing?&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But many doctors say there's no ambiguity when it comes to these vaccines, which protect against &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-a/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;hepatitis A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rotavirus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;rotavirus&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous gastrointestinal infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These vaccines have clear evidence of benefit for all children," says &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/jake-scott" target="_blank"&gt;Jake Scott&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease researcher at Stanford University. "So moving them to shared decision-making doesn't reflect the scientific uncertainty that the category exists for. It manufactures this sort of uncertainty where no uncertainty really exists."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The problem with shared decision making in this context, is "you're suggesting that both options are equally valid," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112363409-lainie-friedman-ross" target="_blank"&gt;Lainie Friedman Ross&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and bioethicist at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. "And the fact is: Not getting vaccinated puts your own child at risk, puts you at risk and puts your community at risk. So it is not an equal decision."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/hhs-sweeping-changes-childhood-vaccine-schedule-cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;critics argue&lt;/a&gt; there's enough nuance about these immunizations to warrant moving them to the shared clinical decision-making category. And administration officials &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-acts-presidential-memorandum-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;say the change is designed to restore trust&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Ross and others argue that dropping these vaccines to a lower spot in the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-cdc-childhood-immunization-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;new CDC vaccine hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; sows dangerous confusion and doubt, especially at a time when vaccine hesitancy is already on the rise and vaccination rates are already falling.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It's a huge embarrassment for U.S. public health and a disaster for public trust, and most of all for children," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/douglas-j-opel/" target="_blank"&gt;Douglas Opel&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics at the Washington School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They also point out that doctors already routinely answer any questions parents may have, in addition to providing detailed handouts about each vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;New hurdles to vaccine access&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there are many practical implications that could become hurdles to kids getting the shots, even if their parents do want them, Scott says. That includes deleting automatic electronic medical record alerts when shots are due and canceling standing orders for nurses and pharmacists to vaccinate kids without getting a doctor involved.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Moving it from routinely recommended to shared clinical decision-making has a dramatic effect on the practical delivery of vaccination," Scott says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the administration says the decision shouldn't affect whether government programs or private insurance pay for the immunizations, some legal experts say that may not be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The administration says that there's not going to be insurance implications. But there are a number of problems there," says &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, who studies vaccine policies at UC Law San Francisco. "First of all they can change their interpretation later. Second, if a private insurer wanted to challenge this and say, 'This vaccine is no longer recommended. I don't have to cover it,' they probably have some good arguments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with insurance, parents may now get hit with co-pays for those extra conversations with swamped pediatricians, according to Dr. Molly O'Shea, a Detroit-area pediatrician who serves as a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Before, if it was a vaccination that we didn't have to have a conversation about, we could feel safe allowing families to schedule a vaccine-only appointment," O'Shea says. "Because shared-decision making is required now, that takes time and that now is going to be billed for."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;New liability concerns for drugmakers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another one big question is: Does this make vaccine makers and doctors vulnerable to getting sued? Many lawyers don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"On a legal standpoint, nothing has changed," says &lt;a href="https://www.greenlegalteam.com/david-carney/" target="_blank"&gt;David Carney&lt;/a&gt;, a Philadelphia lawyer who's the president of the &lt;a href="https://www.vipbar.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Injured Petitioners Bar Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some lawyers argue that the change does open the door to more litigation over vaccine injuries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The immunity under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the 1986 Act), which shields pharma and physicians from liability when vaccines cause serious harms and deaths, only applies to vaccines that are recommended for routine administration to children and/or pregnant women," &lt;a href="https://www.sirillp.com/aaron-siri/" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Siri&lt;/a&gt;, managing partner at Siri &amp;amp; Glimstad, wrote in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Siri is a close ally of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and has been extensively involved in litigation against federal agencies and vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some legal experts say that this uncertainty is alarming. Without liability protection, vaccines could become unavailable, says Parmet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't quite really know whether shared clinical decision-making will be considered as sufficient enough of a recommendation to provide the liability protection," Parmet says. "And if it doesn't do that, then there are real concerns about whether the manufacturers will continue to make vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A chilling effect on prescribers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if the change doesn't lead to an increase in successful lawsuits involving vaccines, just the possibility of lawsuits could be enough to intimidate doctors, some say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're worried about stepping on a landmine if one thing goes wrong," Parmet says. "One kid gets sick. The next day — even if it has nothing to do with the vaccine — are they going to be the ones held responsible? And someone's going to say, 'You had the nurse do it without talking to the doctor?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That could make doctors hesitant to recommend these immunizations, which means imposing shared clinical decision-making could leave more kids more vulnerable to dangerous infections.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I do think many physicians will be chilled in their behavior around recommending vaccination," says &lt;a href="https://law.stanford.edu/michelle-m-mello/" target="_blank"&gt;Michelle Mello&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of health policy and law at Stanford.

I didn't even have her buckled in because she couldn't lift her head," Steed, 30, tells PEOPLE. "I was afraid she'd stop breathing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"When we arrived at the emergency room, they immediately took us back. They called in a careflight for her, and she was sent to a children's [hospital] in Dallas," she continues. "When she got to Dallas, they said her blood sugar was over 600, and her A1C was 12.8%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It was in that moment that Steed learned her daughter's actual diagnosis, quickly realizing that she didn't have the flu, but was in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) — a "life-threatening complication of diabetes and undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes," &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per the Cleveland Clinic.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to the academic medical center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to the academic medical center&lt;/a&gt;, an A1C test measures "the average amount of (glucose) sugar in your blood." For people without diabetes, a normal A1C is below 5.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maygen Steed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paisley Steed in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The doctors told us that if we waited any longer to bring her in, she wouldn't be alive," Steed shares. "I still have nightmares about her diagnosis day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the family has learned how to manage Paisley's type 1 diabetes, it hasn't been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recently, Steed shared a video of her daughter in the car, asking from the backseat if she would have to deal with diabetes her whole life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"When I grow up to be a mom, will I still have to have a Dexcom and [Omni]pod?" the now-5-year-old asked in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maygen_k1995/video/7578374722887355662" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the clip,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the clip,&lt;/a&gt; which went viral, amassing over 550,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steed wrote atop the video, "I walk into a haunted house but instead of clowns &amp;amp; monsters it's just my baby asking me if she'll still be diabetic when she grows up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steed shares that "in that moment, my heart broke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"No 5-year-old should be having to think about whether or not they will continue to struggle with a chronic illness when they are a mom," she says. "As I fumbled with the words to say, I just softly said yes because I can't lie to her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This will be something that she deals with for the rest of her life. As long as I am her mom, though, I will take as much of the burden off of her as I can," Steed adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steed has been inspired to share information about Paisley's diagnosis on her TikTok account as a way to "advocate and share about type 1 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maygen Steed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paisley Steed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"While the actual diagnosis of type 1 diabetes cannot be avoided (it's an autoimmune disorder/genetic), a traumatic diagnosis can be avoided by knowing the signs and symptoms of early DKA," she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Along with type 1 diabetes, Steed notes that Paisley "also suffers from thyroid trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I struggle with caregiver fatigue and anxiety over parenting a high needs child," she adds. "Every alarm that goes off on her phone, my chest tightens with worst-case scenarios, but I am working on that and trying to be positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Her Graves' disease is in remission, but we are currently struggling with hypothyroidism and all of the side effects from that. Her little body goes through so much," she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite this, Steed tries to remain positive about Paisley's type 1 diabetes diagnosis, which she's had for a "little over three years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Each year on her 'diaversary', we have a little celebration that we hit another year of surviving with T1D.

"She is so full of personality, and sometimes I forget that she's only 5, not 15. She is witty and such a joy to be around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Although I cannot trade places with her, I can educate myself on the best way to care for her and advocate for her needs," Steed adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-shares-heartbreaking-moment-daughter-asks-about-diabetes-exclusive-11889221" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life UK</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5zRU00aHlRUkwwdHVIM0k2WmRmaFlLdEpsNGFxYTF5Y1JVYUdmaFdyZnZrc2VIVjZPY3U4MDQycDdsS2tXck5KZkJoclROa3Q0MWdoVUJZTjdUTEJ1bFJNQmdxeXJCN3B0akRPMkt1RTFFQQ</guid></item><item><title>随着危险变形虫在全球蔓延，科学家呼吁采取紧急行动- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260124003856.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Environmental and public health researchers are drawing attention to a little-known group of pathogens that may pose a rising global danger: free living amoebae. In a new perspective published in &lt;em&gt;Biocontaminant&lt;/em&gt;, the team explains that these microscopic organisms are gaining ground worldwide, driven by climate change, deteriorating water systems, and limited monitoring and detection efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amoebae are single celled organisms that naturally occur in soil and water. Most are harmless, but certain species can cause severe and sometimes fatal disease. One of the best-known examples is &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; (often referred to as the brain eating amoeba), which can cause a rare but almost always deadly brain infection. Infection can occur when contaminated water enters the nose during activities like swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why These Amoebae Are So Hard to Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes these organisms particularly dangerous is their ability to survive conditions that kill many other microbes," said corresponding author Longfei Shu of Sun Yat sen University. "They can tolerate high temperatures, strong disinfectants like chlorine, and even live inside water distribution systems that people assume are safe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that amoebae can act as protective hosts for other disease-causing microbes. Bacteria and viruses can survive inside amoebae, shielded from disinfection processes that would normally eliminate them. This so called Trojan horse effect allows harmful pathogens to persist and spread through drinking water systems and may also play a role in the rise of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising global temperatures are expected to make the problem worse by allowing heat loving amoebae to spread into regions where they were once uncommon. Several recent outbreaks linked to recreational water exposure have already increased public concern in multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Call for a One Health Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors urge a coordinated One Health strategy that brings together public health, environmental research, and water management. They emphasize the need for better surveillance, faster and more accurate diagnostic tools, and advanced water treatment technologies to reduce risks before infections occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Amoebae are not just a medical issue or an environmental issue," Shu said. "They sit at the intersection of both, and addressing them requires integrated solutions that protect public health at its source."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Left unaddressed, these cancers may infiltrate the inner layers of the eye and the brain, making them far less treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the cancer can begin in a place even without skin, such as inside the eye, in a form of the disease called ocular melanoma. Of ocular melanomas, there are several subtypes, including uveal melanoma and conjunctival melanoma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skin and eyes share the same cells called melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin, eyes and hair their color. Damage and mutations in these cells lead to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while melanoma is commonly caused by sun exposure, uveal and conjunctival melanoma are not primarily associated with harmful UV light. Instead, people with lighter eye colors or pre-existing eye conditions like near-sightedness may be at a greater risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As melanoma, and skin cancer in general, is on the rise nationwide, eye doctors have urged Americans to keep up with regular eye exams every one to two years to detect potentially cancerous changes, and to be on the lookout for seemingly subtle changes like blurred vision, spots and irritation in or around the eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is not always just on the skin (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Allison Dashow, pictured above in 2025, was diagnosed with ocular melanoma four years ago at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jacqueline Bowen, an eye doctor and president of the American Optometric Association, told the Daily Mail: 'Skin cancer involving the eye can appear in several different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some start in or around the eye itself, while others spread to the eye from elsewhere in the body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1 million US adults are currently living with melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, and about 212,000 will be diagnosed this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mortality rate from the disease in the US is about two per 100,000 people, resulting in around 8,000 deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And melanoma rates have surged over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the rate of melanoma diagnoses in the US doubled from 1982 to 2011, and there was a 31.5 percent increase between 2011 and 2019, the latest figures available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women over 50, there has been a three percent increase in melanoma rates per year, while men under 50 have seen a one percent dip yearly. Rates among women under 50 and men over 50 have remained stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Signs of skin cancer range from innocuous to obvious, but experts warn that treating cases early is key to making sure they do not spread or further develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dashow, now 29, after her surgery with a covering over the eye affected by ocular melanoma, which she wore for seven days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two forms of melanoma that grow in the eye, subtypes of ocular melanoma, are uveal and conjunctival melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are usually no symptoms in early stages of ocular melanomas, but as the diseases progress, patients may experience blurry vision, floaters or flashes in their vision and changes in pupil shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact causes are unclear, but experts believe the disease is more likely in people with lighter eyes and skin colors. The role of UV light in ocular melanomas' development is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are about 2,000 new cases of ocular melanoma every year, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conjunctival melanoma, developing in the conjunctiva (clear tissue over the eye), is exceedingly rare with roughly 130 cases per year in the US and fewer than one in 1 million worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include irritation, redness or a sensation of something being stuck in the eye. As it progresses, it may lead to vision loss, blurry vision or a change in pupil size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uveal melanoma starts in the eye's middle layer, called the uvea. It is the most common eye cancer. Like the other forms of eye melanoma, the causes are unclear, but it is not thought to be influenced by UV light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the increase in melanoma cases since 1975. Deaths, however, have decreased slightly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowen said: 'It’s important to note that some of the most serious eye cancers, particularly uveal or ocular melanoma, often cause no pain or vision changes in the early and even mid stages. Uveal melanoma is life-threatening because the retina is an extension of the brain, providing a direct pathway for cancer to spread if it goes undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why annual comprehensive eye exams are essential, even when no symptoms are present. During every exam, doctors of optometry carefully examine the eye using specialized microscopes that can detect very small or early precancerous and cancerous lesions of the eye and surrounding structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many eye cancers are found during routine exams before symptoms ever develop, which greatly improves outcomes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there are no definitive cures for ocular melanoma, patients can be treated with a specialized laser therapy or plaque brachytherapy. These treatments kill the tumor and while doctors don't declare patients 'cured,' they are considered to be what is called NED, no evidence of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowen urged anyone who notices changes in their eyes or vision to visit an eye doctor as soon as possible, especially if symptoms last for several weeks or worsen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Early detection matters at every age, including in children, where rare but life-threatening eye cancers such as retinoblastoma may only be detected through a comprehensive eye exam,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Over the course of the next few days, from Dec. 31 to Jan. 2, both nurses developed high fevers and respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two were admitted to the intensive care unit at the same hospital where they work on Jan. 4 after their conditions worsened, the outlet reported. One of the nurses is now in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that an initial investigation suggests that both nurses caught the virus from a patient with severe respiratory symptoms. The patient died before they could be tested for Nipah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most likely source of infection is a patient who had been admitted to the same hospital previously," a senior health official involved in West Bengal's Nipah surveillance efforts told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Telegraph.&lt;/em&gt; "That individual is being treated as the suspected index case, and investigations are ongoing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said that 180 people in the region had been tested for Nipah as of Jan. 20, and 20 people who had high-risk contact with the two nurses have been quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigam told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;that every test came back negative thus far, and the people in quarantine will be tested again at the end of their 21-day isolation period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the serious nature of Nipah virus infection, which is a zoonotic disease with high mortality and potential for rapid spread, the situation is being handled with utmost priority," a senior Health Ministry official told the &lt;em&gt;Hindu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both local and nationwide agencies, including the country's National Centre for Disease Control, are now involved in the incident, and the investigation is still underway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindu &lt;/em&gt;reported on Saturday, Jan. 24, that officials were testing bats at Kolkata's Alipore Zoo to rule out infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from India's National Institute of Medical Research collected blood and swab samples from bats at the zoo over two days, a State Forest Department official told the outlet. RT-PCR tests, which test for genetic materials from viruses, are also being conducted on bats across various parts of West Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team collected swab samples from bats. They have followed all the protocols during the process," Alipore Zoo Director Tripti Sah said. Other officials told the outlet that preventative measures were put in place, and there is "no reason for immediate panic."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/nipah-virus-infection#tab=tab_1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), Nipah virus causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. It also causes severe disease in animals such as pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first recognized outbreak was detected in Malaysia in 1999. In that outbreak, 100 people died in both Malaysia and Singapore, and one million pigs were killed to prevent further spreading of the disease, which had severe economic consequences for farmers, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25085-nipah-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH-NIAID/Image Point FR/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty &lt;/p&gt; Nipah virus particles&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO states that Nipah transmission is thought to occur when people are exposed to secretions from animals or contact with the tissue of a sick animal. Some outbreaks were traced back to fruits or fruit products, such as juice, that were contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats. The illness can also be spread from human to human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has no vaccine or cure, and doctors can only treat the symptoms — which initially include fever, headaches, muscle soreness, vomiting and sore throat, before transforming into dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological issues linked to encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia and other respiratory problems can also occur, and the virus has an incubation period of four to 14 days. No cases have ever been reported in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who contract the virus make a full recovery, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but some patients have reported neurological conditions that result from encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's Ministry of Health has advised the public to take precautions amid the outbreak. In a social media post, the agency recommended that those in the region wear protective clothing whenever handling or cleaning animals and sheds, wash fruit before consuming it, protect sap and juice collection from bats, and avoid exposure to bats by not visiting areas such as abandoned buildings, caves or mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/officials-report-outbreak-of-deadly-nipah-virus-which-has-no-cure-11892039" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:55:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQSmp4WUNraE5kbU9qLTE3akw3ZEE1WnhkYWY0ZkdCTmxTX3FmUml6cldQUFBvTm1ybzhMbFFMSEVvQ2lWMU1pZmVyV2dPbnBsMlBRMHQ2RV9YVE15VUphTGxJSUwxRFVWS3UxWGdtSlFNdUFVQ2UzZUVrUXU0c0tZS2lsc1JBQl94SHc</guid></item><item><title>根据健身专家- EatingWell的说法，在50岁后进行6次平衡锻炼，以提高力量和稳定性</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/balance-exercises-to-boost-strength-and-stability-11891603</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice balance exercises at least two to three times per week to improve stability and balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start slowly, focus on form and use support as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As your balance improves, try increasing the difficulty or frequency of the exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may recall a time when standing on one foot, walking along a curb or jumping around felt effortless. But as we age, our body changes, and so does our balance. Balance loss is common with age due to natural declines in muscle strength, reaction time, proprioception and spatial awareness. "Balance starts declining for everyone at age 40 and more rapidly after 60 so we need to combat that age-related decline and train our balance to maximize our retention," says &lt;a href="https://ariesphysicaltherapy.com/about-us-best-physical-therapy-fort-lauderdale" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bill Kelley, D.P.T., ATC, CSCS, Cert. DN&lt;/a&gt;. These changes can make everyday tasks, like climbing stairs, reaching for items on a shelf or walking on uneven surfaces, feel more challenging or even dangerous. Nearly one in three older adults fall each year, with a quarter of those falls resulting in a serious injury such as a hip fracture.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although balance often declines after age 50, it doesn't have to be a given. Research shows that regular balance exercises can significantly improve stability in older adults.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Balance exercises should be a vital part of anyone's movement practice as we all age," says &lt;a href="https://hubphysicaltherapy.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Paul Fath, PT, D.P.T., OCS&lt;/a&gt;. "Regularly practicing and performing balance exercises will help to maintain better balance and slow the decline of balance-related events and injuries."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help you get started, here are six expert-recommended, beginner-friendly balance exercises to safely build strength and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These single-leg stands are easy to do at home and can transform your balance. "Most balance exercises work by challenging your stability, which trains your body to better sense its position in space. Single-leg stands are especially effective because your base of support is reduced, forcing your brain and muscles to work together to recalibrate your center of gravity," says &lt;a href="https://welltech.com/experts/molly-ruecker" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Molly Ruecker PT, D.P.T., SCS, ATC, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This exercise strengthens stabilizing muscles in the feet, ankles, hips and core, essential for daily movement and balance," she adds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stand near a counter, table, wall or sturdy chair for support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on your hips or lightly on the support if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift your left foot off the ground, raising your thigh toward parallel to the floor or as high as you can without losing balance. Keep your weight on the other leg and engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for 20 to 30 seconds, or as long as you comfortably can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower your left foot and switch to the right leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat 2 to 3 times per leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heel-to-toe walks are a game changer for balance. "I stress gait mechanics a lot. How your foot lands, how your toes are placed and how your muscles respond during movement all matter," &lt;a href="https://www.msfitnessstudio.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melanie Sinclair, CPT, PES, CES&lt;/a&gt; says. "Heel-to-toe walking helps improve how you move forward efficiently, whether you're walking, running, lunging or just moving through daily life."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stand tall and extend your arms out to the sides for balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place one foot directly in front of the other so the heel of your front foot touches the toes of your back foot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue stepping forward in this way for 5 to 10 steps, aiming to walk in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn around and walk back to your starting point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Walk heel-to-toe slowly, pausing briefly on each step to challenge balance and control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-sit-to-stand"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Sit-to-Stand &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting up and down from a chair is a daily activity most people perform many times a day. But as balance changes, this simple movement can become more difficult. "Sit-to-stand is a functional activity that is done throughout the day in self care and in positional changes," shares &lt;a href="https://activecarephysicaltherapy.com/staffs/dr-karena-wu/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Karena Wu, PT, D.P.T., OCS&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sit on a sturdy chair with your feet flat on the floor and hands resting on your lap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean slightly forward, engage your core and push through your heels to stand up fully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower back down to a seated position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat 10 to 15 times, resting as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tip: Move slowly and deliberately. Standing and lowering slowly helps your muscles engage and improves balance.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supported hip-hinges test what your balance is like while in motion. "As you hinge at the hips, your center of gravity shifts backwards and forwards, forcing the muscles to constantly adjust to keep you stable," shares Ruecker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Hip-hinges are also good for balance because they strengthen the core and posterior chain muscles, including the glutes, hamstrings and back, all of which are key muscles for controlling posture and movement. The light support is perfect for those who need an added feeling of safety, allowing them to practice proper form without the fear of failing," she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stand about one foot away from a wall, back facing it, with feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on your hips or lightly on the wall for support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hinge at your hips, gently pushing them back while keeping your back straight. Your glutes may lightly touch the wall to guide you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower until you feel a gentle stretch in your hamstrings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly push your hips forward to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat 10 to 15 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tip: Avoid bending your knees or leaning forward. Focus on hinging at the hips and gently pushing your glutes back.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Standing side leg raises help with lateral balance. "Standing leg raises improve your balance by shifting your weight onto one leg while the other moves outward, forcing your body to control side-to-side stability," explains Ruecker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The main working muscles are those on the outside of the standing hip, especially the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-exercise-for-better-blood-pressure-8619767" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gluteus medius&lt;/a&gt;, which keep your pelvis level and prevent you from tipping or collapsing inward. At the same time, your core and supporting ankle muscles will make small adjustments to keep your body stacked over the base of support. This trains your body to manage lateral balance and alignment," she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Perform side leg raises without support or use a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/stretches-to-do-every-day-to-help-undo-sitting-11849140" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loop resistance band&lt;/a&gt; just above your knees.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting up and down the stairs can become a difficult task as we age, but step-ups can help you feel confident going up and down flights. "Step-ups are an important unilateral strength and balance activity that mimics stair climbing and descent," says Wu. "It emphasizes the use of multiple joints and muscles in the leg to step up and down with control and good kinetic alignment."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_76-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She adds, "This can help reduce falls if someone trips and lands on a single leg.

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_80-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use a sturdy step, stair or step box about half a foot (6 inches) high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand facing the step, holding a railing or placing a hand on a wall for support if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place your left foot on the step and push through your heel to bring your right foot up to meet it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step down with your right foot, keeping your left foot on the step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat 10 to 15 times per leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_82-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tip: When you push through your heel, you should feel your glutes doing most of the work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_83-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_84-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a higher step box or hold a dumbbell in the hand opposite the stepping leg to increase challenge.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_87-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reduce the risk of falls or injury, keep these safety tips in mind:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_88-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_89-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Support When Needed.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep a wall, sturdy chair or counter nearby to hold onto until you feel stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Your Space.&lt;/strong&gt; "To reduce the risk of tripping, ensure the area is tidy and free of clutter," says Ruecker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear Proper Shoes.&lt;/strong&gt; Supportive, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/podiatrist-approved-non-slip-shoes-11829338" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;non-slip footwear&lt;/a&gt; can prevent slips and improve stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Slow.&lt;/strong&gt; Perform exercises at a controlled pace, as rushing increases the risk of losing balance. "Starting simple, listening to your body and slowly increasing the difficulty are also great ways to stay safe while still making progress," shares Ruecker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage Your Core.&lt;/strong&gt; A strong, engaged core helps support better balance and control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress Gradually.&lt;/strong&gt; Increase the difficulty only when you can perform the exercise confidently and safely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Your Gaze.&lt;/strong&gt; Looking at a fixed point ahead, such as a picture on the wall, can help improve stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek Professional Help.&lt;/strong&gt; A physical therapist or certified &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-exercise-combo-to-lose-visceral-fat-11880936" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;personal trainer&lt;/a&gt; can provide personalized recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_90-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-often-should-you-do-balance-exercises"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_91-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Often Should You Do Balance Exercises? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_92-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports this recommendation, showing that older adults who practice balance training three times per week experience improved stability and a lower risk of falls.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "The best frequency for performing balance exercises is the frequency that you can perform consistently," says Fath. "When included in your regular exercise program, I would suggest at least 2 to 3 days per week."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_93-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_97-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining and improving balance is important at any age, but it becomes especially important after 50. Adding balance exercises to your routine can help strengthen muscles, prevent falls and make everyday movements feel easier. Focus on slow, controlled movements and proper form, and progress to more challenging variations only when you can perform each exercise confidently. For best results, aim to practice balance exercises a few times per week.

			&lt;p&gt;In preparation for winter, the common shrew (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_shrew"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorex araneus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-animal-can-shrink-its-brain-and-we-finally-know-how"&gt;shrinks its brain&lt;/a&gt; by 30 percent to conserve precious energy. Then, come spring, the shrew miraculously 'regrows' its shrivelled brain, neurons fully intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now traced the evolutionary origins of this rare adaptation and the genes that likely enable it. While fascinating in its own right, this information may also spark new approaches to understanding and treating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;human brain degeneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-stem-cell-secrets-of-this-tiny-worm-could-help-unlock-human-regeneration"&gt;The Stem Cell Secrets of This Tiny Worm Could Help Unlock Human Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual adaptation is known as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.04.006"&gt;Dehnel's phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;, named for Polish zoologist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Dehnel"&gt;August Dehnel&lt;/a&gt;, who first described the shrew's remarkable brain-shrinking ability, a method of coping with the seasonal energy shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dehnel's phenomenon is rare, but shrews aren't the only practitioners: European moles (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_mole"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talpa europaea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), common weasels (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_weasel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mustela nivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and stoats (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mustela erminea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) also reduce their brain size with the seasons. These mammals all have fast metabolisms, and they don't hibernate, which may explain why they take such drastic measures to reduce their energy needs when food is short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecologist William Thomas, from Stony Brook University in the US, led a study to map the common shrew's entire genome, comparing it to those of other mammals who also exhibit Dehnel's phenomenon to see what genetic tricks they have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study builds on the team's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-animal-can-shrink-its-brain-and-we-finally-know-how"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at seasonal changes in gene expression in two parts of the shrew's brain, and determined which sections of DNA were more active – and therefore possibly involved – during these massive bodily shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189566" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-642x428.jpeg" alt="a tiny brown shrew is peeking out of a biologist's 'trap' box, held up to the camera with a blue gloved hand about four times the size of the shrew." class="size-medium wp-image-189566" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-642x428.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-1012x675.jpeg 1012w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/original-1-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189566" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In 2025, researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.08.015"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that the shrew's seasonal brain shrinkage is caused by water loss, and yet brain cells survive.

Its genome was also enriched with genes associated with DNA repair and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water-regulation genes were also active, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.08.015"&gt;supporting theories&lt;/a&gt; that shrews achieve reversible loss of brain volume &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25258209/0827-ornr-rare-seasonal-brain-shrinkage-in-shrews-is-driven-by-water-loss-not-cell-death-987453-x"&gt;by losing water&lt;/a&gt;, not net brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The findings point to "a finely tuned system that enables common shrews to reversibly regulate brain shrinkage while avoiding the detrimental effects typically associated with neurodegeneration," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msag006"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell biologist Aurora Ruiz-Herrera from the Autonomous University of Barcelona &lt;a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/-1345830290613.html?detid=1345974943963"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;: "The role of genes related to energy homeostasis and the blood-brain barrier points to possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-start-at-the-brains-borders-scientists-discover"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, always with the necessary caution when extrapolating to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msag006"&gt;Molecular Biology and Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We tend to think marital happiness depends on personality, luck or years of careful maintenance. But when the data is examined, a less romantic and far more intriguing picture emerges. Paradoxically, the years in which we expect to feel most fulfilled, the years of starting a family and raising children, are precisely the years when relationship satisfaction declines. Only much later, when it seems the hardest part is behind us, does it begin to rise again.

There are exceptions, of course, but when you look at the averages, the best is still ahead of us. Most of us will be happier later in life, and that is good news. The problem is that most of us are now deep inside what I call the “valley of death”, meaning most of us have children, and we are asking ourselves, “What happened to us?”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="68ogp-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="68ogp-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="68ogp-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;If this pattern repeats itself among so many couples, the obvious question is not only what happened, but how it happened. Prof. Yovell shifts the discussion away from individual psychology toward the broader social structure, suggesting that the decline in parental and marital happiness is not a personal failure but the result of a deep historical shift in how we live, raise children and build families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="1otgt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1otgt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1otgt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;‘I think it happened without any bad intentions, but we are in the middle of a very large social experiment,’ he says. ‘Until the Industrial Revolution, almost all human beings lived in extended families, which is probably how our species evolved. When you look at the animals closest to us, the apes we evolved from, and when you look at early human societies, everyone lived in three-generation extended families, with grandparents, parents and children living together. To this day, that is how people live in traditional societies. That was the default for all humans everywhere.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="8jnkk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8jnkk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8jnkk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The Industrial Revolution, he explains, changed the rules of the game. ‘Several things happened. Mobility increased. Until then, people lived more or less where they were born. They were born in a village and lived there their entire lives, and even if they left, they usually returned. From this emerged a new way of life that we now take for granted, but simply did not exist 200 years ago: the nuclear family, a two-generation family of parents and children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="3n1d5-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.H1ei1ysfIWl" id="image_ArticleImageData.H1ei1ysfIWl"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.H1ei1ysfIWl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/19/S1WCgsir11x/S1WCgsir11x_0_0_1000_668_0_x-large.jpg" alt="זוג לא מאושר" title="'Most of the time we feel guilty, and rightly so'  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.H1ei1ysfIWl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/19/S1WCgsir11x/S1WCgsir11x_0_0_1000_668_0_x-large.jpg" alt="זוג לא מאושר" title="'Most of the time we feel guilty, and rightly so'  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;'Most of the time we feel guilty, and rightly so' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="9j3ln-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9j3ln-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9j3ln-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;‘Why does this matter? Because in nuclear families, raising children becomes a zero-sum game. In traditional societies, there is always someone who can step in when the father is at work and the mother is at the end of her rope: an aunt, a grandfather, a neighbor, someone who is not one of the two parents, who is available and can help with the children. Today, we no longer have that.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="bdv0q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bdv0q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bdv0q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The shift from extended families to nuclear families was not the only change brought by industrialization. At the same time, the way children grow up, and the amount of time they spend with their parents, also changed. ‘Before the Industrial Revolution, children spent most of their time with their parents. Boys went out to the fields or hunted with their fathers and learned their trade from them. Girls stayed with their mothers, helped with household tasks and learned how to be mothers themselves. They were with us, we raised them, and they learned how to function from us,’ Prof. Yovell explains. ‘Once we started sending them to schools and we were no longer with them, we began to feel guilty, and rightly so. All parenting guides and psychologists tell us how important it is to be with our children, which is true. Then every free moment outside of work comes with enormous pressure to be with them all the time. ‘This is especially true in Israel. We are a society that sanctifies children more than other Western societies. We constantly feel guilty that we have not done enough and that we need to do more for them.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="64s0l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="64s0l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="64s0l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In other words, the daily reality of modern parenting places an extreme psychological burden on parents. ‘If you look at your children and mine, who are they with? Either with their father, their mother, or with someone we pay: teachers, instructors, educators, kindergarten teachers, caregivers. Someone on the payroll. This creates a very heavy mental burden for parents. ‘I will say something extreme. The role of parenting, which has always been difficult throughout history, has become almost impossible in recent years. Those who pay the highest price are mothers, women, because they have taken on an entire new set of responsibilities and challenges, without any meaningful reduction in the load placed on them by raising children. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="text_editor_block_quote" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="7fh86-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7fh86-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7fh86-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;'Because the country is small and because we still retain traces of a traditional society, grandparents here are more involved in raising children and grandchildren than in other Western countries, particularly the United States. This is likely one of the key reasons Israel’s happiness levels are genuinely among the highest in the world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="2pej6-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2pej6-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2pej6-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;‘Many fathers have their work, and work becomes the ultimate mistress. A person works long hours and is not at home, and he says, with some justification, what do you want from me? I am providing. Someone has to keep this whole thing going. If the mother is the primary breadwinner, and the father still goes to his job and does not stay home, and there are no active grandparents and no paid caregiver whose job it is, then the mother is left with an impossible burden.’ This burden is not merely theoretical. It is a daily reality Prof. Yovell has encountered in his clinical work. ‘I no longer do this, but for many years I worked as a therapist in New York. I had a patient who was a senior executive at one of the major Wall Street firms. One day she came into my office, sat down, looked at me and said, “Dr. Yovell, I need a wife.” That is where many women find themselves today.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="5fj2c-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.HyxBFljGIZe" id="image_ArticleImageData.HyxBFljGIZe"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HyxBFljGIZe" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/19/SJmyClsoBbe/SJmyClsoBbe_0_67_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="הורות" title="Mothers are coping with an impossible burden  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HyxBFljGIZe" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/19/SJmyClsoBbe/SJmyClsoBbe_0_67_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="הורות" title="Mothers are coping with an impossible burden  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Mothers are coping with an impossible burden &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="7pm75-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7pm75-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7pm75-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Still, this picture is not identical everywhere. Much of the research informing our understanding of parental and marital happiness comes from countries where family structures are even more fragmented and distant than in Israel. ‘Most of the studies we have come from Western countries, especially the United States. These are very large countries, where people often see their grandparents only during the holiday season, between Thanksgiving and the New Year,’ Prof. Yovell says. ‘The situation in Israel is better, because the country is small and because we still retain traces of a traditional society. Compared to other Western countries, grandparents here are more involved in raising children and grandchildren than in the United States, where grandparents may live in Florida while the family lives in Los Angeles and see each other once a year. ‘That is probably one of the important reasons why happiness levels in Israel are genuinely among the highest in the world. But we are still a Western country, with all the caveats, and it is still very hard to be a parent here.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="f6rj8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f6rj8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f6rj8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Another feature that slightly distinguishes Israel from other Western societies, he says, is the attraction to community-based living. ‘Until October 7, communities near the Gaza border had far more people wanting to live there than they could actually absorb. Parents are looking for a community where children can function in the afternoons without parents having to provide transportation and entertainment, or without children being stuck in front of smartphones, which we know is not good for them.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="3jgm6-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3jgm6-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3jgm6-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The shift in family structure and parenting has not only weighed heavily on daily life but has also had a direct impact on the intimate core of the couple’s relationship. “What are the variables that predict how satisfied both partners are with the quality of their romantic lives?” Prof. Yovell asked, before offering the answer. “The striking finding is that it is most strongly correlated with the number of hours the father spends with the children. That is fascinating, it explains a great deal, and it also offers hope, because it tells you exactly what you need to do to make things better,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="9ggl3-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9ggl3-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9ggl3-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This link between couplehood, parenthood and children’s well-being also lies at the heart of the extensive research conducted by Prof. John Gottman, one of the world’s leading scholars on relationships and family life. Over decades of research, Gottman sought to examine not only what people say about their relationships, but what actually happens inside them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="4uepd-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SkgsKzozLZx" id="image_ArticleImageData.SkgsKzozLZx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SkgsKzozLZx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/19/Skb1RejiHZg/Skb1RejiHZg_0_0_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="זוג לא מאושר" title="We have to find a way, somehow, to preserve romantic love between partners  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SkgsKzozLZx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/19/Skb1RejiHZg/Skb1RejiHZg_0_0_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="זוג לא מאושר" title="We have to find a way, somehow, to preserve romantic love between partners  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;We have to find a way, somehow, to preserve romantic love between partners &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="4dsba-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4dsba-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4dsba-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Prof. Gottman’s research found that romantic love between parents is the child’s true cradle,” Prof. Yovell said. “Couples who did not abandon their relationship in favor of total focus on the children were not only happier themselves, their children were happier as well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="4j0t4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4j0t4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4j0t4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One reason Gottman’s work is considered particularly reliable, Yovell explained, is his unusual methodology. “He did not settle for what people told him. Instead of relying solely on self-reporting, as most psychological research does through questionnaires, he also measured actual behavior over time. “As part of his research, he invited couples, and later entire families, to what was known as the ‘Love Lab,’ a fully equipped apartment owned by the University of Washington in Seattle, located in a pleasant neighborhood overlooking the harbor. They stayed there for a weekend at the university’s expense. It was very much like ‘Big Brother.’ They gave full consent to be filmed and recorded everywhere except the bathroom and bedroom throughout the weekend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="text_editor_block_quote" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="6ssbb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6ssbb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6ssbb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;'All couples who divorce began with immense love for one another and a genuine desire to give everything to each other. The question is how you move from point A to point B, from the person you chose above all others and were truly willing to do anything for, to a place where you cannot stand them and feel you must separate, despite the enormous social costs'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="41mum-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="41mum-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="41mum-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This process was repeated over many years. “He took a young couple in the first year after marriage, then followed up five years later after their first child was born, and then another five years later with two or three children, and compared the results. Much of what we know today comes from these findings, especially the insight that the amount of time parents spend with each other has a major impact.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="aig8r-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="aig8r-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="aig8r-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The conclusion, Yovell stressed, is not romantic but practical. “Couples must actively protect their love. What happens naturally and effortlessly at the beginning later requires care and intention, because it no longer happens on its own. Life’s wear and tear is simply too great. “Parents who hover over their children 24/7 under the belief that this is what is best for them are mistaken. The love between the two of you is what gives your children their deepest sense of security.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="9r827-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9r827-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9r827-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;From there, he said, the path to relationship breakdown can be short. “There are situations in which separation is truly the right choice, cases where the conflicts are simply too severe. But it is important to remember that every couple who divorces began with enormous love for one another and a genuine desire to give everything to each other. “The question is how we move from point A to point B, from the person we chose above all others and were willing to do anything for, to a situation where we cannot stand them and feel we must separate, despite the enormous social costs.” Here, too, Gottman’s research offered an answer. “He found that what we usually think of as the causes of divorce, such as an affair that comes to light or a shocking financial secret, are actually just triggers. What happened beforehand was a gradual erosion of romantic love over many years. “Then something occurs that, had it happened at the beginning of the relationship, the couple could have survived.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="bh251-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bh251-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bh251-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Gottman compares romantic love to a bank account. “We begin with a large positive balance. But the challenges of raising children lead to repeated withdrawals, and if we do not make regular deposits, small and frequent investments, we can end up overdrawn. “One of Gottman’s strongest recommendations is to strengthen the couple relationship, for example by going on a weekly date, once a week. It sounds very small, but it is critically important. At the beginning we did this often. Later we are simply too tired, busy with the children, and we say, ‘Let’s just watch something on Netflix.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="8l0pc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8l0pc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8l0pc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“But if we stay at home, we remain wrapped in all the habits of the household.

You are not being selfish. You are also taking care of them. “You simply have to put on the oxygen mask,” he said, invoking the familiar airline safety instruction. “We all know the announcement before every flight, that if there is a drop in cabin pressure and oxygen masks fall, you should put the mask on yourself first and only then on your child. Every mother hears this and says, ‘Are you serious? Me first and only then my child?’ “The answer is that this is exactly what you should do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6kdba" data-offset-key="ebo0q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ebo0q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ebo0q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Imagine the moment it actually happens. There is a loss of cabin pressure, the masks drop, and the plane eventually makes an emergency landing on water. Now everyone has to get out quickly before the plane sinks. Who has a better chance? A fully alert child wearing a mask, lying in the arms of an unconscious mother? Or an unconscious child in the arms of an alert, clear-headed mother wearing a mask, who can lift the child and get out of the plane in time? “First take care of yourselves and of each other, so that together you can take care of the children,” he concluded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ynetnews.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:02:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9mdDEwNjV4NDl6VzVWaWRUTFhCSmc5SVRRckF2Y0VhN0o5dXhseGp5NVpYRkdIb09kb2hfVUhONDVSQjRuSUJaaVFnalROamF4Snc3bl9LSFpGU3BGV21DaU9VN0NkTU10Wk9zS29B</guid></item><item><title>在堪萨斯州社区废水中检测到6种高浓度病毒- hayspost.com</title><link>https://hayspost.com/posts/737cea8b-a085-43e3-a2ab-b59cc43b3eea</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="p-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-loose"&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-1/2" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2022/12/1671049425198.jpg" alt="Image Pixaby"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Image Pixaby&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lawrence sees early flu peak as some health care providers require masking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By:&lt;a href="https://kansasreflector.com/author/mayasmith/"&gt;Maya Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/02/24/gov-laura-kelly-skeptical-kansas-houses-anti-tenure-legislation-will-reach-her-desk/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kansas Reflector&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAWRENCE — Six viral diseases — including COVID-19, the flu and norovirus — have been found at high concentrations in Lawrence wastewater as Kansas communities face peak flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19, influenza A and B, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and norovirus have all been detected at high concentrations in Lawrence &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/4niF8mr" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; within the last three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data indicates trends of illnesses spreading within a community but does not correlate to exact case numbers, with doctors saying it’s normal to see high concentrations of respiratory illness during flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater data does not measure individual cases, but it provides a reliable picture of how much virus is circulating in a community,” said Veronica White, preparedness and epidemiology coordinator for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health. “This data captures viral genetic material shed by everyone using the sewer system. One factor that may be contributing to the higher concentrations of respiratory viruses seen in Lawrence’s wastewater is its larger population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence is also seeing an early peak in influenza B compared to the rest of the country. Positive flu tests spiked the last week of 2025, with 32% of total flu tests coming back positive, according to data from the University of Kansas Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health care providers such as Watkins Health Center at the University of Kansas are requiring masks for all visitors, patients and staff due to a “record surge in respiratory illnesses,” according to a sign at the front door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White said early rise in the flu doesn’t indicate a more dangerous flu season, but rather earlier circulation of the virus than usual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying this trend early through wastewater data allows people to take preventive steps, such as getting vaccinated, monitoring symptoms, and staying home when sick,” White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data also indicated that a newer strain of COVID, known as the XFG or the Stratus variant, has accounted for 82.5% of positive COVID samples, with concentrations increasing by 25% in the last month. The variant has also been increasing nationally, White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Hawkinson, medical director for Infection Control and Prevention program at University of Kansas Health System, said there are still large populations of people across the state who have not received a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been a large number of people ill and circulators too in our communities. But (the flu) still remains at a high level at this point in time,” Hawkinson said. “There have been extremely low numbers of people not getting the vaccine. We know that we can help prevent this and people’s chances of severe illness and death with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Stites, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System, said that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7chEnUW0EI?si=2KN1bC2byLQI_f0H&amp;amp;t=678" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said flu symptoms include fever, cough, congestion, body aches and a sore throat rather than stomach bug symptoms, with the definitions often getting mixed up during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data has also indicated that Salina is seeing medium concentrations of the same illnesses, except for influenza A, which is considered to be at a high concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the data, we expect viral activity to continue in both Lawrence and Salina over the next few weeks,” White said. “As we move through flu season, we anticipate seeing elevated influenza activity reflected in the wastewater, especially as the season approaches its typical peak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts continue to advise washing hands, covering coughs and not going into large public spaces when sick to prevent illnesses from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can still go get the flu vaccine,” Hawkinson said. “It’s still recommended, and you can do it now to protect yourself from infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>hayspost.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:04:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9KN2lSbVhfVkxHa1M5VUVPZnhKVjRwNUczeTg4TGJ6emVtbm9jSVp2QnFNWTRSVlJSWVNSdkpDdUhrN3Z3ZmJtVlhMekFwYVNpTzNzXzdfRmlxeWRjdlBGX0Y2VzBsZnhuR0ZRTE5oODU</guid></item><item><title>拔出向内生长的头发，然后有4%的机会从昏迷中苏醒过来的男性- LADbible</title><link>https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/texas-man-coma-sepsis-brain-dead-removing-ingrown-hair-recovery-593066-20260124</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Moving footage captured the moment a man woke from a coma a month after his loved ones were told he was likely brain dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctors feared the worst for &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; dad Steven Spinale after he was rushed to hospital, as they had initially 'couldn't figure out what was wrong with him', according to his sister Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She explained that he was admitted in 2022 after weeks of being 'pretty sick', but all medics were able to determine was that he was 'bleeding internally from somewhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Little did we know that would be the smallest worry," Michelle wrote in a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-steven-fight-for-his-life"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; post at the time.

(Krepelova et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus was on intestinal crypts, small pockets in the gut lining that house stem cells that renew the intestinal lining. Experiments showed that ACCA drift originates within these stem cells and then expands as crypts divide and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's happening: increased inflammation, reduced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"&gt;growth signaling&lt;/a&gt;, and reduced iron levels in intestinal crypt stem cells combine to disrupt the processes that tidy up methylation, leading to genes being deactivated – in a way that potentially allows &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/targeting-the-cancer-stem-cell-could-be-key-to-better-treatments"&gt;cancer to develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, more and more areas with an older epigenetic profile develop in the tissue," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news/as-our-gut-age-new-study-finds-out-why-important-genes-go-quiet-as-we-get-older"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Anna Krepelova, from the University of Turin. "Through the natural process of crypt division, these regions continuously enlarge and can continue to grow over many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When there's not enough iron in the cells, faulty markings remain on the DNA. And the cells lose their ability to remove these markings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stem cell-driven crypts divide and multiply, patches of tissue with older, cancer-prone epigenetic profiles gradually expand. This creates more unhealthy pockets throughout the gut over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation, iron imbalance, and lower growth signaling can accelerate epigenetic drift, meaning the aging process and increased vulnerability to cancer can happen earlier in the gut than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These danger zones will vary between people, as does &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/walking-daily-linked-to-lower-risk-of-13-cancers-major-study-finds"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, but now we know more about how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-medicine-may-stop-colorectal-cancer-from-returning"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; gets more opportunities to start as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, in organoids, the researchers were able to slow and even partially reverse epigenetic drift by boosting iron uptake or restoring specific cell growth signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that epigenetic aging does not have to be a fixed, final state," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news/as-our-gut-age-new-study-finds-out-why-important-genes-go-quiet-as-we-get-older"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Krepelova.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksealum000a3b7bywgye87z@published"&gt;My friend, “Angela”, who is in her 30s, is the first of my friends to have a baby. Her circle is small, and so is her fiancé’s. He is new to the state. They decided to try for a baby after just six months of dating, and will be wed this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksealwz000b3b7bwo2w5sxf@published"&gt;Angela is a hippie, and a victim of abuse at the hands of her father, brother, and past partners. One partner in particular was conspiratorial, and as a result, she has never received a COVID vaccine. In 2022, I was unable to see her before my abortion in the case that I might need surgery—I couldn’t risk contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksealz6000c3b7blcr322gu@published"&gt;During her pregnancy, we talked about vaccination, and Angela told our friend group she intended on getting the baby vaccinated. She also told us she would get the Tdap shot during her pregnancy, though she never confirmed actually having done so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkseam1g000d3b7bgapsqsxl@published"&gt;Angela is now a stay-at-home mom with a four-month-old baby. I love this baby. I love the title of “auntie.” But Angela is becoming overprotective and delusional. She has no media literacy and is sharing anti-vaccine posts on Facebook. When challenged, she thanks me for my help, but it rings hollow. She talks often about “hating Trump,” but is now parroting a lot of his ideals. I can’t be friends with someone who doesn’t vaccinate their baby! How can I get through to her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="1" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkseam68000f3b7bvzjsk7cd@published"&gt;—Vaccinated&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksecyl2000p3b7bwu8lwwt8@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Vaccinated,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksed31r000u3b7be07orskk@published"&gt;Few things going on here! But the most glaring is that your friend’s baby is &lt;em&gt;four months old, &lt;/em&gt;meaning your friend is just &lt;em&gt;four-months postpartum. &lt;/em&gt;This is a hard, hard time for her—she’s isolated, she’s sleep deprived, her body and hormones are still doing strange things, and she’s got this living creature to take care of. You call her “overprotective and delusional,” but another way to put that might be “suffering from postpartum depression.” (Not a doctor! Just musing here, but like, c’mon.)&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkskwx3q003p3b7bliufjnyr@published"&gt;Right now, the best thing you could do for your friend would be to encourage her to speak to her doctor about how she’s feeling. And the next best thing would be to just be there for her, listen to her, be compassionate, and supportive, and yes, offer one IRL data point of dissent on the vax front (e.g., when she brings it up or posts about it, simply reply: “I’ve read the same stuff you have. And I still believe vaccinations save lives,” or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksg8olw003g3b7bm4qyhb60@published"&gt;As for “getting through to her” beyond that—good luck. We live in an information hellhole right now. Her media illiteracy and vax hesitancy is the result of societal failure, not her own personal or moral shortcoming. Her baby’s pediatrician will have many opportunities, and some authority, to talk her about vaccines. And there will (likely, probably, definitely, depending on where you live) be many checks in the future that could spur vaccination: daycare registration, school registration, camp registration. This isn’t your problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksl0frn003t3b7b3smdcrrm@published"&gt;But if this is a red line for you, then sure, tell her that and peace out. It sounds like you might be looking for a reason to do that anyway—judgment for your pal is just oozing from your letter, before you even mention vaccines. Your friend could definitely use a friend, but it doesn’t have to be you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkseajw4002ecvkkc88h50gq@published"&gt;I’m a personal assistant to a highly accomplished woman a few years older than me whom I admire and respect a great deal. I’ve worked with her for five years, and we have a close professional relationship. This weekend, we were together late one night when she confided in me how lonely she was; the long hours we work make it difficult for her to maintain a relationship, and she has few friends nearby. Then she told me how good it was to have someone she could confide in and how grateful she was that she could speak to me in confidence. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/01/dear-prudence-im-falling-in-love-with-my-boss.html"&gt;She gave me a look that under any other circumstance I would have taken as an invitation to kiss her. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleobt00173b7cu526hkp1@published"&gt;My husband and I went over to his parents’ for the Christmas holiday. His mother has never been particularly respectful of boundaries, but we thought we were safe to go at it at nearly 3 a.m. There’s no way she’d be up, then, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksllz6c00233b7c4l8qdomg@published"&gt;My MIL decided there was something she just HAD to ask us that couldn’t wait until the next day, and she walked in on us. Things were rather awkward in the morning, but I thought it was just one of those dumb things and that would be the end of it. Instead it’s been the end of our sex life, namely the fact that my husband hasn’t been able to get it up since the incident. I’ve tried everything—pussy shaving, sexy lingerie, sucking his dick—nothing works. Both of us are extremely worried and don’t know what to do. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleoly001a3b7ciz8qjcqf@published"&gt;Please relax. Not a lot of time has passed, and you’ve pinpointed a cause for the E.D. Plenty of people with non-working dicks and their partners write into this column having no idea why it’s happening. You at least have a leg up. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;dick up t&lt;/em&gt;hat you desire, but it’s something.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleop4001b3b7ckpe56478@published"&gt;Here’s what I would try: Work on eliminating the intrusive thoughts of this incident. This could be accomplished via therapy and/or a meditation practice. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/wife-secret-sex-toy-advice-tracking.html"&gt;I went into my practice in a previous column&lt;/a&gt;, so visit that page for tips. I have found that building the meditation muscle gives me the ability to pick and choose what my mind focuses on. It’s not 100 percent (I have not completely eliminated being haunted by disturbing thoughts or images) but I am doing much better than I did before, and I didn’t even know it was possible to not think about things that were bothering me. Your impulse to do whatever you can to help the matter is heartening and logical, but this issue may be above your pay grade. This is especially so if the root of the cause is, as it seems to be, that he feels “caught,” ashamed, like his boundaries were crossed, or like he’s somehow now associating sex with his mom. This is where working with a therapist/coach could really help. Couples counseling could be an option, but this may be something he mostly handles on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleotl001c3b7curxc3zf7@published"&gt;I would also get your husband some kind of wood-boosting assistance. Physiologically, he may not really need a PDE5 inhibitor like Viagra and/or a cock ring, but just having them can allay the anxiety that comes with and further exacerbates erectile dysfunction. Boner pills tend to be well-tolerated, and while some guys experience side effects (to the point of making the drugs off-putting), I think trying them is worth the small risk here—just to get him over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleoxs001d3b7c4suc4f9y@published"&gt;Also, try focusing on sex that doesn’t require his penis to be hard. Maybe that means he focuses on you orally/manually or that you introduce toys. Play in that space for a bit. Allowing him to get comfortable with this kind of contact may take the edge off and he may find himself able to perform. Again, this boner-killing event was fairly recent so giving it some time is also likely going to be useful. Patience!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not really my thing, but I agreed to give it a shot because I really like him. We’ve had our ups and downs, but our biggest hangup is that he doesn’t want to give me “veto” power over who he sleeps with. That hasn’t been a problem, really—until now. Recently, he told me he’s very attracted to my friend, and wants to hook up with her. I, um, hate this. For some reason, it’s making me super jealous, but I agreed to a relationship structure where he gets to do what he wants. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/boyfriend-relationship-rules-friend-sex-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Last week, officials at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) announced that health authorities in Guinea-Bissau had moved to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-rfk-africa-vaccines"&gt;halt a controversial study&lt;/a&gt; which would have used unvaccinated infants as lab rats. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), however, insisted the trial was still on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That wasn’t all US health authorities had to say. In a bizarre outburst, the HHS &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-hhs-africa-cdc"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the Africa CDC was a “fake and powerless organization,” and insisted that it was “not a reliable source” for information. During a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jhDb-r2jDc" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;press meeting&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, director-general of the Africa CDC Jean Kaseya hit back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Let me tell you: we are not an NGO,” Kaseya said defiantly. “We are not a UN organization. We are the convening power in Africa. The mandate [is] given to us by all 55 African heads of state and government.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“People can meet in the US, people can meet in Europe,” Kaseya continued, likely referencing &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/danish-vaccine-study-emails-hhs-rfk-jr-1235498456/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;leaked emails&lt;/a&gt; between HHS officials and Danish researchers to push the vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau. “If we are not there, they are wasting their time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Kaseya also made it clear that no government has the right to impose experiments on the people of Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Africa CDC is respecting and supporting the sovereignty of the country,” the official continued. “It’s not Africa CDC that will say, ‘this clinical trial will take place or not.’ It’s not any other international body that will come to say, ‘this clinical trial will take place or not.’ It’s not a foreign country that will come and say, ‘this one will take place.’ It’s the sovereignty of the country.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Though the HHS evidently thinks it has the power to push dangerous vaccines experiments on African countries, the reality isn’t so simple. According to the &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-guidance-for-any-clinical-trial-to-be-conducted-in-africa/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Africa CDC’s guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, any vaccine trial that doesn’t receive a written authorization from the country’s National Medicines Regulatory Authority is illegal. Likewise, it must have approval from the National Ethics Committee, as well as a local institutional review board at each site where the trial is to take place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;On top of all that, any trial must also have explicit approval from the country’s Ministry of Health — granting officials in Guinea-Bissau the power to functionally veto any experiment the government doesn’t support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Kaseya emphasized the importance of exercising sovereignty over African public health. “Our vision is not coming from Western countries,” he said. “Our vision is coming from Africa, shaped by African leadership, based on African realities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/23/guinea-bissau-hepatitis-b-vaccine-study" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;interview with the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Abdulhammad Babatunde, a doctor and global health researcher in Nigeria, said that it’s “very important to fund research that Africans actually want.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Africans want to solve Africa’s problems, not satisfy the curiosity of the funders,” Babatunde said, referring to the HHS, which announced the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23245/notice-of-award-of-a-single-source-unsolicited-grant-to-fund-university-of-southern-denmark-sdu#page-59125" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;$1.6 million funding package&lt;/a&gt; for the study in December. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Once up and running, the vaccine trial would have given 7,000 newborn children a vaccine for hepatitis B, while 7,000 more infants in the control group wouldn’t receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; notes, nearly one in five adults and 11 percent of children in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B — which carries a significant risk for debilitating illness and death. In such a health environment, there’s no justification for purposefully leaving infants unvaccinated for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This is not acceptable,” Babatunde told the paper. “To prevent things like the Tuskegee study and others, the control group has to get the standard of care, and the intervention group should get [potentially] better care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Asked whether the HHS’s comments would affect future collaboration with Africa CDC, Kaseya said he’s putting the strange episode behind him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“I was briefed that they don’t know anything about any statement against Africa CDC,” he said. “I could tell you about a statement that could be somewhere, made by someone. But officials from HHS just yesterday — senior people — said they don’t know anything about the statement. I trust them, I’ve closed the chapter.”&lt;/p&gt;
