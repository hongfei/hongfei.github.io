						&lt;strong class="dateline"&gt;FRANKLIN, Mass. —&lt;/strong&gt; 													&lt;p&gt;A Franklin, Massachusetts, restaurant closed Tuesday night after its staff came down with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Teddy Gallagher's made the call to shut down, even on the restaurant's busy Trivia Tuesday, when the head chef and another chef were sickened with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;

There can be a small cognitive boost &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30560422/"&gt;immediately after a workout&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6404470/"&gt;effects are sustained&lt;/a&gt; if people &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7357295/"&gt;exercise consistently&lt;/a&gt;. And while staying active can’t guarantee you won’t develop dementia, over the long term, it is associated with a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841638"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Researchers think that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40157803/"&gt;moving your muscles benefits your brain&lt;/a&gt; in part because of special signaling molecules called exerkines. During and after a workout, your muscles, fat and other organs release these molecules into the bloodstream, some of which make their way up to the brain. There, those exerkines go to work, helping to facilitate the growth of new connections between neurons, the repair of brain cells and, possibly, the birth of new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Exercise also appears to improve blood flow in the brain. That ramps up the delivery of good things to brain cells, like oxygen, glucose and those amazing exerkines. And it helps remove more bad things, namely toxic proteins, like amyloid, that can build up and damage brain cells, increasing the risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;All of the changes brought on by exercise are “essentially allowing your brain to age more slowly than if you’re physically inactive,” said Kirk Erickson, the chair of neuroscience at the AdventHealth Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The benefits are particularly pronounced in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory. In older adults, the hippocampus shrinks 1 to 2 percent a year, and it is one of the main areas affected by Alzheimer’s. Researchers think physical activity helps to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/"&gt;offset some of that loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The best exercise you can do for your brain is the one you’ll do consistently, so find something that you enjoy and that fits easily into your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Walking is one option; two neurologists I spoke to said they got their exercise in by walking at least part of the way to their offices. Recent research suggests that just &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/well/mind/dementia-steps-study.html"&gt;a few thousand steps a day&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of dementia. It’s important to get your heart rate up, though, so “walk as though you’re trying to get somewhere on time,” said Dr. Linda Selwa, a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Or you could try swimming, cycling, Pilates, weight lifting, yoga, pickleball, dancing, gardening — any type of physical exertion can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;If the thought of working out feels like a drag, try pairing it with something else you enjoy doing, like listening to an audiobook. This is a trick that Katherine Milkman, a professor who studies habits at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, calls “temptation bundling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;For Day 3, we’re asking you to spend at least 20 minutes exercising for your brain. Go for a walk with your accountability partner if they’re nearby. (If not, call them and do a walk-and-talk.) Or let us find you a new workout to try, using the tool below. As usual, we can all meet in the comments to catch up and check in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests regular exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/walking-daily-linked-to-lower-risk-of-13-cancers-major-study-finds"&gt;help tackle cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and a new study finds that cancer-fighting biological changes can be triggered in the body after just 10 minutes of intense cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This burst of activity is enough to release beneficial molecules into the blood, the international team of researchers behind the study has found. These molecules speed up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-holy-grail-protein-repairs-dna-and-could-lead-to-a-cancer-vaccine"&gt;DNA repair&lt;/a&gt; and dial down genes related to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187654" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This results in a shift in blood chemistry, triggered by exercise, that potentially slows the growth and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-unexpected-way-that-cancer-cells-spread"&gt;spread of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. This might be something we can harness or exploit to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-cancer-therapy-offers-hope-for-incurable-leukaemia-in-early-trial"&gt;develop new treatments&lt;/a&gt; – in this case, for colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-exercise-reduces-death-from-colon-cancer-by-37-study-finds"&gt;Regular Exercise Reduces Death From Colon Cancer by 37%, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's remarkable is that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells," &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2025/12/exercisehelpsfightbowelcancer/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical exercise physiologist Sam Orange, from Newcastle University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an exciting insight because it opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise, potentially improving cancer treatment and, crucially, patient outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187657" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187657" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/StudyGraphic.jpg" alt="Cancer study graphic" class="wp-image-187657 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/StudyGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/StudyGraphic-600x279.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187657" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Serum from post-exercise blood samples was tested on colon cancer cells, with the researchers finding changes in gene expression and signs of enhanced DNA repair.

After a quick warm-up, they completed an intense cycling exercise on a stationary bike lasting about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using blood serum samples collected before and after the exercise, the researchers identified how the molecular mix changed. These serum samples were then applied to lab-grown &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-cancer-is-rising-rapidly-in-younger-people-and-bacteria-could-be-why"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells, revealing some potential anti-cancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercise has previously been shown to be an effective way to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760"&gt;slow colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; and help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2022-106445"&gt;prevent its return&lt;/a&gt; after surgery, this study provides a detailed look at the biological pathways involved, which in turn opens the door to exploring new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, it's another indication of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;how important exercise is&lt;/a&gt; for our overall health and well-being. Even if you can only fit in a few minutes every day, there's a good chance it'll make a difference &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-boosts-brain-function-across-all-ages-massive-study-confirms"&gt;to your mental&lt;/a&gt; and physical state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even a single workout can make a difference," &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2025/12/exercisehelpsfightbowelcancer/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One bout of exercise, lasting just 10 minutes, sends powerful signals to the body. It's a reminder that every step, every session, counts when it comes to doing your best to protect your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations here: The effects of the blood serum were tested only in lab-grown cancer cells, not people, and only the short-term effects of a single bout of exercise were measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are enough encouraging signs here to suggest that short but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/short-bursts-of-activity-lower-your-risk-of-early-death-study-finds"&gt;vigorous bouts of exercise&lt;/a&gt; – or drugs that somehow stimulate the same effects in the body – could be a promising new way of slowing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US alone, there are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;more than 100,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of colon cancer every year, and more than 50,000 deaths. Colorectal cancer, which includes colon and rectal cancers, is actually the &lt;a href="https://nccrt.org/our-impact/data-and-progress/"&gt;second most common&lt;/a&gt; cause of cancer death in the US right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy," &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2025/12/exercisehelpsfightbowelcancer/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70271"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qf2cu001w336pyoinz70f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the Trump administration announced sweeping changes to the US childhood vaccine schedule this week, parents and pediatricians are trying to make sense of what’s driving the change and how it will affect families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1s7tia000l3b6s3qb9a89b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what’s known so far:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a0003336pzvbkkzsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services is changing the childhood vaccine schedule — a set of recommendations from the federal government about what immunizations children should get and when &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; to scale back the number of vaccines broadly recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1s9095000n3b6sra7jgf52@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are recommendations, not mandates, but the schedule is typically used to guide which vaccines states require for day care or public school, as well as which vaccines are covered by insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1s9hja000p3b6s61rugnyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new schedule recommends that healthy children get 11 vaccines — fewer than were previously recommended broadly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk2w54qr00003b6t1kat69eu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, chickenpox, HPV and others continue to be broadly recommended. But there are narrower recommendations for vaccination against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk2wd9tq00043b6tu9oykuai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They recommend that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider first.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000e336pcyfjhjx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS says insurers will still have to cover all vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of December 31, 2025, without cost-sharing. Parents may incur additional costs if they have to speak to a health care provider first.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk305m52000d3b6thro4muv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine schedule is a set of recommendations from federal officials. It doesn’t make kids get certain shots, nor does it forbid them from getting others. So parents should technically be able to get their children vaccinated according to the previous schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk354ll40004336q3pard6fu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say it’s especially important now to have a good conversation with the child’s pediatrician about what shots they suggest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35x1ot00013b6te3kf9v3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians. But for now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Association of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk34xr4n0002336q3ofefe78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP says it will continue to publish its own &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule&lt;/a&gt;, which is much broader than the government’s shortened list. It includes a yearly flu shot and updated Covid-19 vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30cdu700143b6t41ep319m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary, who’s also a pediatrician in Colorado, thinks things shouldn’t change too much here. Most pediatricians will continue to follow the broader AAP schedule, he says, but adding so many vaccines to the “shared decision-making” category has created some confusion among clinicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35id430008336qhh2qaknp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some medical practices may take additional steps such as having parents sign documents that say they acknowledge the shots are now in a different category. It may also be a little harder to find some of those vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35f6mj0006336qs1srqglj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In previous years, when a handful of shots fell into the “shared decision-making” category, medical offices didn’t always keep those in stock, O’Leary said. “But this move by the government is unprecedented, so it’s hard to predict what will happen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35pxl5000a336qkjyq8ool@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When there are tiers of recommendations, “it suggests that some vaccines are more important than others,” he said. “So I wouldn’t be surprised if this decreases access to some vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000g336pagn2kdat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new schedule wasn’t driven by any new evidence on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In December, President Donald Trump ordered HHS to review the schedule along with those of other developed nations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000h336pp8w0xs56@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS says that reducing the number of vaccines for children gives parents more “flexibility and choice, with less coercion.” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been an outspoken vaccine skeptic for years, also said the change to the schedule “protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000k336po7onnuqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS leaders said they spoke with officials in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;several other wealthy countries, including Germany, Denmark and Japan, in addition to experts at the CDC, and found that the US recommends several more vaccines than some other nations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1ygjp1001n3b6s1p765o6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, gave a presentation to the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee about the Danish vaccine schedule last month. Hoeg, a dual citizen of the US and Denmark, noted that with fewer vaccines, there’s less exposure to aluminum, which is used as an ingredient to create a stronger immune response so doctors can give kids fewer doses. Despite broad evidence that using such adjuvants are safe, Kennedy has argued that aluminum in vaccines is linked to allergies and other health problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk2wk7el00073b6tdp2rhpyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Danish vaccine experts said Denmark is a poor blueprint for US vaccine policy because it has a different health care system, including more accessible prenatal and childhood care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30q747001e3b6t9o7eqdzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trump said on Truth Social on Monday that the new schedule is rooted in science “widely agreed upon by Scientists and Experts all over the World,” but many doctors and public health officials immediately spoke out against the change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000n336p7fjfvdv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes the changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, with President Dr. Andrew Racine calling them “dangerous and unnecessary.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000o336pbtaa0yhj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The longstanding, evidence-based approach that has guided the U.S. immunization review and recommendation process remains the best way to keep children healthy and protect against health complications and hospitalizations,” Racine said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000p336plnyyjeb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Today’s decision, which was based on a brief review of other countries’ practices, upends this deliberate scientific process,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1supfc0000336piu8dpg2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, trustee of the American Medical Association said that organization is “deeply concerned” about the changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1ylaci001p3b6swlilx0zv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies,” she said in a statement. “Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision. When longstanding recommendations are altered without a robust, evidence-based process, it undermines public trust and puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1uik0g0006336pq4ij32p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the changes “reckless” and characterized the decision as an “assault on the national vaccine infrastructure that has saved millions of lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1undhf0009336p8axfty49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Upending long-standing vaccine recommendations without transparent public review and engagement with external experts will undermine confidence in vaccines with the likely outcome of decreasing vaccination rates and increasing disease,” President Dr. Ronald Nahass said in a statement. “Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1upe2u000c336pssuu5rkl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is irresponsible to haphazardly change vaccine recommendations without a solid scientific basis and transparent process. The commitment the U.S. has made to protecting children from vaccine-preventable illness and death must remain a top priority,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk3091te000j3b6tszy4vfcf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Mandy Cohen, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the “shift in vaccine recommendations from HHS adds confusion and unnecessary obstacles for families who want their kids protected from serious illness. I am saddened to see our country take a step backwards in its efforts to protect the health of children and families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30bh3z000p3b6t6rln0nl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In years past, changes to the vaccine schedule would happen after the CDC’s committee of independent advisers weighed whether to update the schedule based on the latest scientific evidence and CDC leadership finalized recommendations and schedules.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30c3ux00113b6ti0e67y2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under Kennedy, there have already been changes to recommendations for some vaccines, including Covid-19, hepatitis B and the combination measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30br8q000v3b6t62bsz503@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, Kennedy fired all the members of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with his own picks, many of whom share his vaccine skepticism. He also fired the CDC director, who typically signs off on that agency’s vaccine recommendations. The new committee has said it will continue reassess even long-established vaccine data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30by79000y3b6truxcq2x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Future HHS leaders could always make a decision to change the vaccine schedule back, according to Dorit Reiss, a professor of law and the James Edgar Hervey Chair in Litigation at UC Law San Francisco, who studies laws around vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30j95e00163b6tmwhxj1gk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiss said in an email to CNN that the new changes have “set a precedent that, unless it’s challenged in courts, can be reversed by the next administration.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From Dec. 14-27, Boston saw a 126 percent increase in confirmed flu cases. During the same timeframe, hospitalizations tripled and flu-related emergency department visits increased by 135 percent, Boston public health officials said Tuesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most of the people hospitalized are adults 65 and older. However, hospitalizations among children younger than 5 increased 150 percent in the last two weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are very concerned about the severity of illness that we’ve noted amongst children this season,” said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s commissioner of public health, at a Tuesday news conference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Compared to last year, twice as many children were hospitalized for flu this year, Ojikutu said. This season’s hospitalizations for children younger than 5 have already exceeded last season’s peak hospitalizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In total, 29 &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; have died from the flu this season, according to state data last updated Dec. 31.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Boston Public Health Commission urged parents to get their children older than six months vaccinated as soon as possible. The city also announced it was opening six additional vaccination clinics starting with one from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesday at City Hall. No appointments are needed, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It is safe to vaccinate children as soon as they are eligible,” Ojikutu said. “The flu vaccine is safe, effective, and it saves lives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The vaccination rate among Boston residents is lagging behind the state — a 32.5 percent rate of vaccination in Boston compared to 34 percent statewide, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Vaccination rates for the flu are low, and this is a problem, and it’s something that we’re working on,” Ojikutu said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ojikutu urged families not to listen to misinformation about the safety of vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This year’s vaccine is potentially mismatched with the flu strain that is circulating most widely: a variant of influenza A H3N2, known as “subclade K.” But Ojikutu said the shot can still decrease the severity of illness and risk of hospitalization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ojikutu urged parents to watch for symptoms such as trouble breathing, persistent fever lasting for several days, extreme weakness or tiredness, confusion, or decreased urination. If they observe those symptoms, she advised parents bring their child into the emergency department for medical attention. Children 2 and younger, and those with underlying illnesses like asthma, lung disease, or obesity, are at a higher risk of complications from the flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Usually the flu presents as a mild illness in children,” Ojikutu said. “However, it can be very dangerous and severe as it was in these two cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As of Dec. 27, nine pediatric flu-related deaths have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention across the country. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; there have been at least 5,000 deaths from flu this season nationwide, as well as at least 11,000,000 illness and 120,000 hospitalizations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last season, there were 470 flu-related deaths in Massachusetts, up from 251 during the 2023-2024 season, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/archived-influenza-dashboard-data-2024-2025/download" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/doc/archived-influenza-dashboard-data-2024-2025/download"&gt;DPH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In addition to getting vaccinated, avoiding congregated areas when sick and masking can help prevent the spread of flu, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Individuals at higher risk of complications, including people 2 and younger, and 65 and older, pregnant people, immunocompromised individuals and people with chronic illnesses should seek medical care if they develop flu-like symptoms or are exposed to a person with flu. Certain antiviral treatments can be prescribed to help prevent severe illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On Monday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services dropped the number of vaccines it recommends for every child from 17 to 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There is no new data that was presented that led to the changes that that the federal administration and HHS made, or any of the decisions that they’ve made,” Ojikutu said. “This is political. It doesn’t feel responsible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ojikutu said parents should instead turn to organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the Boston Public Health Commission for guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;p&gt;The human brain is a greedy organ. It gulps energy, demands constant upkeep, and somehow grew far larger (relative to body size) than the brains of any other primate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have always wondered how evolution paid that bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study from Northwestern University suggests part of the answer may be alive inside us. Our gut microbes, it turns out, don’t just help digest food. They may actively shape how brains develop and function across primate species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By transplanting gut microbes from different primates into mice, researchers found that microbes alone could push mouse brains toward activity patterns seen in humans, squirrel monkeys, or macaques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, bacteria can make a mouse brain behave — at the genetic level — like the brain of a primate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-brain-s-hidden-energy-partner"&gt;The Brain’s Hidden Energy Partner&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans have the largest brain-to-body ratio of any primate. That comes as a cost since brains are expensive tissue from an energy standpoint. They burn a lot of calories nonstop, even at rest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For perspective, the human brain, despite being only 2% of body weight, consumes about 20% of the body’s total energy, roughly 400-500 calories (or 1700-2100 kJ) per day&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary biologists have long debated how our ancestors afforded this upgrade. Ideas ranged from cooking food to eating more meat to shrinking other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, microbes enter the story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that microbes are acting on traits that are relevant to our understanding of evolution, and particularly the evolution of human brains,” said Katie Amato, associate professor of biological anthropology at Northwestern University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amato’s lab has spent years studying how gut microbes differ across primates. &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1066422"&gt;Earlier work&lt;/a&gt; showed that microbes from larger-brained primates produce more metabolic energy when placed in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That finding hinted at a link. But it didn’t answer the bigger question: do microbes actually change how brains work?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study tackled that question head-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-mice-into-microbial-testbeds"&gt;Turning Mice Into Microbial Testbeds&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To isolate cause from coincidence, the researchers designed a tightly controlled experiment. They started with mice that had no gut microbes at all. Then they introduced gut bacteria from three primate species:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Squirrel monkeys (large-brained relative to body size)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Macaques (smaller-brained relative to body size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice lived with these microbes for eight weeks. Nothing else was changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, the team examined the mice’s brains. The differences were quite striking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice that received microbes from large-brain primates showed patterns of brain activity unlike those seen in mice given macaque microbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The microbes didn’t just affect digestion or immunity, both well established functions. They altered the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-that-power-learning-and-flexibility"&gt;Genes That Power Learning and Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers looked closely at brain tissue, they found that microbes from large-brain primates boosted activity in genes tied to energy production and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity allows brains to learn, adapt, and rewire. It’s foundational to memory, problem-solving, and complex behavior. Those same pathways stayed quieter in mice colonized with microbes from smaller-brained primates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then came the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What was super interesting is we were able to compare data we had from the brains of the host mice with data from actual macaque and human brains, and to our surprise, many of the patterns we saw in brain gene expression of the mice were the same patterns seen in the actual primates themselves,” Amato said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In other words, we were able to make the brains of mice look like the brains of the actual primates the microbes came from.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have talked for years about the gut-brain axis — a two-way communication system linking digestion, immunity, mood, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of that signaling travels along the vagus nerve, a thick cable connecting the gut to the brain. Some signals travel through immune molecules called cytokines. And some involve neurotransmitters that bacteria can influence — or even produce themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until now, much of this work relied on correlations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with certain gut microbes showed different moods, behaviors, or risks for neurological conditions. But correlation leaves room for doubt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study offers some much-needed clarity. It shows that microbes alone can drive changes in brain gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One result startled the researchers. Mice that received microbes from smaller-brained primates showed gene expression patterns linked to ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean macaque microbes “cause” these conditions. But the signal suspiciously matches &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9964594/"&gt;earlier human studies&lt;/a&gt; that found altered microbiomes in people with neurodevelopmental differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study provides more evidence that microbes may causally contribute to these disorders — specifically, the gut microbiome is shaping brain function during development,” Amato said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She went further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Based on our findings, we can speculate that if the human brain is exposed to the actions of the ‘wrong’ microbes, its development will change, and we will see symptoms of these disorders, i.e., if you don’t get exposed to the ‘right’ human microbes in early life, your brain will work differently, and this may lead to symptoms of these conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That idea pushes the gut-brain story into uncomfortable territory. It suggests that brain development may depend, in part, on microbial timing and composition early in life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolution-written-in-bacteria"&gt;Evolution Written in Bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary perspective, the findings are provocative. They suggest that natural selection didn’t just shape primate brains directly. It may have shaped microbial communities that support those brains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large brains need energy. Microbes help extract it. Large brains need plasticity? No problem, microbes appear to tune the genes that enable it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amato sees this as a new way to study both evolution and development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting to think about brain development in species and individuals and investigating whether we can look at cross-sectional, cross-species differences in patterns and discover rules for the way microbes are interacting with the brain, and whether the rules can be translated into development as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work also reframes a familiar question. Instead of asking only how brains evolved, scientists may need to ask how ecosystems — inside bodies — co-evolved with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new findings were reported in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426232122"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three Brazilian supercentenarians survived COVID-19 in 2020 before vaccines existed, showing remarkably strong antibody responses that suggest exceptional immune resilience even at ages 110+&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Brazil hosts three of the world’s 10 oldest living men, and its genetically diverse population harbors over 8 million undescribed genomic variants, including rare protective genes invisible in more homogeneous populations&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supercentenarians deploy unusual “killer” CD4+ T cells virtually absent in younger people, while maintaining cellular cleanup systems (proteasomes and autophagy) comparable to much younger individuals&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One Brazilian family includes a 109-year-old woman with three nieces aged 100, 104, and 106, reinforcing evidence that siblings of centenarians are 5-17 times more likely to reach extreme old age themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there is a fountain of youth out there (or at least longevity), it’s probably somewhere in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three Brazilian supercentenarians survived COVID-19 in 2020 before vaccination was available. Sister Inah, a Brazilian nun who passed away in April 2025, had lived to age 116 and was recognized as the oldest person in the world. One Brazilian family boasts a 109-year-old matriarch with three nieces aged 100, 104, and 106. Scientists studying Brazil’s supercentenarians (people who reach 110 or older) continue to find patterns that provide highly valuable insight into aging and disease resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brazil ranks among the top countries for male supercentenarians, with three of the world’s 10 oldest validated men. The nation also surpasses larger, wealthier countries like the United States in female supercentenarians among the 15 longest-lived women globally. Many lived in underserved regions with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fracking-higher-heart-attack-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limited healthcare access&lt;/a&gt;, offering researchers a window into biological resilience independent of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on genetically homogeneous populations from European and East Asian groups. Brazil’s population developed differently. Portuguese colonization began in 1500, followed by approximately 4 million enslaved Africans between the 17th and 19th centuries, then waves of European immigrants and the largest Japanese diaspora outside Japan. A recent study identified more than 8 million undescribed genomic variants in Brazilians, with over 36,000 putatively deleterious (possibly harmful). This diversity means Brazilian supercentenarians may harbor protective variants invisible in other populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brazil-s-supercentenarian-study-design"&gt;Brazil’s Supercentenarian Study Design&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/genpsych/aop/article-10.61373-gp026v.0009/article-10.61373-gp026v.0009.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, study authors at the University of São Paulo’s Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center assembled a nationwide cohort of over 100 centenarians, including 20 supercentenarians. Participants came from multiple Brazilian regions with varied social, cultural, and environmental backgrounds. The team collected clinical data and biological samples for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/134-new-genes-linked-to-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole-genome sequencing&lt;/a&gt; and derived cellular lineages for functional assays and multi-omics analyses (studies examining multiple biological systems simultaneously).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/maria-branyas-morera-lived-to-117-worlds-oldest-womans-secret-yogurt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;supercentenarians&lt;/a&gt; who survived COVID-19 in 2020 before vaccination was available showed strong antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2, along with plasma proteins and metabolites related to innate immune response. At the time of contact with researchers, some participants remained lucid and independent in daily activities like self-feeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cohort includes exceptional familial cases. One 109-year-old woman’s nieces are 100, 104, and 106 years old. This familial clustering aligns with evidence that siblings of centenarians are 5 to 17 times more likely to reach centenarian status themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-systems-adapted-for-longevity"&gt;Immune Systems Adapted for Longevity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As people age, their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/immune-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune systems&lt;/a&gt; slow down and become less effective. But supercentenarians are different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their immune cells retain the same cleanup ability as those of people decades younger. Specifically, they’re excellent at breaking down damaged proteins, the cellular equivalent of taking out the trash before it piles up and causes problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists looking at individual cells found something unusual. Supercentenarians have a special type of immune cell (called CD4+ T cells) that acts like an attack cell. Normally, CD4+ cells are more like coordinators that tell other cells what to do. But in people over 110, many of these coordinator cells have transformed into fighters that can directly kill infected or damaged cells. This fighting version of CD4+ cells barely exists in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supercentenarians also have more natural killer cells, the body’s first responders that patrol for threats. This combination likely helps them fight off &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/did-chronic-ear-infections-cause-extinction-of-neanderthals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic infections&lt;/a&gt; that would wear down most people’s immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists studied one person who lived to 112 (designated M116 in research papers) and found rare variations in genes that control the immune system. These variations affect how the body identifies threats and maintains healthy immune cells over time. People with these particular genetic variations tend to have fewer inflammatory and autoimmune problems as they age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Genetic Maintenance System&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond immune genes, the M116 genome revealed rare variations in genes that act like the body’s maintenance crew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some genes help with autophagy, essentially, our cells’ recycling program. When proteins get damaged or misfolded, autophagy breaks them down and reuses the parts. It’s like having an excellent recycling system instead of letting garbage pile up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other rare gene variants help &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mitochondria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; work efficiently. Mitochondria are your cells’ power plants, converting food into energy. Keeping these running well means cells don’t run out of fuel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional variants affect how genes get turned on and off (gene regulation), and how cells repair damaged DNA. Together, these create a maintenance system that keeps cells running smoothly for much longer than average.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In older Brazilians, researchers found over 2,000 genetic elements, 5 million DNA letters, and 140 immune system variations that don’t appear in global genetic databases. These aren’t mistakes, they’re unique adaptations that may help explain why some Brazilians reach extreme &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/positivity-old-age-warning-sign-not-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;old age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The big picture? &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/centenarians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Supercentenarians&lt;/a&gt; don’t just live longer by luck. Their bodies resist the typical &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging process&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of developing heart disease, cancer, or dementia at normal ages, they delay or avoid these conditions through a combination of protective genes and environmental factors. Understanding how their maintenance systems work could help researchers develop strategies to help more people age healthily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many claims of extreme longevity in Brazil still lack official documentation. International organizations such as LongeviQuest and the Gerontology Research Group validate cases through birth, baptism, marriage, offspring ages, and other civil records.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For millions of people, weight-loss injections such as Wegovy and Mounjaro have felt like a breakthrough that finally makes eating less feel easier. In a few short years, these so-called GLP-1 drugs have reshaped how obesity is treated and how people think about appetite and willpower. But their success raises an awkward question that more people are now facing: what happens when you stop taking them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People come off GLP-1 drugs for many reasons – cost, side-effects or because they have reached a weight they are happy with. Growing numbers are looking for ways to ease off these injections or replace some of their effects with food. One surprisingly simple option worth considering – whether you are still using GLP-1 drugs, tapering them down or stopping altogether – is the humble egg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central problem with almost all weight-loss methods is weight regain. After weight loss, the body pushes back, increasing hunger and nudging metabolism in ways that encourage weight to return, driven by a powerful &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dieting-may-slow-metabolism-but-it-doesnt-ruin-it-154620"&gt;physiological and metabolic drive&lt;/a&gt;. Long-term &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 drugs &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2812936"&gt;show that&lt;/a&gt; once people stop taking them, they regain more than half of the weight they lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rebound may be even stronger than other dieting methods because of how GLP-1 drugs interact with appetite hormones. Evidence suggests that the body’s own release of the satiety hormone GLP-1 after meals &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14242"&gt;may be reduced&lt;/a&gt;, either because GLP-1 is broken down more quickly or because the body becomes less sensitive to it. Hunger then returns faster, making weight maintenance feel like an uphill struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Eggit strategy for life after Wegovy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where eggs might help. They are &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/3/684"&gt;naturally nutritious&lt;/a&gt;, providing high-quality protein that contains all essential amino acids, along with vitamin D and a wide range of micronutrients. They are also the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nbu.12632"&gt;most sustainable form of animal protein&lt;/a&gt; and among the most affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historic concerns about eggs and health have steadily faded as the evidence has become clearer. Earlier &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/eggs-good-or-bad/48F64CD2DD8FE97F78922E2FD0C60C2D"&gt;health scaremongering around eggs&lt;/a&gt; has now &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/12/2657"&gt;been much diminished&lt;/a&gt;. In the UK, egg consumption is rising, with around 37 million eggs eaten each day – roughly three to four per person per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Thirty-seven million eggs are eaten each day in the UK.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/inside-egg-industry-modern-automation-mass-2610496899?trackingId=5ed838c0-f004-4878-a2d0-35396dd3b05c"&gt;Remberto Nieves/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason eggs matter here is their effect on appetite. Eating eggs has been repeatedly shown to help people &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/15/5583"&gt;feel fuller for longer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-012-0444-z"&gt;eat less at later meals&lt;/a&gt;, including among people who are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16373948/"&gt;overweight or obese&lt;/a&gt;. This is partly because protein in eggs triggers the release of the body’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524000054?via%3Dihub"&gt;own GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;, while also suppressing the hunger hormone &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20226994/"&gt;ghrelin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, eggs act as a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12986-016-0153-3"&gt;natural GLP-1 agonist&lt;/a&gt; rather than a drug. The effect is amplified when eggs are combined with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27306734"&gt;fibre-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as wholegrain toast, which further boosts GLP-1 release and brings &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-023-00891-z"&gt;additional health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. This makes eggs a useful surrogate for some of the appetite-controlling effects of injections, particularly for people reducing their dose or stopping altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eggs also have a role for people who are still taking GLP-1 drugs. Losing weight does not just mean losing fat; muscle is often lost too, particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12444289/"&gt;when taking GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;. Preserving muscle requires adequate protein intake, yet this can be difficult when appetite is suppressed and food intake is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that protein intakes of around 1g per kilogram of body weight or higher are associated with greater preservation of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523292795?via%3Dihub"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Eggs offer a practical, portion-controlled way to reach these targets when larger meals are unappealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond protein, eggs provide nutrients that many people struggle to get enough of. The UK population is generally at risk of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fortifying-food-and-drink-with-vitamin-d-a-sacn-rapid-review/fortifying-foods-and-drinks-with-vitamin-d-main-report"&gt;low vitamin D intake&lt;/a&gt;, particularly during winter. And a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1566498/full"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that people taking GLP-1 drugs were falling short on several key nutrients, including calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium and vitamins A, C, D, E and K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters because people with obesity may already have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32743907/"&gt;deficiencies&lt;/a&gt; in nutrients such as vitamin E, selenium and zinc. Eggs may be a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2406"&gt;cost-effective&lt;/a&gt; way of addressing nutritional shortfalls, particularly for those using GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this may be a good moment to rediscover the virtues of an everyday food. Eggs are not nature’s Wegovy or Mounjaro, and it would be misleading to frame them that way. But their effects on appetite, protein intake and nutrition should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are considering GLP-1 drugs, currently using them or planning your exit strategy, eggs may turn out to be a quiet ally. As more people come off these powerful medications, simple foods like this could play an important role in what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This area contains a lot of blood vessels – little capillaries that keep the nostrils well supplied with blood, to warm the air you inhale. These can break open, creating a bleed that mostly pours from the nostril, though some blood may trickle into the mouth or throat, especially if you lean your head back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="38f6c6ba-dc34-4082-a870-9e78838a62af" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Let them’, creatine and fibermaxxing: the biggest wellness trends of 2025","elementId":"38f6c6ba-dc34-4082-a870-9e78838a62af","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/31/creatine-fibermaxxing-biggest-wellness-trends"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Posterior nosebleeds are rarer and bigger. These are triggered when larger blood vessels deeper in the nasal passage burst. If there is significantly more blood flowing down the back of your throat, potentially causing you to choke, that’s a posterior nosebleed, explains Dr Amin Javer, an ENT surgeon and research director at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Posterior nosebleeds are more serious than anterior ones, and require prompt medical attention. They’re most often seen in older adults, especially those taking anticoagulants, which increase the risk of hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-should-you-do-when-your-nose-is-bleeding" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do when your nose is bleeding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When a nosebleed starts, many people instinctively tip their head back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s the worst thing you could do,” says Javer. “You’re going to just start drinking the blood.” Blood in the stomach causes nausea, so it’s best to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, you should put your head forward and very gently pinch your nose, he says. A cold compress on the neck or nose can help constrict blood vessels and slow the bleed, as can a spritz of a nasal decongestant like oxymetazoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you see thick clots come out of your nose, it can be unsettling. But it’s not necessarily a bad sign, nor is it uncommon. “It’s actually just showing that your blood is clotting effectively,” says Dr Peter Manes, an ENT surgeon and residency director at Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If your nosebleeds are occurring multiple times a week, interfering with your daily life, and/or lasting longer than &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-nosebleeds/basics/art-20056683" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, they warrant seeing a doctor for a clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-causes-nosebleeds" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes nosebleeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of the most common reasons for [anterior] nosebleeds is when the area dries out,” explains Loftus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dry air is especially to blame in winter. “It doesn’t matter how much rain there is outside – our heaters turn on, the humidity in our bedrooms goes down,” says Javer. He recommends cracking a window while you sleep or getting a humidifier to keep humidity levels between 40% and 50%. You can also moisturize your nasal lining with saline spray or a very thin layer of Vaseline just inside the nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Another common reason for nosebleeds is “digital manipulation, which is a nice way of saying nose picking or scratching your nose”, says Loftus. The nose is delicate, and even a light bump or scratch can pop a capillary and cause bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Ginseng, garlic, ginkgo – some of those herbal medications can thin your blood&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inflammation from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/13/how-to-treat-manage-seasonal-allergies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;allergies&lt;/a&gt; or viral infections can make the lining more fragile and prone to cracking. Physical exertion sometimes plays a role too. Exercises, especially those that combine effort with positions where your head dips below your heart, like downward dog pose, can increase pressure in the face and prompt a bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Medications and supplements add another layer of risk. Prescription blood thinners and aspirin make bleeding more likely, and some herbal supplements have similar effects. “Ginseng, garlic, ginkgo – some of those herbal medications can thin your blood,” says Manes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":22,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com","hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers":true}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-am-i-having-frequent-nosebleeds" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why am I having frequent nosebleeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’re having a nosebleed every day and you don’t know what’s causing it, you need evaluation,” says Loftus. “Even if it’s not bothering you that much, that’s alarming enough to come see a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Manes agrees that nosebleeds can become “normalized”, and easy to dismiss as minor, but they do occasionally signal more serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abundant nosebleeds can indicate that your blood is not clotting correctly, Loftus says. A doctor may ask about alcohol use or other factors to discern if a liver issue is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hormonal changes in pregnancy can play a role. Loftus says pregnancy-induced surges in hormones like estrogen and progesterone are linked to a higher likelihood of lobular capillary hemangioma, a “usually pretty small lesion in the nose” that can cause nosebleeds. These growths are not inherently dangerous, but should be evaluated by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re in your 20s and suddenly having frequent, heavy nosebleeds, you could be among the roughly one in 5,000 people with “hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia” (HHT), a genetic vascular abnormality that often presents in young adulthood and requires treatment. Without medical attention, patients with HHT may “succumb to death from nosebleed,” says Javer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"8123c371-b43f-4f74-b9b7-7faefc0f5289","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="8123c371-b43f-4f74-b9b7-7faefc0f5289" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Frequent unilateral nosebleeds – bleeding from only one nostril – are a significant red flag for doctors. That pattern can signal a tumor or polyp, especially if accompanied by symptoms on the same side of the face, like not being able to breathe through the nose; facial pain or pressure; or unilateral ear pain, numbness or vision changes, says Loftus. “That should get checked out,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-doctors-treat-a-nosebleed" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do doctors treat a nosebleed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many nosebleeds can be taken care of at home. But if you have persistent, frequent or high-volume nosebleeds that disrupt your daily life, or if you think you’re having a posterior bleed, seek medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you arrive in the emergency room or a doctor’s office with an active nosebleed, there are a few things you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;First is “a thorough examination of your nasal cavity, trying to identify a source of the bleed,” says Manes. Most bleeds can be controlled with packing – the insertion of a nasal tampon (which is different to the menstrual product).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A doctor may cauterize the area that is bleeding, says Manes. The procedure stings, but a numbing cream can ease the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You may have your vitals checked and blood drawn to look for issues such as anemia or clotting abnormalities. If symptoms suggest a mass in the sinuses, a CT scan or MRI may be recommended. And if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood, you could require a transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFA0N2xKdE9XSkhSS3B5RGdKMVgzVDB2MUFhLVJpREFDM2lFclBJZmdOMWtjcC02ZXotVFVEQ0JxVTJOZnBNRFVrTW9sLXRVTXNPUU9lT2NlNTRlaW5FWkY3WXRqampHbGJZREFaZEF1TzE0TllobTdDRlIwVGg</guid></item><item><title>富兰克林县的后院羊群禽流感检测呈阳性- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/news/local/avian-flu-franklin-county-january-2026/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The state reports a case of bird flu has been discovered in Franklin County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Consumer Services said a 'backyard flock' tested positive for High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a release distributed on Tuesday. The strain of virus is considered low-risk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The virus is considered highly contagious to other birds.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A backyard flock generally refers to animals not intended for commercial use.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The development is the first confirmed positive case in Franklin County and the ninth confirmed positive case in North Carolina since Oct. 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“HPAI has been found in wild birds throughout the state so
reports of positive backyard flocks will likely happen on occasion,” said state veterinarian Dr.
Mike Martin. “I encourage our commercial and backyard flock
owners to continue to follow strict biosecurity measures and if your flock is
experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away
to your local veterinarian or to the NCDA&amp;amp;CS’ Veterinary Division at
919-707-3250.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A list of domestic bird cases of HPAI is &lt;a href="https://www.ncagr.gov/divisions/veterinary/AvianInfluenza"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Flu cases are continuing to spike in the United States. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that at least 5,000 people have died of the illness this year and that doctor's visits for flu have reached their highest level in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimated there have been at least 11 million flu cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;as of December 27&lt;/a&gt;, as well as at least 120,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. There have been nine flu-related pediatric deaths, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, 8.2% of outpatient doctor's visits nationwide were for flu-like illnesses, the CDC said. That's the highest level recorded since 1997, &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight jurisdictions are showing "high" or "very high" levels of flu, the agency said. Last week, 32 jurisdictions met that description. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only four jurisdictions had low or minimal flu levels. Nevada has "insufficient data," the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A new subtype of influenza A called H3N2 is spreading quickly and fueling this year's cases, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-season-2025-experts-pretty-worried/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;experts told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The CDC reported that of the 994 influenza viruses that tested positive for flu between Dec. 20 and Dec. 27, 971 of them had influenza A. When 600 of those specimens were subtyped, 91.2% of them were found to be H3N2. The strain is known to cause tough flu seasons, especially for seniors, and is harder for the immune system to recognize. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, fewer people have received the flu vaccine. The CDC estimated that about 130 million doses of the flu vaccine had been given this year. On Monday, the CDC announced updates to its &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-announces-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recommended childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The changes included saying that children who are not high-risk should engage in "shared clinical decision-making" with their doctor about whether to get the flu vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics called the changes "dangerous" and said they would continue to share their own recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face," said Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;As flu cases surge in Arlington, health leaders are encouraging residents to get vaccinated and practice healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalizations for the flu surged by more than 50% in Arlington during the last week of 2025, according to Arlington Public Health. About 14% of all patients visiting emergency departments and urgent care clinics were diagnosed with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While last year was one of the worst flu seasons we had seen in many years, this year may surpass it,” Taryn Overman, VHC Health’s associate chief nursing officer, told ARLnow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for the flu are trending up &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/respiratory-diseases-in-virginia/data/#Weekly-Summary"&gt;across Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, making up 9.8% of all visits as of the last week of December. Meanwhile, almost a quarter of all emergency visits statewide — 24.3% — were for respiratory illnesses, a 6.1-point increase from the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By age group, the largest proportion of patients were from 0-4 years old and 5-17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arlington Public Health offered the following advice to help prevent the spread of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get vaccinated:&lt;/b&gt; It’s not too late to get your flu shot. Arlington Public Health strongly recommends flu vaccination to reduce illness and hospitalization. COVID-19 vaccination is also advised, and both vaccines can be given at the same time. Vaccines are widely available through primary care providers and local pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens. To find a location, visit &lt;a href="http://vaccinefinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://vaccinefinder.org&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1767733207566000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3ENXxveCSPmr_hX5MJXPRo"&gt;vaccinefinder.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practice good hygiene:&lt;/b&gt; Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer to kill germs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay home if you’re sick:&lt;/b&gt; This helps prevent spreading illness to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider wearing a mask:&lt;/b&gt; Masks provide an added layer of protection against respiratory viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Overman advised members of the public to support a healthy immune system by staying hydrated, getting plenty of sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and managing stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is recommended that you stay home until you are fever-free for at least 24 hours,” she said. “If you must be around others, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last full week of 2025, seven Arlington residents visited emergency rooms for Covid and 12 were hospitalized for RSV, according to the county’s &lt;a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Health/Respiratory-Illness/Data"&gt;respiratory illness dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/respiratory-diseases-in-virginia/data/vaccines/"&gt;About 17.3%&lt;/a&gt; of Arlington’s population has received the 2025-26 Covid vaccine, significantly above the statewide average of 9.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, Covid-19 and RSV cases are relatively stable, making up 0.7% and 0.6% of all emergency department visits, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

Nutrition fuels the process with adequate protein, carbs, and healthy fats that ensure optimal muscle development. Rest is where growth happens—neglecting recovery can stall progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;How does walking fit into that process? “When we walk, we engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, which can help improve muscle endurance and strength,” said Cara D’Orazio, C.P.T., group fitness instructor and owner of &lt;a href="https://cgmfit.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://cgmfit.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="C.G.M. Fitness" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;C.G.M. Fitness&lt;/a&gt;. “While walking alone may not be enough to build significant muscle mass, it can certainly contribute to overall muscle development. The key is to incorporate walking into a comprehensive exercise routine that includes strength training and other forms of physical activity.” Kraft said it’s also ideal for injury recovery and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="9" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What muscles are working when you walk?" data-anchor-id="what-muscles-are-working-when-you-walk" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What muscles are working when you walk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Walking activates multiple muscle groups with a primary focus on legs, glutes, and core, Kraft said. Over time, that engagement enriches stability, posture, and overall mobility, he added. The more specific heavy hitter muscles walking engages, according to D’Orazio, are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="11" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="11.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0.0"&gt;Quadriceps: &lt;/strong&gt;These muscles in the front of the thigh help straighten the knee and extend the leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="11.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;Hamstrings: &lt;/strong&gt;The hamstring muscles in the back of the thigh help bend the knee and flex the leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="11.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.2.0"&gt;Glutes:&lt;/strong&gt; The gluteal muscles in the buttocks help extend the hip and stabilize the pelvis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="11.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.3.0"&gt;Calves:&lt;/strong&gt; The calf muscles in the lower leg help flex the foot and stabilize the ankle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="12" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Ways to boost your walks to build muscle" data-anchor-id="ways-to-boost-your-walks-to-build-muscle" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;Ways to boost your walks to build muscle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There are lots of ways to enhance your walks with strength training. It’s all about incorporating resistance and variety. Below, D’Orazio and Joy Puleo, N.P.C.P., A.C.S.M., director of education at &lt;a href="https://www.pilates.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pilates.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Balanced Body" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Balanced Body&lt;/a&gt;, suggest adding one or two of the following variations to each of your walks to increase the challenge for your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="14" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="14.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0.0"&gt;Intervals:&lt;/strong&gt; Vary your speed by walking at a relaxed pace followed by short, faster paced intervals. This will challenge your cardio threshold and increase general cardiovascular health—plus, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565117/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565117/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies show" data-node-id="14.0.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that interval training may also help build muscle mass.

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                
                
                &lt;p&gt;What if the healthiest vegetable on the planet isn't kale, spinach, or &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/broccoli-is-america-s-favorite-vegetable-1847101896/" target="_blank"&gt;broccoli (America's favorite vegetable)&lt;/a&gt;, but something you've probably walked past in the grocery store without a second glance? It's tiny, peppery, and misused and abused as garnish — it's watercress! Most people aren't familiar with watercress — maybe because for some absurd reason grocery stores tend to stock it in obscure places or because it never got the same PR push as kale or cauliflower. Unfortunately, watercress is barely making headlines six years after it topped the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, with a perfect nutrient density score of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many fruits and vegetables are known for their nutrients, the CDC used a stricter standard in the study. To qualify as a "powerhouse" food, an item had to deliver at least 10% of the daily value of 17 key nutrients per 100 calories. The nutrient amounts were pulled from USDA data measured per 100 grams of raw food, then converted into nutrients per calorie to determine the score (now that's some pretty particular criteria!). Those 17 nutrients were chosen for their public health importance: potassium, protein, calcium, iron, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin A, plus nutrients linked to chronic-disease protection, including fiber, folate, zinc, and vitamins B6, B12, C, D, E, and K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although watercress may not have the vitamin A of sweet potatoes, the potassium of beet greens, or the protein of Brussels sprouts, what makes it special is that it still delivers at least 10% of every qualifying nutrient — all while staying vastly below 100 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;

                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Bhofack2/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Watercress is also one of the richest sources of phytochemicals — natural compounds found in plant foods that not only give them their color, but also help protect the body from inflammation and cell damage linked to chronic illnesses, especially cancer. When watercress is cut or chewed, it releases compounds called isothiocyanates, which help neutralize carcinogens and stop tumors from spreading. Studies show the isothiocyanates in watercress may help prevent colon cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some phytochemicals within watercress contain a high amount of antioxidants called carotenoids, which protect cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of a heart attack and stroke. Watercress also contains dietary nitrates — plant compounds known to improve blood flow, support healthy blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and may even enhance athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list of benefits goes on. Next time you're at the grocery store, add watercress to your cart — and if you can't find it, ask a grocer where it's hiding. Watercress is most nutrient-dense when it's raw since many of its vitamins are heat-sensitive, so you'll want to add it as a peppery bite to salads, replace &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1880682/salad-green-iceberg-lettuce-lack-nutrients/" target="_blank"&gt;the classic greens that are lacking in the nutrient department&lt;/a&gt; on cold sandwiches, top on eggs and roasted meats, or blend into pesto, green goddess dressing, or even &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1897648/easy-green-sauce-pasta-blender/" target="_blank"&gt;a quick green pasta sauce&lt;/a&gt;. Your body — and your taste buds — will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

The virus can stay active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. The WHO also notes that one person who is infected with measles may infect up to 18 other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, Dr. Russo explains.

It’s part of the childhood vaccination series and is given in two doses. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses is 97% effective, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s still possible to get the MMR vaccine as an adult or beyond that age range, but the doses need to be spread out by 28 days, per the AAP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, which means that it contains a weakened form of the measles virus, explains &lt;a href="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=jsellick" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=jsellick" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Sellick, D.O." data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;John Sellick, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

While there is no treatment for measles, you can get vaccinated after an exposure or receive an injection of antibodies called immune serum globulin to help provide protection against severe disease, Dr. Adalja says. (The immune serum globulin treatment is the only option for pregnant women, infants, and people who are immunocompromised because the vaccine is a live virus and not recommended for those groups, Dr. Russo explains.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But if you know you’ve been exposed and you’re not sure if you have immunity, “the safest thing is to get vaccinated,” Dr. Russo says. Dr. Sellick agrees. “It’s safe to get another dose, even if you were fully vaccinated or already immune to the virus,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-get-measles" data-node-id="26" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;What to do if you get measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you develop symptoms of measles, call your doctor (don’t go into the office—you’ll risk exposing others). Again, there is no treatment for measles, but your doctor may suggest immune serum globulin and supportive care, like acetaminophen for fever and plenty of fluids, along with monitoring yourself for serious complications of the virus. Ultimately, it’s best to contact a healthcare provider.

From there, people breathe in infectious particles or touch surfaces that those particles land on and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, which may lead to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The infectious period with measles is long—people who are infected may spread the virus to others four days before they develop the classic measles rash and four days after it appears, per the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I prevent getting measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is a vaccine to prevent measles, called the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It’s part of the childhood vaccination series and is given in two doses. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses is 97% effective, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. (Despite new changes to the CDC's childhood vaccination schedule, the MMR vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-acts-presidential-memorandum-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:still recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;still recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all children.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The first dose is usually given between 12 and 15 months, and the second dose is given between ages four and six, or whenever children start school, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/measles/measles-vaccine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Academy of Pediatrics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP). It’s still possible to get the MMR vaccine as an adult or beyond that age range, but the doses need to be spread out by 28 days, per the AAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, which means that it contains a weakened form of the measles virus, explains &lt;a href="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=jsellick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:John Sellick, D.O.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;John Sellick, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo. That trains the immune system to react if you’re exposed to measles down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The vaccine is not perfect, but it’s really pretty good,” Dr. Russo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Just be aware that people born between 1963 and 1967 received a measles vaccine during childhood that isn’t considered effective, according to the CDC. If this describes you, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting vaccinated again.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, you &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64016549/can-you-get-measles-if-you-are-vaccinated/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:can get measles if you’re fully vaccinated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;can get measles if you’re fully vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unlikely. (Again, the vaccine is 97% effective, so &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:three out of 100 vaccinated people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;three out of 100 vaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; may get it.) “There were a few individuals who received a shot in the most recent measles outbreak and got infected,” Dr. Russo says. “But if you have some protection, you’re less likely to get severe disease as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you’ve been exposed to measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you discover that you crossed paths with someone who has measles, don’t panic. If you were born before 1957, doctors consider you to have “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:presumptive immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;presumptive immunity&lt;/a&gt;,” which means that you were likely exposed to the virus as a child and therefore should have immunity to it, Dr. Russo says. “If you have presumptive immunity or if you’ve been vaccinated, you don’t have to worry about a measles exposure,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amesh A. Adalja, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Amesh A. Adalja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. “There is no action to take,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you were born after 1957 and you haven’t been vaccinated or are partially vaccinated, you still have options. While there is no treatment for measles, you can get vaccinated after an exposure or receive an injection of antibodies called immune serum globulin to help provide protection against severe disease, Dr. Adalja says. (The immune serum globulin treatment is the only option for pregnant women, infants, and people who are immunocompromised because the vaccine is a live virus and not recommended for those groups, Dr. Russo explains.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if you know you’ve been exposed and you’re not sure if you have immunity, “the safest thing is to get vaccinated,” Dr. Russo says. Dr. Sellick agrees. “It’s safe to get another dose, even if you were fully vaccinated or already immune to the virus,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What to do if you get measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you develop symptoms of measles, call your doctor (don’t go into the office—you’ll risk exposing others). Again, there is no treatment for measles, but your doctor may suggest immune serum globulin and supportive care, like acetaminophen for fever and plenty of fluids, along with monitoring yourself for serious complications of the virus. Ultimately, it’s best to contact a healthcare provider. They can provide the next steps from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQZDRkX0k2SVpXRGpRUm1nYmx4aXlYRTE4TjRmRkprSUlXWXg1eTIwdWRUb0x5UnFXMWhQelZsZ0pLVEFBLXBJYmtSRVRyZmdIYWpueHFIc1Bwbll3UTNITWgxb1VmR3h6QmktSGZxb0pkc2xWTWM0a3VNZWFqczFlY0xYbHhDRWg5czF6ZkVmR1RPZ2l0ckZxaWRn</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的塔斯基吉实验- Paul Offit | Substack</title><link>https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/rfk-jrs-tuskegee-experiment</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Paul Offit | Substack</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:03:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBYZ3kwRlItaEpjcTB0MEpxQ2l3M1plcnhxQlpaUDlwSGE0dDlqWW1mRFIzM0NvOWZZbUVpWXdWS3FlVXFjSm0zX2xuV1NHTVRQWXJSbnRzMHhuOVVQdTZuQWQ4OGNqZlE4dEV2QQ</guid></item><item><title>如果您因为走上楼梯而被缠住，这意味着什么- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/winded-walking-up-stairs-normal-health_l_695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ascended a flight or two of stairs, you likely know the feeling of being out of breath once you reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common occurrence among folks of all ages and fitness abilities. But is it something to worry about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts told HuffPost there are a few points to keep in mind when it comes to this phenomenon. While it can be normal, it can also be cause for concern or even a fitness challenge to try and improve. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be perfectly normal — going up stairs is harder on your body than walking on a flat surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs is “what we call a normal physiological response,” said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/katherine-pohlgeers/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Katherine Pohlgeers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/katherine-pohlgeers/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Katherine Pohlgeers&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine and sports medicine doctor at University of Louisville Health. “Because you’ve got this increased demand on your body, you’ve got increased work — you’ve got increased oxygen demand and ventilatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re winded for a minute or so but can easily catch your breath, it’s no cause for concern, said &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/expert/karl-erickson/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Karl Erickson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/expert/karl-erickson/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Karl Erickson&lt;/a&gt;, a performance specialist at Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite normal ... you’re essentially lifting your body. You’re doing a squat or a lunge when you go up the stairs,” said Erickson, “so, definitely more effortful than just walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how winded you are will vary; you’ll be more out of breath if you run up the stairs or walk up with a heavy suitcase than if you leisurely walked up the stairs. Some folks may not even notice the breathlessness as much as others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve got an elite athlete ― like, I doubt Caitlin Clark gets winded going up a flight of stairs ― but for the average middle-aged person, and, unfortunately, especially here in the United States, we tend to live a little bit more sedentary lifestyle, so it can be very normal to get winded just going up one flight of stairs,” Pohlgeers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it’s a new change or you’re noticing prolonged breathlessness, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be perfectly normal to feel winded after climbing the stairs, there are a few red flags that may signal a concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your breathlessness a new issue that’s never happened before? Or is it getting worse? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, you should talk to a doctor about potential underlying issues, according to Pohlgeers. “The biggest thing is for people not to necessarily think, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m dying,’ but also, don’t always just simply dismiss it as, ‘Well, I’m out of shape.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are things that we really take seriously,” Pohlgeers added. “If there is a change in the exercise capacity, just making sure that we as doctors are able to do our due diligence and rule out any underlying conditions, so that we can maximize people’s lifestyles and help them be as healthy as they possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying conditions such as heart failure, obesity, chronic lung disease, being a smoker, COPD and even being &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iron-deficiency-anemia-fatigue-brain-fog_l_68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="anemic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;anemic&lt;/a&gt; can all make the breathlessness you feel after &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/walking" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/walking" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; up stairs worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How long it takes you to recover is always a good indicator, too,” Erickson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for your breathing to be faster for a minute or two after walking up a bunch of stairs, Erickson explained. “But if it’s staying elevated past three minutes or a prolonged period of time, that’s when it becomes more concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice chest pain, headache or vision changes along with the breathlessness, that’s worrisome and worth chatting with your doctor about too, Pohlgeers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you're good. That's a very good sign."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can build your stair-climbing endurance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less winded after climbing the stairs, start doing it more often (as long as you don’t have any underlying conditions that can put your health at risk). If you have issues such as heart failure or COPD that make climbing stairs a challenge, get those treated first, Pohlgeers stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body adapts to imposed demands on it. So, if you’re practicing going up the stairs, you become more efficient,” Erickson said. The muscles needed to climb the stairs will strengthen the more you use them, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll ask patients, actually, that are getting ready to go into surgery, it’s like a pre-op clearance: ‘Could you carry groceries up three to four flights of stairs?’” Pohlgeers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s OK if you’re out of breath by the top of the three or four flights of stairs. The concern is can you physically do it without having symptoms like chest pain, vision changes or a headache, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you’re good. That’s a very good sign,” Pohlgeers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing your base strength levels — doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="lunges" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="squats" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, that’s going to give you more power, more strength to go up [stairs],” Erickson added. Improving your cardiovascular fitness can also help decrease the fatigue you feel at the top of the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working on building up your endurance, do so gradually, Pohlgeers suggested. You don’t need to go up and down the stairs five times in a row. Instead, slowly build up your fitness ability in a sustainable and even enjoyable way, whether that’s by doing more yard work, going on walks with your neighbor or taking up gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on your strength and cardiovascular fitness, your stair-climbing endurance should also improve, according to Erickson. You’ll be easily climbing back-to-back flights of stairs in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQNml0UUNmQmFUTGE3Rm94ZmZabHlETDVjcnB2bExrTlpnZ211RDJ4WmNicmUxd2hoenNSTGZVUF81VHJjZXFVYUJqWnA3NWxHUng3M0RCSEt1NEZld1hNT3BLQnpzLVJuYjFId1pKZXkyYXJRa0xwRXMxbmNMSjNxc1g0X1R0djVBSXp6bHFpdE1nSU9uYXVlLXIzX2fSAaIBQVVfeXFMUEpBdEhqQUw5bXpJcHJpeGVGYmF2WnVQTmh3ejV6VkNoR0xjVGRsQVVNSkFRSWZVcXhpcU5YR1lEVENDbEI2TElKcHl0RmJ3NGJQXzVwN19TdlNSOVlQRnRQQ1FmZXRoYmNqWWRvN0tjQVA1TEZrNHVIbGhxckNDY3Ytb3dVbDFVVkU2MXZpYTNkY0FOanQ3UUFzZTNIb0NVWDJ3</guid></item><item><title>健康专家说，这9种水果和蔬菜是免疫力的发电站-非常简单</title><link>https://www.realsimple.com/best-fruits-and-vegetables-for-immune-support-11879162</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-article-intro_1-0" class="comp mntl-article-intro mntl-block article-content__description"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cold and flu season brings immunity to the top of everyone’s mind—but honestly when &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune health important&lt;/a&gt;? While many turn to dietary supplements to support their immune system (like vitamin C or zinc supplements), all of the immune-boosting nutrients we need can actually be found right in the produce section of the supermarket. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fruits and vegetables are naturally rich in a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immunity-supporting nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that help the body fight off the bacteria and viruses that cause us to get sick. Here are some of the all-time best fruits and vegetables to eat for immunity, based on their powerful nutrients and how to eat them all year long.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-key-nutrients-that-support-immune-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Key Nutrients That Support Immune Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating a well-balanced diet rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables is an important component of supporting immunity,” says &lt;a href="https://www.coletterosenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Colette Micko, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching. This is because fruits and veggies meet many of the nutritional criteria of an immune-boosting food. “An immune-boosting food is one that is both hydrating, and rich in vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals (chemical compounds found in plants),” Micko says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the ultimate hydrator, water supports virtually every body system, including the immune system. This is because &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/how-much-water-to-drink-day" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;one of the many roles it plays in the body&lt;/a&gt; is aiding waste removal and detoxification. This helps to flush away any unwanted pathogens that may lead to illness. Plus, it helps to maintain moist, healthy protective tissues in the skin, eyes, mouth, and nose, all of which are our first line of defense against unwanted microorganisms.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most influential immune modulators in the body is the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-fruits-and-vegetables-for-gut-health-7378020" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;—a community of over a trillion microorganisms living in the large intestine. In fact, the gut microbiome has been tied to the expression of a variety of chronic diseases ranging from type 2 diabetes to heart disease and even eczema—as well as acute illness like flu and cold.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber, especially soluble fiber, acts as a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt;, or food for our healthy gut bacteria in the microbiome, helping to keep the community strong and functional. All fruits and vegetables in their whole, unprocessed form will contain some amount of soluble fiber (although &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/high-fiber-fruits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;these are some of the highest-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; you can eat.)

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many vitamins that support optimal immune health with the top contenders including &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-a-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamins A&lt;/a&gt;, B6, C, D, and E. All of these work to support immunity through their antioxidant properties. Antioxidants not only help reduce systemic inflammation but also target oxidative compounds (hence their name) like free radicals that can make us sick.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Minerals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A handful of minerals also champion the immune system including zinc, iron, and selenium. “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Minerals such as zinc&lt;/a&gt; help to support the growth and normal functioning of our immune cells while selenium boosts white blood cell production,” says Micko. Zinc and selenium also act as antioxidants in the body.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There are specific compounds found in fruits and vegetables called phytonutrients that help reduce the chances of viruses and bacteria multiplying in your body,” Micko says. There are over 10,000 of these bioactive nutrients, also called plant compounds, currently known to scientists—all of which are considered &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563161/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immunomodulators&lt;/a&gt; that reduce inflammation and target free radicals.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Anytime you’re eating plant food, including fruits and vegetables, you’re also consuming a variety of these bioactive compounds. “These phytonutrients are what give fruits and vegetables their color and smell (different colors represent different antioxidants and phytochemicals) which is why ‘eating the rainbow’ is important for optimizing immune health,” Micko adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-top-fruits-and-veggies-for-immune-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Top Fruits and Veggies for Immune Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all fruits and veggies will support immunity through their various water, fiber, and phytonutrient contents, some stand above the rest thanks to their unique combination of immune-boosting nutrients. Here are nine of the best fruits and vegetables for immune health you can eat all year around.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Red bell peppers are a great source of vitamins C and E. Just half a cup of sliced red bell peppers provides more than 100% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin C,” says Micko.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These slightly sweet peppers are also chock-full of water, fiber, and plant compounds. Red bell peppers are the perfect addition to a savory stir fry, refreshing salad, or pasta dish.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-make-broccoli-healthier-8704736" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cruciferous veggie&lt;/a&gt; is an immune-boosting powerhouse in its own right thanks to its soluble fiber and vitamin A, B6, and C content. And thankfully, there are so many tasty ways to use &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/broccoli-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt; in the kitchen from soups and stews to omelets, pasta, and rice dishes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all citrus fruits deserve a mention in a list of immune-supporting foods, grapefruit gets a special shoutout in particular, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/fruits-high-in-vitamin-c-8630435" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hefty amounts of vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;. One grapefruit contains well over 100% of your daily needs, plus soluble fiber, water, and vitamin A.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Grapefruit can of course be enjoyed simply with a spoon (people typically eat about half), but it also adds a fruity, acidic bite to salads, sauces, and a variety of baked goods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@447e2f79" data-item-index="3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-spinach-7152107" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Spinach&lt;/a&gt; is a rich source of antioxidants (specifically vitamins A, C, and E),” says Micko. It is also a source of iron. These nutrients combined with the fiber and plant compounds also found in spinach make it an excellent choice for those looking to bolster their immune system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@1052c6db" data-item-index="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similarly to citrus, all berries are exceptional immune-boosting fruits, but it’s time to spotlight the often overlooked &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-store-blackberries-8654590" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blackberry&lt;/a&gt;. While this dark berry is rich in water, vitamin C, and plant compounds, its fiber content really sets it apart. With a whopping eight grams per cup, blackberries support a thriving gut microbiome, and thus an equally flourishing immune system.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As an excellent source of plant compounds and vitamins C and E, avocado is certainly an &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-to-avoid-getting-sick-8762877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune-booster&lt;/a&gt;. But did you know that avocado is one of the best sources of soluble fiber available? Its prebiotic power bodes well for both our immune systems and gut health. Add this mild and creamy green fruit to salads, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, eggs, spring rolls, and so much more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@31d8be5f" data-item-index="6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason ginger shots have become super trendy in recent years to strengthen immunity. “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/ingredients-guide/ginger" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ginger root contains a variety of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that help reduce inflammation and has natural antimicrobial and antibiotic properties to help ward off infection,” Micko explains.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But you really don’t need to buy ginger shots (or pull out the juicer to make them at home). Instead, cook and bake with fresh ginger to reap all its healthy benefits. This pungent root is a fantastic addition to stir-fries, soups, rice dishes, proteins, and also many sweet treats from sorbet to baked goods to cocktails (and mocktails).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kiwifruit, more commonly known as &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/kiwi-health-benefits-7111218" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kiwi&lt;/a&gt;, is a great addition to your immune health regimen as it’s loaded with fiber, plant compounds, water, and vitamins C and E. This tropical fruit is perfect in smoothies, fruit salads, chia pudding, and even savory marinades.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@28a30b2" data-item-index="8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a potent source of phytonutrients, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/health-benefits-garlic#toc-tasty-recipes-to-try" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; also makes this list of immune-boosting fruits and veggies. But &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you consume your garlic is actually really important to reap the full benefits. “Crushed, chewed, or finely chopped garlic releases a chemical component called allicin that increases white blood cell production, making your immune system better equipped to fight infection,” says Micko, adding that “regular consumption of garlic has been shown to reduce cold symptom duration and reduce the risk of getting sick.”&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a wide &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/the-30-healthiest-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of healthy foods&lt;/a&gt;, including these excellent fruits and vegetables, is a key factor for helping your body prevent and fight sickness. However, Micko reminds us that no single, magic fruit or habit works on its own. "While nutrition is an important component of optimizing immune system function, it is just one piece of the puzzle," she says. "Lifestyle factors such as adequate sleep, managing stress, regular physical activity, and minimizing alcohol also play a key role.”

Many other cancers are known to recur in the years following an initial treatment, some at much higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always in the back of your mind, and that can be stressful,” says Dutton, a retired health-care management consultant living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01570-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51849280.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Cancer-fighting immune cells could soon be engineered inside our bodies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of her treatment, Dutton had enrolled in a clinical trial called SURMOUNT. This would monitor her for sleeping cancer cells, which many researchers now think might explain at least some cancer recurrence&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These dormant tumour cells evade initial treatment and move to other parts of the body. Instead of multiplying to form tumours right away — as is typical for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02555-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02555-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;metastatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;, in which cells spread from the main tumour — the dormant cells remain asleep. They are hidden from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00126-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00126-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the immune system&lt;/a&gt; and not actively dividing. But later, they can reawaken and give rise to tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Dutton understood that her treatment might not have removed all signs of cancer, she says she was floored in 2020 when dormant cells were found in her bone marrow for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are discovering dormant tumour cells, also known as disseminated cancer cells, in association with breast, prostate, lung, colon&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and other cancers, and these cells are increasingly implicated in some metastatic cancers. An estimated 30% of people who have been successfully treated for cancer might harbour these cells, although unpublished work suggests they could be even more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, a flurry of efforts have attempted to identify and understand dormant cells, with the ultimate goal of treating them. A handful of clinical trials are now under way to test potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the first trial Dutton enrolled in only monitored the cells, she has since enrolled in a second, called CLEVER, that aims to eliminate them&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As such trials move ahead, open questions about the sleeper cells, including what induces dormancy and how to fight it, are drawing more researchers into the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re starting to see multiple groups converging on some of the same ideas, which is always very affirming,” says Cyrus Ghajar, a cancer biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. The trials under way are “a testament to just how much progress has been made”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A silent threat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of dormant tumour cells was proposed as early as the 1930s, when Australian pathologist Rupert Willis attributed some secondary cancer growths to such cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As people who had been treated for cancer began to live longer, he and others noticed that the disease sometimes returned much later, and was often even more aggressive. Despite this early proposal, the idea of dormancy didn’t catch on for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis Chodosh, a physician-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, recalls facing resistance when he began discussing the idea with colleagues more than 20 years ago. No one wanted to believe that cancer-killing drugs might be leaving something behind, he says, and drug companies weren’t interested in developing therapies for people who seemed to have been cured. Many scientists at the time said that recurrent cancers must instead be new, not linked to any past diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s only when enough evidence accumulates that you get pushed out of this way of thinking,” says Chodosh, who is a co-investigator on the SURMOUNT and CLEVER studies alongside Angela DeMichele, a medical oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51843414.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51843414.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Researchers Angela DeMichele and Lewis Chodosh stand at the interior window of a large medical building." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51843414.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Angela DeMichele (left) and Lewis Chodosh are investigating ways to target dormant tumour cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Peggy Peterson for Penn Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a handful of cellular markers, researchers have now identified dormant tumour cells in many parts of the body&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These markers can tell scientists not only whether the cells are growing and dividing, but also where the cells originated and therefore &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01110-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01110-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;which type of cancer&lt;/a&gt; they’re associated with. The methods aren’t perfect, however, and researchers are still trying to determine whether certain cells are more likely to go dormant than others, and which features define these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghajar and others have found that dormant cells leave the primary tumour early in a cancer’s progression, often before the disease has been diagnosed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. How and why these cells break away isn’t entirely clear, but after spending just minutes in circulation, they exit the bloodstream and concentrate in certain parts of the body, such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Even in these niches, dormant cells are extremely rare, amounting to just a handful among millions of healthy cells, he says. Their state of suspended animation shields them from conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, that target rapidly dividing cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petros Tsantoulis, a medical oncologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, says that dormancy differs from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01370-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01370-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;other known states such as senescence&lt;/a&gt;, in which old cells stop dividing as they prepare to die. Given the right conditions, dormant cells can begin dividing anew. Once reawakened, dormant cells multiply into tumours that replicate the full complexity of the original tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led some researchers to suggest that dormant tumour cells might be cancer stem cells, a type of cell that through renewal and differentiation might give rise to the tumour — or that, at least, they might be cancer cells with stem-like features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00216-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_26701508.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Forget lung, breast or prostate cancer: why tumour naming needs to change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dormant tumour cells have some characteristics that are commonly associated with stem cells, such as the overexpression of certain genes. Cancer biologist Joan Massagué, director of the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York City, says that stem cells spend most of their time dormant, waking only after an injury or illness — making them obvious candidates. Still, the existence of cancer stem cells is a contentious idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists seem poised to resolve some of these open questions soon. With advanced laboratory techniques that give researchers the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03768-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03768-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;study individual cells&lt;/a&gt; more closely, it’s now possible to identify, isolate and enrich dormant tumour cells for further study. Chodosh and DeMichele’s team, for example, is developing an assay to identify dormant cells. Chodosh says it is much more sensitive than existing approaches, and might ultimately improve estimates of how many people harbour dormant cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghajar, meanwhile, is settling on a different way of thinking about these cells. If a dormant cell from a breast tumour ends up in the bone marrow, for example, it might be expected to retain many features of a breast cancer cell that would enable its identification. “But what we’re finding is that these expectations don’t hold up,” Ghajar says, noting that once a cancer cell spreads, it often changes its shape, size and behaviour. “We’re going to have to go beyond a definition based on unifying features, and instead map the mutations in these cells to mutations in the originating tumour — to define a disseminated cell not by what we think it should look like, but what its genome tells us it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep–wake signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond defining dormancy, researchers want to understand how and why cells go dormant, and what sorts of triggers reawaken them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Judith Agudo, an immunologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, cells probably enter dormancy as a protective measure. As part of a tumour, individual cells might be insulated from attack by the immune system, but once on their own, “they can easily be picked off without taking steps to hide themselves”, she says. In addition, the journey through the body to a new niche is a stressful one that kills the vast majority of cells that break away. Dormancy is one way of persisting in a harsh environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that while cells are asleep, they continue to engage in crosstalk with their microenvironment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and modify themselves to actively maintain dormancy. For example, dormant cells seem to alter the expression patterns of genes involved in cell survival, including a central regulator of cell metabolism and growth called the mTOR pathway&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The cells also exploit a form of self-recycling called autophagy — literally ‘self-eating’ — that allows dormant cells to repurpose internal resources and survive with little input from their surroundings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells seem to have a complex relationship with their external environment, too, including the immune system. Julio Aguirre-Ghiso, founding director of the Cancer Dormancy Institute at the Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York City, says that the immune response is implicated not only in inducing dormancy, but also in maintaining and ending it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his team have shown that macrophages in the lungs produce a particular protein that binds to dormant breast cancer cells and reinforces dormancy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Other research has demonstrated how dormant cells can evade surveillance by immune-system cells, including T cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and natural killer cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the research suggests that cells most often remain dormant until the immune landscape is disrupted in some way, shifting the balance enough for cells to reawaken safely. These shifts might involve injury or illness, with studies in the past few years linking cellular damage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and COVID-19 and influenza infections&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to an escape from dormancy.

Cells are constantly attempting to exit dormancy after small perturbations, only to be killed. “But in moments when the balance is disrupted, that’s when we often see metastasis taking off,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peyton’s work focuses on fibrosis, the build-up of fibrous connective tissue at a damaged site. This is often associated with cancer, because stiffness helps the tumour to grow and aids in signalling between cells. But the bone marrow, where dormant cells often reside, is soft, and Peyton is interested in whether that soft environment might be one feature reinforcing dormancy. She says it’s possible that natural, age-related loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or hormonal changes in women who previously had breast cancer could trigger fibrosis, and potentially a reawakening of their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At the time of this study, approximately 20,000 deidentified PSGs were available for analysis. The dataset distribution across different splits is shown in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, with SSC constituting the largest cohort. To prevent data leakage, participants with several PSG recordings were assigned to a single split. For MESA, MROS and SHHS details, we refer readers to their original publications. Below, we describe our internal SSC dataset in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SSC dataset comprises 35,052 recordings, each lasting approximately 8 h overnight. It includes diverse waveforms such as BAS, ECG, EMG and respiratory channels, making it a high-quality resource for sleep-related research. The dataset spans recordings from 1999 to 2024 and includes participants aged 2 to 96 years. The patient demographic statistics for SSC and BioSerenity are summarized in Extended Data Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#Tab3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#Tab4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our preprocessing strategy minimizes alterations to preserve raw signal characteristics crucial for identifying nuanced patterns. Each recording contains up to four modalities: BAS, ECG, EMG and respiratory, with variable numbers of channels. For BAS, we allowed up to ten channels, for ECG two channels, for EMG four channels and for respiratory seven channels. The number and type of channels vary across sites and even between patients within the same site, depending on the study type. The types of channel available across sites are described in Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#MOESM1"&gt;15–19&lt;/a&gt;. BAS includes channels that measure brain activity from different regions (frontal, central, occipital) as well as EOG for eye movements. EMG records electrical activity in muscles, whereas ECG captures cardiac electrical function. Respiratory channels measure chest and abdominal movements, pulse readings and nasal/oral airflow. These channels were selected based on their relevance to sleep studies, guided by sleep experts&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Berry, R. B et al. The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2012)." href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d100214791e2415"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each PSG recording is resampled to 128 Hz to standardize sampling rates across participants and sites. Before downsampling, we utilized a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filter to prevent aliasing, applied in a zero-phase setting to avoid phase distortion. Finally, we standardized the signal to have zero mean and unit variance. For any signals that needed to be upsampled, this was done using linear interpolation. Due to the channel-agnostic model design, we did not need any other data harmonization. Signals are segmented into 5-s patches, with each segment embedded into a vector representation for transformer model processing. To prevent data leakage, PSGs were split into pretrain, train, validation, test and temporal test sets early in the preprocessing pipeline. Although there is overlap between the pretraining and training sets, no overlap exists with the validation, test or temporal test sets. The SHHS serves as an independent dataset not used during pretraining, instead being used to evaluate the model’s ability to adapt to a new site through lightweight fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During pretraining, the only required labels are the modality types of the signals. A self-supervised CL objective is employed for pretraining. For downstream evaluations, we consider canonical tasks such as age/sex prediction, sleep stage classification, sleep apnea classification and various patient conditions extracted from EHR data. Sleep staging and apnea labels for SSC, MESA, MROS and SHHS were annotated by sleep experts. To ensure consistency across and within datasets, Rechtschaffen and Kales labels were converted to American Academy of Sleep Medicine standard by mapping Rechtschaffen and Kales stages 3 and 4 to American Academy of Sleep Medicine standard N3. SHHS also includes diagnostic information for conditions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, congestive heart failure and death. For SSC, we paired PSG data with Stanford EHR data using deidentified patient IDs to extract demographic and diagnostic information. As BioSerenity lacks associated labels, it was used exclusively for pretraining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10"&gt;SleepFM model architecture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model architecture is illustrated in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. The architecture includes several key components that differ slightly between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. During pretraining, we employ CL as the objective function for representation learning. A single model processes all four modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first component of the architecture is the &lt;i&gt;Encoder&lt;/i&gt;, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes raw signal data for each modality separately. The encoder takes raw input vectors, where the length of each vector corresponds to a 5-s segment of the signal, referred to as a token. The input dimensions are (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is the batch size, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; is the raw temporal length of the input and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; is the number of channels for each modality. These inputs are reshaped into (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; is the sequence length representing the number of tokens (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; corresponds to the raw vector length for a single token (for example, 640 samples). Each token is then processed individually through a stack of six convolutional layers, each followed by normalization and ELU activation layers. These layers progressively reduce the temporal resolution while increasing the number of feature channels, converting the input from 1 channel to 128 channels. After this, adaptive average pooling further reduces the temporal dimensions, and a fully connected layer compresses the representation into a 128-dimensional embedding for each token. The final output of the encoder has dimensions (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; = 128.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the encoder, a sequence of transformer-based operations is applied to extract and aggregate modality-specific and temporal features. The first step is channel pooling, which aggregates token embeddings from all channels within a given modality. This operation uses an attention pooling mechanism based on a transformer layer to compute attention scores for each channel and produces a single aggregated embedding per time segment by averaging over the channel dimension. The resulting embeddings, with dimensions (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;), are then passed through a temporal transformer, which operates along the temporal dimension to capture dependencies between tokens. The temporal transformer applies sinusoidal positional encoding to the token embeddings, followed by two transformer blocks consisting of self-attention and feedforward layers, enabling the model to learn contextual relationships across the sequence. After temporal modeling, the embeddings are processed through temporal pooling, which aggregates token embeddings over the sequence length (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) for each modality. Similar to channel pooling, temporal pooling uses an attention mechanism to compute weighted averages, generating a compact representation of size (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, 128) per modality. These steps collectively ensure that the model captures both spatial and temporal dependencies while reducing dimensionality for computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final output is a single 128-dimensional embedding for each modality, used for CL during pretraining. Whereas the 5-min recordings are used exclusively for pretraining, we retain the 5-s-level embeddings for each modality for downstream tasks such as sleep staging and disease classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11"&gt;Baseline models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluate SleepFM against two carefully chosen baseline approaches to demonstrate the value of our foundation model methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first baseline is a simple demographic model that processes only patient characteristics, including age, sex, BMI and race/ethnicity information. This demographic baseline is implemented as a one-layer MLP to establish a minimum performance threshold using only basic patient data available in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second baseline is the more sophisticated End-to-End PSG model that directly processes raw sleep recordings. This model uses the same architecture as SleepFM, including the 1D CNN encoder, channel pooling transformer block, temporal transformer block, temporal pooling transformer block and the LSTM layers, and is trained from scratch on the same dataset used for downstream evaluation. It also includes age and sex demographic features to ensure a fair comparison, but does not leverage any pretraining, serving to isolate the benefit of task-specific supervised learning on PSG signals without a foundation model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All baseline models were trained using dataset splits shown in Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#Tab1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. The foundation model was first pretrained on the training dataset using a self-supervised objective, and subsequently fine-tuned on the same data. In contrast, the supervised baseline models were trained end-to-end without any pretraining. Although all models share identical architectures, training objectives and data splits, SleepFM consistently outperforms both baselines across a range of clinical prediction tasks. Although this may seem counterintuitive—given that the supervised PSG baseline is trained on the same data—these results align with well-established benefits of pretraining in representation learning. Self-supervised pretraining enables the model to learn more generalizable physiological representations, facilitates better convergence through improved initialization and makes more efficient use of sparse or noisy supervision during fine-tuning, as demonstrated in previous work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Thapa, R. et al. SleepFM: multi-modal representation learning for sleep across brain activity, ECG and respiratory signals. Proc. Mach. Learning Res. 235, 48019–48037 (2024)." href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#ref-CR11" id="ref-link-section-d100214791e2547"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12"&gt;Model training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Model training can be categorized into two segments: pretraining and fine-tuning. The pretraining stage involves self-supervised representation learning with a CL objective and fine-tuning involves training the model with supervised learning objective for specific tasks such as sleep stage classification, sleep apnea classification and disease prediction. We describe these in more details below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec13"&gt;Pretraining&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Model pretraining is performed using a self-supervised learning objective called CL. Specifically, we employ a CL objective for several modalities, referred to as LOO-CL. The key idea behind CL is to bring positive pairs of embeddings from different modalities closer in the latent space while pushing apart negative pairs. Positive pairs are derived from temporally aligned 5-min aggregated embeddings, obtained after temporal pooling, across four different modalities. All other nonmatching instances within a training batch are treated as negative pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In LOO-CL, we define a predictive task where an embedding from one modality attempts to identify the corresponding embeddings from the remaining modalities. For each modality &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, we construct an embedding &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\bar{x}}_{k}^{-i}\)&lt;/span&gt; by averaging over embeddings from all other modalities, excluding modality &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. We then apply a contrastive loss between the embedding of modality &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and this LOO representation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equa" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${{\mathcal{L}}}_{i,k}=-\log \frac{\exp \left({\rm{sim}}({x}_{k}^{i},{\bar{x}}_{k}^{-i})/\tau \right)}{\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{m = 1}^{N}\exp \left({\rm{sim}}({x}_{k}^{i},{\bar{x}}_{m}^{-i})/\tau \right)},$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\mathcal{L}}}_{i,k}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the loss for a sample &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; from modality &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; in a given batch, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\rm{sim}}(\cdot )\)&lt;/span&gt; represents a similarity function (for example, cosine similarity) and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; is a temperature scaling parameter. The numerator computes the similarity between the embedding of modality &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and the LOO representation of the corresponding sample, whereas the denominator sums the similarities across all samples within the batch. The motivation behind the LOO method is to encourage each embedding to align semantically with all other modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;Fine-tuning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pretraining with the CL objective, we extract 5-s embeddings for all patient PSG data across modalities. We standardize the temporal context to 9 h for all patients—longer recordings are cropped and shorter ones are zero-padded to ensure consistent input dimensions. For example, for a patient’s standardized 9-h sleep data, the resulting patient matrix has dimensions (4 × 6,480 × 128), where 4 represents the number of modalities, 6,480 is the number of 5-s embeddings for 9 h of sleep and 128 is the embedding vector dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During fine-tuning, we first apply a channel pooling operation across different modalities, reducing the dimensions to (6,480 × 128) for our example patient matrix. The pooled embeddings are then processed through a two-layer LSTM block, which is designed to handle temporal sequences. For sleep staging tasks, these 5-s embeddings are passed directly through a classification layer. For all other tasks, the embeddings are first pooled along the temporal dimension before being passed through an output layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For disease classification, we append age and sex features to the mean-pooled embedding vector after the LSTM block, before passing it to the final output layer. This addition empirically improves performance and surpasses the demographic baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fine-tuning objective for disease prediction uses the CoxPH loss function—a standard approach in survival analysis for modeling time-to-event data. The CoxPH loss maximizes the partial likelihood and is defined for a single label as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equb" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{CoxPH}}}=-\frac{1}{{N}_{e}}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\delta }_{i}\left({h}_{i}-\log \sum _{j\in R({t}_{i})}\exp ({h}_{j})\right),$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the predicted hazard for the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;th patient, &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the event indicator (1 for event occurrence, 0 otherwise), &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the event or censoring time, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the risk set of all patients with event times greater than or equal to &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the total number of patients and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({N}_{e}=\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n}{\delta }_{i}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our multilabel setup with 1,041 labels, we extend the CoxPH loss by computing it independently for each label and summing the results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equc" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{total}}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k=1}^{L}{{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{CoxPH}}}^{(k)},$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; is the total number of labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the large dataset size, computing the loss for all patients in a single batch is computationally infeasible. Therefore, we calculate the loss in smaller batches of 32 samples, with patients sorted by event time in descending order to ensure correct computation of the partial likelihood. This batching strategy, combined with the summation of per-label losses, provides an efficient and scalable approach for multilabel time-to-event modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Architectural details&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide additional implementation-level details to clarify how SleepFM is constructed and trained. The design of SleepFM was developed through an empirical and iterative process, informed by domain knowledge and guided by practical training considerations. Although we did not perform an exhaustive hyperparameter search, we systematically evaluated architectural variants through trial-and-error by monitoring loss convergence, training stability and downstream performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each 5-s segment of raw PSG signals (640 timepoints at 128 Hz) is passed through a tokenizer composed of six convolutional layers with increasing feature maps: 1 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → 64 → 128. Each convolutional block includes BatchNorm, ELU activation and LayerNorm. After convolution, adaptive average pooling reduces the temporal axis to 1, and a linear layer projects the features to a fixed 128-dimensional token embedding. The resulting output shape is (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, 128), where &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; is the number of channels and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; is the number of 5-s tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accommodate variability in the number and ordering of channels across different PSG datasets, we introduced an attention-based spatial pooling layer that operates across channels using a transformer encoder. This design makes the model robust to inconsistencies in recording configurations across sites. Specifically, embeddings from several channels within a modality are pooled using multihead self-attention, producing a modality-specific sequence of shape (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, 128).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To capture long-range temporal dependencies in sleep signals, the pooled token sequence is passed through three transformer encoder layers (each with eight heads, batch-first configuration and a dropout rate of 0.3), along with sinusoidal positional encoding and LayerNorm. This component enables modeling of contextual relationships across the sleep sequence. The output shape remains (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, 128).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional attention-based pooling layer aggregates the temporal sequence across timesteps, resulting in a single 128-dimensional embedding for each modality (for example, BAS, ECG, EMG or respiratory). These fixed-size modality-specific embeddings are used for pretraining with a self-supervised CL objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For downstream disease prediction, 5-s token embeddings spanning a standardized 9-h window are processed by a fine-tuning head. This head includes spatial pooling followed by a two-layer bidirectional LSTM (hidden size: 64). Temporal mean pooling is applied across valid timesteps, and normalized age and sex features are concatenated with the pooled output. The combined vector is then passed through a final linear layer to generate hazard scores for each disease. The total number of learnable parameters in this setup is approximately 0.91 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supervised baseline model uses the same architecture as SleepFM but is trained from scratch without pretraining. The demographics-only baseline passes four input features—age, sex, BMI and race/ethnicity—through a shallow MLP with dimensions 4 → 128 → output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Implementation details&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All implementations were carried out using PyTorch, a library used widely for deep learning. The PSG data was gathered and processed within a HIPAA-compliant and secure compute cluster on Google Cloud Platform. Patient EHR data was likewise stored and analyzed exclusively within this secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For pretraining, the model was trained with a batch size of 32, a learning rate of 0.001, eight pooling heads, three transformer layers and a dropout rate of 0.3. As previously described, each patch size corresponds to a 5-s segment, and the total sequence length is 5 min for the transformer model. The total parameter count for the model was approximately 4.44 million. Pretraining was performed on 432,000 h of sleep data collected from 48,000 participants for one epoch, using an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The entire pretraining process took approximately 15 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fine-tuning, the batch size was also set to 32, with a learning rate of 0.001, four pooling heads, two LSTM layers and a dropout rate of 0.3. The fine-tuned model had approximately 0.91 million learnable parameters. Training was conducted on patient data, with each token embedding represented as a 128-dimensional vector, over ten epochs. The fine-tuning process was performed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, with the total training time per epoch ranging from 2 to 5 min, depending on the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data analysis and preprocessing were performed using Python (v.3.10.14) and its data analysis libraries, including Pandas (v.2.1.1), NumPy (v.1.25.2), SciPy (v.1.11.3), scikit-survival (v.0.23.0), scikit-learn (v.1.5.2) and PyTorch (v.2.0.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04133-4#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:03:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1Bb18waG5OdVN5MEEyNFhpMFJfN05fQmxVNjRXb2tLV2hubmlQczQxUTQzRDd1Y216TlZ6d0VTaEFZakRRaFBVLVRyRGNaaS00SHU4ZkJnMFcxbTFoendR</guid></item><item><title>研究提出了关于间歇性禁食益处的严重问题- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/study-raises-serious-questions-about-the-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The notion behind &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intermittent-fasting-does-work-for-weight-loss-but-only-if-you-follow-this-rule"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; is simple: eat less for a time, improve your metabolism. The reality is more complex, and a new study finds that some forms of intermittent fasting do not alter markers of metabolic or cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by a team from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke (DIfE), put 31 women &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-cells-seem-to-cling-to-the-memory-of-being-obese-study-finds"&gt;who were overweight&lt;/a&gt; or obese on two different intermittent fasting schedules for two weeks each. The schedules were 8 am to 4 pm or 1 pm to 9 pm, a particular kind of intermittent fasting known as time-restricted eating (TRE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the timing of the schedules differed, the diet parameters were the same: participants could eat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-fat-diets-may-break-the-brains-ability-to-regulate-calories"&gt;like they normally did&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore take in the same amount of total calories (making this what's known as an isocaloric study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-fasting-style-diet-seems-to-result-in-dynamic-changes-to-human-brains"&gt;A Fasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the women lost some weight, other benefits that might be expected based on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.04.010"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; – including lower blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-how-to-actually-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; – didn't show up in the data, raising questions about just how effective these timed fasting routines are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The beneficial cardiometabolic effects described previously might be induced by TRE-mediated calorie restriction and not by the shortening of the eating window itself," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adv6787"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this nearly isocaloric trial, no improvements in metabolic parameters were observed after two weeks of TRE."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187651" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/GlucoseProfile.jpg" alt="Glucose level chart" class="wp-image-187651 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/GlucoseProfile.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/GlucoseProfile-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187651" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at health indicators like glucose levels.

The timing of their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-why-you-wake-up-minutes-before-your-alarm"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, including those that nudge the body towards sleep, was shifted based on the TRE schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's more evidence that our internal clocks can be partially controlled by when we drink and eat, as well as through other triggers (such as when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stunning-sunset-images-on-the-moon-could-help-solve-enduring-mystery"&gt;the Sun goes down&lt;/a&gt;).

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Local doctors say a perfect storm has developed, a rapidly spreading strain of influenza A compounded by a drop in vaccination rates and an increase in holiday travel, which could elongate the flu surge into spring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is one of those seasons where everything is lining up in the wrong direction,” said Dr. Vandana Madhavan, clinical director of infectious disease at Mass General Brigham for Children. “It’s hard to say when our peak is going to be, and in some years, we see a second peak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At the end of December, the number of visits to health care providers for flu-like illness jumped to 11.8 percent, up from 7.6 percent the week before, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The share of emergency room visits that resulted in a hospitalization for influenza rose to 9 percent — nearly double from the previous week and triple the rate from the same time last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Each day last week, there were nearly 9,000 emergency department visits statewide, with about one-quarter of those related to acute respiratory illness, including flu, COVID-19, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last year, flu hospitalizations in Massachusetts peaked in early February, when about 10.5 percent of hospital admissions were attributed to influenza. This year’s trajectory suggests the state could meet or surpass that mark, said Dr. Larry Madoff, of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The flu season is likely to continue well into the spring. Typically, it doesn’t peak until late January or February,” said Madoff, medical director of the department’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Starting Tuesday, Brown University Health will require surgical masks or N95s for all patients, visitors, and staff at all times across its locations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island due to high rates of hospital infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nationally, the picture is similarly grim. Through Dec. 27, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reported “very high” flu activity in more than half the states. The agency estimates there have been at least 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths so far this season, including at least nine children nationwide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the state, 32 influenza-related deaths have been reported this season — 29 adults and three children, including &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-pediatric-death-influenza/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-pediatric-death-influenza/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link"&gt;one child who died during Christmas week&lt;/a&gt;. Last season, which ran from fall to summer, there were 470 influenza-related deaths. The state is also reviewing two possible COVID-19-associated deaths and one RSV-associated death in individuals younger than 18 years.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Influenza is a contagious viral illness that attacks the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, and lungs. Typical symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and extreme fatigue, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. This season, clinicians are reporting fevers as high as 104 or 105 degrees in some patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doctors say the intensity of this year’s outbreak is driven by a dominant strain of influenza A H3N2 — specifically, a genetic variant known as &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among influenza A H3N2 viruses that have undergone further genetic analysis at the CDC, about 90 percent belong to subclade K. While experts are still studying whether it causes more severe disease, early evidence suggests it spreads more quickly and may be better at evading existing community immunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Internationally, subclade K has already raised alarms. Health leaders in the United Kingdom warned in November of a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;once-in-a-decade&lt;/a&gt;” winter flu surge as infections rose sharply among young people. The strain has also been detected in Canada and Japan, where authorities declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock"&gt;flu epidemic as early as October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It really did feel like a switch flipped,” said Dr. Zachary Binder, an associate professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan Medical School and a pediatric emergency medicine physician at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester. “We went from seeing hardly any flu to over half the patients in the emergency department being flu positive.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Binder said more than half the patients he treated in recent weeks had influenza A, and many children experienced febrile seizures triggered by dangerously high fevers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are seeing an absolute explosion in flu cases over the last few weeks,” Binder said. “When we see kind of severe cases, even death, it’s most often in children with underlying health conditions like asthma, other respiratory illnesses, or cardiac illnesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another major factor is the lack of vaccination. Only about 34 percent of Massachusetts residents have received a flu shot so far this season, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases"&gt;state’s tracker&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a drop from last year, when roughly 40 percent of residents were vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Complicating matters further, the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-subclade-k-flu-and-vaccine-protection-against-it" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;newly mutated strain&lt;/a&gt;, which was surging earlier in the UK, appears to be only a partial match to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/03/metro/healey-covid-booster-massachusetts-trump-kennedy-vaccine-2/?p1=StaffPage&amp;amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&amp;amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;this year’s vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Each year, scientists must predict which flu strains are most likely to circulate months in advance, and this year’s prediction missed the mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff, of the state’s Department of Public Health, said even though the circulating strain “is not a perfect match for the vaccine, a vaccine is far better than no vaccine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He said it’s unfortunate that more people are choosing not to vaccinate in the state, and combats the federal health officials’ &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/nation/childhood-vaccine-cdc-schedule-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/nation/childhood-vaccine-cdc-schedule-overhaul/"&gt;decision Monday&lt;/a&gt; to slash recommended childhood vaccinations under President Trump’s directive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think it’s the wrong move at the wrong time,” Madoff said. “It flies in the face of what doctors recommend and what our professional organizations recommend. This guidance seems to backtrack on important protections for our children, and backing off on those recommendations, weakening those recommendations in any way, is exactly the wrong thing to be doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The reasons for declining flu vaccination rates are complex. Some experts point to pandemic fatigue such as&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;reduced routine care visits, and lingering skepticism about vaccines following COVID-19. Others note that people may underestimate the severity of influenza compared with other respiratory viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, physicians in Massachusetts stress that the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It does take a couple of weeks to get full protection from vaccination,” Madhavan said. “Now is the time, if you haven’t gotten vaccinated, to get vaccinated, to get some protection on board. And I would say that for COVID as well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pediatric specialists say they are seeing more &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/22/metro/super-flu-virus-children-kids/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/22/metro/super-flu-virus-children-kids/"&gt;severe complications in children&lt;/a&gt; than usual. Madhavan, with Mass General Brigham for Children, said she has treated patients with acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare but serious complication of influenza that can cause sudden changes in mental status, difficulty speaking or eating, problems with movement, and, in severe cases, trouble breathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Severe flu cases are more common in children with underlying health conditions, but even otherwise healthy children can become critically ill, doctors warn. Parents are urged to watch for signs of dehydration, difficulty breathing, persistent high fever, or lethargy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For home care, Madhavan recommends aggressive hydration, including popsicles and electrolyte solutions like Pedialyte, along with controlling fever using ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Honey can help soothe coughs in children older than 1, she recommends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;COVID-19 activity in Massachusetts remains relatively low compared with influenza, though health officials caution that seasonal waves can overlap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For now, doctors and public health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated, stay home when sick, wash hands frequently, and seek medical care early if symptoms worsen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff recommends residents seek care as soon as symptoms onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are treatments available, and the earlier those treatments are started, the more beneficial they are,” he said. “For the vulnerable populations like young children, older adults, those with underlying medical conditions, those with respiratory issues or cardiovascular issues, Tamiflu and other treatments can be lifesaving.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

They’re known to play a significant role in putting us in a state of rest and digest (as opposed to fight or flight), and studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can calm and regulate some bodily functions. (The potential cardiac side effects of stimulating the right means that VNS concentrates almost exclusively on the left.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="n-content-pullquote o3-editorial-typography-pullquote n-content-pullquote--no-image" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to feel I had more energy just after the first week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most notably, VNS implants have long been used by doctors to treat epilepsy. But the vagus nerve can also be stimulated via the skin, usually in or around the left ear, using small electrical pulses that give a tingling sensation. A number of devices on the market claim to do this safely, and some have been shown to have positive effects for specific conditions. One, &lt;a href="https://gammacore.co.uk/" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;GammaCore&lt;/a&gt;, is available on the NHS to treat cluster headaches via neck-based VNS. Another, made by German firm tVNS Technologies, is being used in a £2mn study (&lt;a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/ctru/current-trials/triceps" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;Triceps&lt;/a&gt;) at Sheffield University into treating arm weakness following a stroke, funded by the NIHR Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation board, the Association of British Neurologists and the Stroke Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="mdnrlywm" class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ad1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ad1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ad1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="Yōjō vagus stimulation device and subscription, £399 per year" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yōjō vagus stimulation device and subscription, £399 per year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers indicate that the nerve’s size means that stimulating it could have wider beneficial effects relating to fatigue, digestive disorders and more. Parasym, makers of a device called &lt;a href="https://nurosym.com/en-gb" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;Nurosym&lt;/a&gt;, has published more than 50 clinical studies including one showing a 32 per cent improvement in memory. Anecdotal evidence, meanwhile, is rich. “My energy levels have been such an obvious difference,” says Andrea, COO of a medical education company, who uses a device called &lt;a href="https://www.yojo.health/" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;Yōjō&lt;/a&gt; to treat chronic migraines. “I started to feel like I had more energy just after the first week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="xwluzhqk" class="n-content-heading-2 o3-editorial-typography-chapter"&gt;No&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word “vague” comes from the same Latin word, and could be used to describe some of the feelgood claims made for VNS devices. While users have credited them with improving sleep patterns, symptoms of IBS and much else, the reasons are not properly understood. “It might improve someone’s mental health, and if it works for them then who am I to argue, but as a doctor I can’t prescribe it,” says Professor Arshad Majid, chief investigator of the Triceps trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A96e0d359-753a-4895-b618-fb4547ae8fa7?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A96e0d359-753a-4895-b618-fb4547ae8fa7?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F96e0d359-753a-4895-b618-fb4547ae8fa7.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="TVNS E with Legacy Electrode, €3,500" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;TVNS E with Legacy Electrode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; €3,500&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.t-vns.com/en/" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A29a79fe6-b45d-4e6c-bd3e-23617966c0ad?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A29a79fe6-b45d-4e6c-bd3e-23617966c0ad?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F29a79fe6-b45d-4e6c-bd3e-23617966c0ad.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="Nurosym, €700" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurosym&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£599&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nurosym.com/en-gb/products/nurosym-v2" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be able to understand which device is better, we would need some sort of signal of efficacy to measure,” he continues. For its part, Yōjō pairs with an app that does a face scan via your phone’s camera to estimate blood pressure, HRV and pulse, with the aim of building up a picture of said efficacy – but in my own tests its estimation of my blood pressure was rather different to readings from a cuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stimulating the vagus nerve pathway via the ear is biologically plausible, but there are many questions left to answer – which stimulation settings? When? For how long?” says Tiago da Silva Costa, senior research fellow in Psychiatry at Newcastle University. His colleague, Hamish McAllister-Williams, professor of affective disorders at the same institution, agrees. “I think that the main benefit that people get from some devices may be more of a placebo response. But they are probably safe, probably do not harm and may at least get people to relax for periods of the day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFByM2VFR3NoVk85WHVORW5leTZPYUxMMC1FN2dKVzljVHd3Z1lPQ2dVRi10UTRWVGlvclEwOFU1U19vMWs2NWVfX1dseWxfNk1iWUZnRV9mVG9KZHVoYWZtLVpzcy1XTkFFeDZZeVlJUVc</guid></item><item><title>如何帮助身体排毒- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260105-how-to-help-your-body-detox-itself</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Fibre also helps &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105045/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;protect the kidneys and liver&lt;/a&gt; – both crucial for removing toxins from the body – by protecting them from harmful bacteria and helping beneficial bacteria to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/food/articles/fibremaxxing" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;increase your fibre intake&lt;/a&gt;, plant-based foods are your best bet. Dried fruits like apricots, leafy vegetables like spinach and legumes like a chickpeas, lentils and beans are all high in fibre, as are porridge oats and wholewheat bread and pasta. Snack on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nutrition/high-fiber-foods" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;apples, berries, nuts, seeds, popcorn&lt;/a&gt; or roasted pulses. Lots of variety is key, since there are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996925001802#b0645" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;lots of different fibres with different properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="drink-more-water" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="drink-more-water" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Drink more water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Water helps to remove toxins from the body by helping the kidneys and liver to excrete waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The kidneys, for instance, use water to flush out toxins such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kidney.org.uk/kidneys-the-basics" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;sodium and urea&lt;/a&gt;. Dehydration can cause waste to build up. Over time, even mild dehydration can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kidney.org/news-stories/can-dehydration-affect-your-kidneys" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;increase the risk of kidney damage&lt;/a&gt; and make their waste clearance less effective. Drinking enough water can also help protect your kidneys in the long run – one review of 18 randomised controlled trials found that drinking more water could &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827021" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;help reduce the risk of kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;, among other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So how much water is enough to help your body perform these essential functions? The widespread advice of eight glasses of water (around two litres) is outdated, stemming from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190403-how-much-water-should-you-drink-a-day" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;advice in 1945&lt;/a&gt; which included food as a source of water.

It was followed by quick jolts, like electric shocks. As each class came and went, the pain eased and then returned with greater intensity. Four times that day I left a teaching assistant with worksheets and ran to the school bathroom to douse my face with cold water. I took ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, but the pain remained unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The headaches appeared repeatedly that autumn, and again in spring, and soon formed an annual pattern. September and October were the worst, then February and March. I could predict the routine: aura in the shower, early twinges on the train, full-blown agony in class by 9.30am. In late 2019, a GP finally referred me to a neurologist and I was diagnosed with cluster headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-v6upx6"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Cluster headaches typically begin with severe pain around one eye that lasts up to three hours &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About one in 1,000 &lt;a href="https://www.brainresearchuk.org.uk/neurological-conditions/cluster-headache" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;people are affected&lt;/a&gt; by the condition, and men are more frequently diagnosed. Cluster headaches typically begin with sudden, severe pain around one eye that peaks within minutes and lasts up to three hours. Attacks come in clusters, daily or multiple times a day, and are accompanied by red or watery eyes, drooping eyelids or facial sweating. I have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544241/#:~:text=Episodic:%2085%20to%2090%25%20of,15%20to%2020%25%20of%20patients." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the episodic form&lt;/a&gt;, which arrives in seasonal bouts; others have chronic cluster headaches, defined by the absence of long pain-free periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What unites sufferers is the intensity.

Her attacks began when she was two. “I would throw myself on the floor and bang my head. That was put down to being spoiled,” she says. Her symptoms worsened through childhood. Alcohol in her teens, &lt;a href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-4610.2008.01317.x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;like many triggers&lt;/a&gt;, made things worse. After drinking sherry at her school leaving party, she recalls barely being able to see on the bus home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her family often interpreted her attacks as drunken episodes. Support eventually came from her father and then from her husband, Rod, who was diagnosed with epilepsy in early adulthood. “I was very lucky to find such an exceptional person,” she says. “We were meant to meet.” Hobbs took clerical work after moving to Wales in 1981, but often hid her condition. She was fired from one job, partly due to absences during attacks. Her breakthrough diagnosis came in 2002 at the &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/national-hospital-neurology-and-neurosurgery" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, the inability to plan life around unpredictable attacks took its toll. She especially hated being unable to plan social events, being seen as unreliable as a colleague, and even having to be looked after by her children (at home and in public) in the midst of the paralysis caused by the worst episodes. “It robs you of the small freedoms we don’t appreciate until they’re gone,” she says. She remembers winning tickets for the queen’s golden jubilee concert, only to have an attack inside a portable toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;eadaches have been described throughout history. “The first description of headache comes by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;way of the Mesopotamians in 4000BC,” write Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin in their 2005 book, Headache Through the Ages. They attributed the disease to Tiu, an evil spirit who attacked his victims’ heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2018.0030" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Ebers Papyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a record of ancient Egyptian medical knowledge dating from 1550BC, suggests crocodiles should be wrapped around the head to combat what some modern-day observers would describe as a migraine. In the middle ages, migraine was recognised as a distinct disorder, with treatments ranging from bloodletting and herbal concoctions to other, more superstitious remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp who provided the first detailed description of a cluster headache. In his Observationes Medicae, published in 1641, Tulp speaks of a patient “afflicted with a very severe headache occurring and disappearing daily at fixed hours”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cluster headaches were only officially recognised by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society in 1988. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, they were thought to be caused by a problem with the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain, says Prof Peter Goadsby, a leading specialist in diagnosing and treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1998, Goadsby and the neuroscientist Arne May published the results of a study for which they had triggered cluster headaches in patients and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(98)02470-2/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;monitored the attacks in a brain scanner&lt;/a&gt;. The results, published in the Lancet, showed activation of the hypothalamus, which is responsible for human circadian rhythm, when patients were in pain, and a deactivation when they recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="39a021b3-9aca-491f-8889-de01d30b7492" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jamie Charteris’s cluster headaches were misdiagnosed as sinus problems.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite such advances, diagnosis remains slow. Jamie Charteris’s attacks began in 1986 and felt like “a modelling balloon being inflated behind my left eye”. GPs thought he had sinus problems; he underwent four surgeries before finally being diagnosed in 2014, after a doctor Googled his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Nicholas Silver, a neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, says delays in diagnosis and treatment happen because patients are rarely seen mid-attack. “You’re tired and depressed, but not in agony,” he says. He proceeds by ruling out other primary headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type, &lt;em&gt;hemicrania continua&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paroxysmal hemicrania&lt;/em&gt; and SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiformheadache), before diagnosing cluster headaches. A detailed history is essential: on which side do symptoms appear? For how long? What time of year? Are there triggers, such as alcohol? Do symptoms change with touch? Certain features such as redness, tearing, drooping eyelids and nasal congestion help confirm cluster headaches. Once diagnosed, patients may be referred to specialist centres including the Walton, or rapid-access clinics such as the one I attend at St Thomas’ hospital in London. But many first arrive in A&amp;amp;E or are given inadequate treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dorothy Chapman, 78, is a trustee of the UK charity Ouch (&lt;a href="https://ouchuk.org/home" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headache&lt;/a&gt;). She has experienced cluster headaches for most of her life, although she hasn’t had an attack since 2016. When she was in her 20s, she had her teeth pulled because dentists misinterpreted her pain. She believes dentists still need much more awareness. When Charteris sought help from Ouch, it was Chapman who replied to his email. I remember calling the Ouch helpline during an attack in early 2021; a calm volunteer talked me through oxygen treatment and medication until the episode eased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg150/ifp/chapter/Treatments-for-cluster-headache" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidance on treatment&lt;/a&gt; recommends sufferers are offered high-flow oxygen and/or the anti-migraine drug triptan delivered by injection or nasal spray. No tablets, painkillers or opioids should be used. Preventive options include verapamil, a blood pressure medication, which apparently soothes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/-sp-daniel-radcliffe-speculating-sexuality-harry-potter" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe’s&lt;/a&gt; bouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Dr Giorgio Lambru, the consultant neurologist who diagnosed me, believes the Nice guidance needs updating to reflect a clearer treatment pathway and help GPs avoid misprescribing. For episodic patients, he says, timing is everything: “The duration of the bout dictates the treatment.” Short bouts with infrequent attacks are handled with abortive therapy alone: triptan injections or nasal sprays, plus oxygen. Longer or more intense bouts require preventives such as verapamil, sometimes paired with steroids, which act quickly before wearing off. Many patients also receive a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24313966/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;greater occipital nerve block&lt;/a&gt; during a bout – an injection into the side of the head where the pain is that reduces nerve activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-v6upx6"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;The Nice guidance needs updating to reflect a clearer treatment pathway and help GPs avoid misprescribing&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If these fail, Lambru may consider topiramate, an anti-epilepsy medication, or vagus nerve stimulation devices. Chronic patients sometimes require multiple nerve blocks, radio-frequency treatment or, in rare cases, neuromodulation through occipital nerve stimulation, in which a battery-operated device is implanted and zaps the nerve to calm it down. Lambru stresses that, unlike in migraines, frequent use of triptans to treat cluster headache rarely causes medication-overuse headaches – an important point missing from many GP guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients also experiment with other approaches: cold air, cold showers, intense exercise, caffeine, vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/cluster-headaches-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in some cases psychedelics&lt;/a&gt;, though evidence remains largely anecdotal, according to Lambru. One promising emerging option is CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) targeting medication, used in migraine. Injectables such as galcanezumab, which aim to slow the potent inflammatory protein, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1813440" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;show potential for episodic&lt;/a&gt; cluster headache treatment &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/discontinued/gid-ta10425#:~:text=16%20November%202022-,Following%20on%20from%20information%20provided%20to%20NICE%20by%20the%20company,appraisal%20on%20its%20work%20programme." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;but are unavailable&lt;/a&gt; on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My own treatment journey has involved preventives and acute options when bouts strike. I briefly tried verapamil, but Covid restrictions made the required ECG monitoring (because of risks to the conduction of the heart) difficult. Oral steroids helped me temporarily but couldn’t be used long-term because of the increased risk of harm, such as weakened bones, eyesight problems and diabetes. Greater occipital nerve blocks became my main preventive tool. The moment I sense patterns emerging, I call the headache clinic at St Thomas’, and the nurses fit me in as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="684642a1-00ea-47a6-bf79-d716bf41661e" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Oxygen therapy constricts dilated blood vessels, reducing the pressure and pain’ … Morgan Ofori.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ethan Parker/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When attacks hit, I use high-flow medical oxygen delivered to my home in tall industrial cylinders. The relief is extraordinary. Prof Goadsby and Dr Anna Cohen’s 2009 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996400/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study showed oxygen&lt;/a&gt; could make patients pain-free within 15 minutes, leading to its approval by Nice. During a cluster attack, blood flow in the brain increases. Oxygen therapy constricts the dilated blood vessels, reducing the pressure and pain while calming down overactive nerves. The drug sumatriptan, which reduces the release of pain-causing chemicals and blocks pain signals from being transmitted to the brain, never worked for me, despite trying several forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hobbs also relies heavily on oxygen, though she believes demand-valve masks, which deliver big bursts of oxygen quickly, could improve outcomes. Ouch has campaigned for wider access to these masks, though Lambru notes evidence is still emerging. The challenge is that only about one in 10 UK patients use or have access to oxygen – a stark shortfall, considering its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t Ouch’s annual conference in Newcastle last summer, about 100 sufferers gathered with neurologists. There were quiet rooms, oxygen stations and sessions on new research and coping strategies. A recurring theme was the need for better data. Headache diaries help clinicians recognise patterns, but until recently most were kept by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inspired by his own struggles, 37-year-old web developer Darshan Ramanagoudra created MyClusters, a free app for tracking attacks, triggers and treatment effectiveness. Within its first month, users from more than a dozen countries logged thousands of attacks. Ramanagoudra hopes better data will reduce misdiagnosis and strengthen research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By the summer of 2023, I was getting multiple daily attacks. By the winter, it was about six a day, and that’s when I started reading a lot of medical papers,” says Ramanagoudra, who is based in the Netherlands. He consulted doctors and researchers to see what the online community in the Netherlands was saying, then started tracking it all on a spreadsheet. “It got a bit complicated, and I realised I could do pivot tables and things, but I figured someone else would want additional information. How were they going to do it?” The idea for MyClusters was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="469ffe48-c9f8-4f90-9ce5-4532f557ec09" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":32,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Cluster headaches are ‘the most painful condition on the planet’.

However, in terms of funding and research, “cluster headaches are given short shrift compared with the impact it has on our economies and on people’s individual lives”, he says. He believes this is a mistake. “It’s not a terminal disease, it’s a lifelong disease. But if you add up all the time a person spends being disabled by these bouts of head pain and other neurological symptoms, it adds up to a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve just emerged from my latest autumn bout. This time the pain struck on the left side, a first for me, and I received my first multi-cranial block to treat it. I was injected four times in the side of my head, plus another shot at the back. I’m not needle-phobic; I imagine I’m giving blood from my skull. The approach seems to have worked. Using MyClusters to track patterns, I’ve been headache-free for nearly six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Winter brings respite, and is a time of calm. But sometime in this new year, I know the cycle will begin again. Cluster headaches are my own recurring, disabling season, never too far around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQaHMtcE9Ha09kMzBPY3lId0lGcEQ2cXIzU0FYZHRtd3pOOTE2Vjlya2hEOU1VVl9leDhpRUlhTWtxMXFEeFpIRy1UWGZDUXpWQk1kbkN6U1ZSb1FhOHlOTzItdFJxOW5OZ1ItMTk4cGR4amRDenk0Q0dCUGNiUU53LVhwUF9YQ2htdmh2NUk5VDlMbHZ2cW1FcVdxbjdoSlNtLUdpQ2llSHA</guid></item><item><title>凯霍加县的主要过量杀手现在是可卡因。我们如何对待它？ - Cleveland.com</title><link>https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/01/cuyahoga-countys-leading-overdose-killer-is-now-cocaine-how-do-we-treat-it.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TBSDUL54HVFZBJZXS7TTQPTZAQ"&gt;CLEVELAND, Ohio — For the first time in decades, cocaine is killing more people in Cuyahoga County than opioids – including fentanyl – and the drug is going to require a different type of treatment and prevention strategy to combat it. But what could that look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MSRCJKHCTNHNNN54BMMEILLALU"&gt;Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Gilson started to notice a shift in overdose deaths early last year. As opioid overdoses continued to fall, &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/09/enemy-number-one-cocaine-now-deadlier-than-fentanyl-in-cuyahoga-county.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/09/enemy-number-one-cocaine-now-deadlier-than-fentanyl-in-cuyahoga-county.html"&gt;cocaine-related deaths were rising&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for 63% of cases, compared with 46% involving opioids, including some overlap from drug mixtures. At the time, he predicted cocaine would kill 399 Cuyahogans by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JUN2X57XUBA7LP3A5IYKINAJM4"&gt;During recent budget talks before County Council, Gilson noted cocaine deaths will drop slightly as toxicology screenings are completed, but the drug still remains the top killer. Its victims: primarily older Black residents, echoing patterns from the 1980s and 1990s crack-cocaine crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AVC3RQINONAH5JP6AH3NDHSANA"&gt;Gilson said it marks a new phase of the overdose crisis, one that will require a new kind of response than what the county developed during the opioid epidemic. That means different prevention strategies to target Black communities – which have historically had a mistrust of medical systems and limited access to addiction treatment – and a greater focus on stimulant treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="URFR45BOLNEJJM7FJE32NDKLE4"&gt;“It doesn’t mean the opioid crisis is over and the interventions that we have put forth are ineffective anymore, but we’re going to start to see stimulants, specifically cocaine and to a lesser extent methamphetamine, account for more and more overdose deaths, and we should be thinking now, how do we pivot to respond to that?” Gilson argued to County Council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TNRARQDE5FES7CJL4ZEPFI7GKQ"&gt;Addiction treatment experts say that shift could be tricky. Dr. Megan Testa, medical director of psychiatric services at the county’s Diversion Center, and Sarah Tkac, clinical manager at Oriana House, noted that the two drugs affect the body differently, requiring different treatment strategies, which just aren’t as developed for stimulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OBPOKNCLCFF5BMODMNGXASVVTY"&gt;For opioid use, there’s methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, Suboxone and Vivitrol to ease withdrawal symptoms or block the receptors that drive compulsive use, and there’s Naloxone to reverse the effects of an overdose – allowing users another chance, perhaps, to get sober. For cocaine, though, there is no overdose-reversal drug or medications to help people taper off it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KACYVQ5QYBAR7BVSANR2U2EASA"&gt;“We really have a lot of meds in our toolbox for opiate use disorder, which is probably because of the money and the research that’s gone into it,” Testa said. “But cocaine use disorder is not the same. We just don’t have those tools.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;‘There’s no pill for this’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y62O5WRR4JBCDAQQ5YHCG5KWQY"&gt;While both drugs flood the brain with the feel-good hormone dopamine, they affect the body in opposite ways. Opioids suppress the nervous system, leading to slowed breathing and overdose that can be reversed with naloxone. Cocaine and other stimulants overstimulate the heart and brain, often triggering fatal arrhythmias or strokes that come on too fast for emergency intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LICY7RPBI5GYTJBEUTTUQKBQ54"&gt;The biology shapes treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M3S5VVV4JFFS5H6X6UJCFDHP5Q"&gt;Opioid withdrawal, sometimes called “dope sickness,” can be excruciating. Users get extremely sick, experiencing muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, agitation and severe cravings that often drive them to seek out more of the drug to stop the pain. That’s why opioid addiction is typically managed through medication that curbs cravings and stabilizes the brain to reduce the risk of relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R74FW7N3HNELPO4PCC3347GWFM"&gt;Cocaine withdrawal, by contrast, is marked by psychological symptoms, such as fatigue, depression and increased appetite. Users “crash” and “just want to eat everything and sleep,” Testa said, but they don’t experience the type of physical symptoms seen with opioids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XP3CN3Z5AND53JSULZLG7THGYU"&gt;For stimulants, treatment relies almost entirely on behavioral therapies: cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing and contingency management, a reward-based approach that pays or recognizes patients for milestones like negative drug screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="55RG5LGZRZAH7APAG57JXXWCMU"&gt;“There’s no pill for this,” as Tkac puts it; which can also make it harder to treat – and to access treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7IVH4CRI3NDGHJTMQBIO2JRIQQ"&gt;Most detox centers won’t admit patients experiencing cocaine or methamphetamine withdrawal because there are no meds to manage or to bill for, the pair agree. That means people seeking help are often left to manage the symptoms and stay sober on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EBET22OSXZCNZL2VFHQMRTK63A"&gt;“Right now, you can walk in anywhere and get some kind of detox treatment for opioids, but if you go with a cocaine disorder, you could be shown the door,” Tkac said. “So maybe that’s where we need to pivot in this community to be more open to whatever substance people present with.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Ideas for more effective treatment &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L2YBCP5ZYBDZZHZWDM45BY56RQ"&gt;Some researchers have been exploring vaccines to prevent cocaine highs or other methods that might help people metabolize stimulants faster, which may mitigate the potential for overdoses. Others have been testing the effects of mood-stabilizers on treating cocaine to replace the dopamine hit they crave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6BTYOXOH6RBJLAD3CVLTATWPNY"&gt;Testa said they even prescribe some of those medications at the Diversion Center, the county-owned treatment center, but they’re not FDA-approved for cocaine treatment. They’re “off-label” uses, until the research catches up, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WT2P6NWNSNDQZPRMP3V75GJKFQ"&gt;To truly close the gap, the experts say treatment centers will need to view stimulant use disorder as seriously as opioid addiction and beef up behavioral health care to address it, rather than relying on medication management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YGAX5775HJEDFINEWEYYASXBXE"&gt;Because “drugs are never the problem,” Tkac stressed, they’re just the solution people use to deal with whatever problem they’re seeking to avoid, often rooted in some kind of trauma. She noted that over 90% of the clients they see at Oriana House have been diagnosed with PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="34NAYOH2HJDLNA24BP5OSPVEEE"&gt;In those cases, the majority of people are using drugs as a coping mechanism to avoid feeling pain. Removing the drug doesn’t address the underlying cause, they said, it just sends people searching for another filler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MN56ZMFEO5B6RARUGBPYRV26II"&gt;“If we’re not treating the problem, it doesn’t matter what substance you use,” Tkac said. “So, really getting good trauma therapy is one of the most essential things you can do for recovery, because that’s the problem.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XGARJCPY4VBAXAT2FW4M7RWE7E"&gt;That starts with reducing the mental health stigma so people are more open to treatment options. It also means beefing up recovery coaching for stimulant users, so they have peer support while they address their addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VR4DDUSK3BFZNPQU223ODQQCNI"&gt;But above all, it means “meeting people where they’re at,” Testa argued. That means providing harm reduction tools in the meantime, like safer-smoking kits with supplies to prevent exposure to other toxins and communicable diseases, and fentanyl test strips to avoid contamination that may increase the likelihood of an overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5ZP27TQUT5GLLONJD7PAZEVA6Y"&gt;She equated it to the needle exchange programs that became more popular during the heroin and opioid epidemics and reduced the spread of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5SI2QXEQCZDOZEDAJQSJDTLVLM"&gt;“It brought people into treatment,” Testa said. “It didn’t just help people use more, those people were going to use anyways, but...it helped people use more safely and get into treatment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NJ4AJJJZTRA67L7J6NPAQUIJUA"&gt;Without these shifts, the experts say the system can only keep playing catch-up. It was the same fear Gilson expressed when urging the county to act now to address cocaine overdoses – before more lives are lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6GYJBGSWVBGCHE35I4H7G3VU4M"&gt;“This is a population who paid with their life to teach us a lesson,” Gilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:BN5TBABJ6ZHCXAOPNOU4DHSUE4" data-fusion-component="BN5TBABJ6ZHCXAOPNOU4DHSUE4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:BN5TBABJ6ZHCXAOPNOU4DHSUE4" data-fusion-component="BN5TBABJ6ZHCXAOPNOU4DHSUE4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cleveland.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
