We’d like to try it, but we’ve always been told how unsafe it is.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnxoct00383b78mzdgq549@published"&gt;We’ve noticed there’s more and more “ass to pussy.” How do the women who do it in porn do it? Do they gobble antibiotics? Do they have secrets for cleaning out really well? Do they just suffer with infections for the sake of a paycheck? Or is it not really as unsafe as we’re told?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwn001z3b78to66am6j@published"&gt;I don’t think the best question here is how adult performers with vaginas mitigate the risks of transferring anal bacteria to those vaginas. Everyone has their own tricks and tips. Many of these methods are medically unsound. Adult is pretty crucial to the adult film industry—there are mountains of paperwork to prove that everyone is of age—so performers are considered able to weigh the risks, the financial pressures, and their own boundaries to make their own decisions. Much like you and your girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwn00203b782w67qdle@published"&gt;Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the associate medical director at Planned Parenthood, has the answer to your last and most relevant question: “Unfortunately, transitioning from anal penetrative sex directly to vaginal penetrative sex can lead to vaginal infections. It’s important to understand that while the vagina has lots of bacteria, the GI tract has much more bacteria and different bacteria that shouldn’t be present in the vagina, and this can lead to infections in the vagina that can be difficult to treat.” The risks are significant: “In worst case scenarios, an infection of this time can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which is when a vaginal infection progresses to the uterus or fallopian tubes.” Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause permanent damage, including fertility problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnts2l00343b78aapt0yuo@published"&gt;There are some ways you can mitigate this, but most aren’t all that helpful. “Things like anal douching before anal sex or washing fingers, toys, or penis after anal sex can reduce this risk, and help might avoid an infection every time, but the infection risk is still high,” De-Lin said. Since I expect the lure of something risky, or forbidden, or whatever it is that interests you about inserting your penis into your girlfriend’s vagina directly after being in her asshole, is strong enough for you to write in, I’m hoping De-Lin’s last suggestion will suffice: “The best bet is to use a new condom when transitioning from anal to vaginal sex, or make sure that the progression is from vaginal to anal instead.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwo00243b78y410xwbd@published"&gt;I’m recently out of a long-term relationship that was also long-distance for about a year. Whenever I would see my partner in person, we rarely had sex unless we had been drinking. I chalked this up to the stress of traveling, the stress in the relationship, etc. Now that I’ve left the relationship and am dating again, I’m finding that I still have a hard time getting over the nerves of sleeping with someone without alcohol. I’m bisexual and have noticed this showing up no matter the gender of the person I’m on a date with. I otherwise have a healthy relationship with alcohol and drinking culture. I’m 28 and sloppy drunk first-time hookups feel juvenile now, but how the hell am I supposed to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwp00273b78q3s14sod@published"&gt;It seems like you’ve tried hooking up without the hooch, and I’m wishing I had more information about how that has played out in the past. Did you refrain from going home together? Did you stop the sex? Engage in heavy sexual interaction and not find it satisfying? Regardless, as you try to hook up without it, just like medical marijuana packages advise, start low and go slow.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="185" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwp00283b78t9kco9ph@published"&gt;You might tell your potential partners something like “I’m working through some anxiety right now and am not sure how far I want to go sexually tonight, but I’d like to see what happens.” Or, “I definitely want to kiss you, and I’m not sure about anything else.”&lt;br&gt;Listen to your body. You can find the edge of anxiety—that blurred space where you’re a little past your comfort zone but you’re able to stay present and engaged—and hang out there for a while. Take some deep breaths. Exist in the moment. If you start to check out, call for a stop and do something that grounds you. For some people, that’s holding ice, or biting a lemon. For others, it’s a mental exercise or even a physical one. Whatever you have to do to inhabit your body and get back into the present. If checking out is a thing that you notice recurring, that’s something you’ll need to warn your partners about. Instead of a safeword, you’ll want them to understand that an absence of positive feedback means they should stop what they’re doing and disengage.&lt;/p&gt;

Did he just, like, grunt as he motioned in the general area of his balls? Truth be told, I have no idea what your boyfriend wants you to do with his balls. He might like them pulled. He might like them sucked. He might like you to pop ’em in your mouth like little bits of breaded chicken or lap at them so lightly as though you’re catching snow with your tongue. Ask him. If you’re too embarrassed, go down and start kissing them gently, maybe licking them for bit and wait for him to direct you. If he doesn’t, ask him if he likes what you’re doing after a few minutes. If he still doesn’t have anything to add, it could mean one of two things: You can do whatever and he’ll be happy (in that case, rejoice: An easy-going partner is a gift), or he’s not such a ball play connoisseur after all and it still doesn’t really matter what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I love playing scenarios, and with former partners spent a good amount of time talking about who we’d like to be and what we’d like to do. But my boyfriend prefers improv and just seeing where it takes us. It has taken us to some unexpected, yet interesting places, and I’ve done things I never would have agreed to had we discussed it ahead of time. I’ve discovered my threshold for pain is greater than I realized, and it has resulted in some of the best orgasms I’ve ever had. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/06/roleplay-punishment-weirdness-advice.html"&gt;My problem is not what he does to me, but why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now researchers say internet searches for the anti-anxiety drug surged after the show’s release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lorazepam, also known by its brand name Ativan, is a type of drug known as a benzodiazepine, or “benzo”. It is thought to work by boosting the effect of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US say the name-dropping of lorazepam on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-white-lotus" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt; has fuelled a rise in interest around the drug and how to access it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Olivia Maynard of the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study, described the data as striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That this TV show is causing people to explore purchasing benzodiazepines online is particularly concerning because there is a huge amount of illicit production of benzodiazepines, and these drugs are often dosed incorrectly and/or inconsistently and sometimes contain different drugs entirely,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Recently, some illicit ‘benzodiazepines’ which people have bought online have been found to contain nitazenes, a dangerous synthetic opioid, which could lead to overdose or even death if taken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego analysed data from Google, finding that, while searches for lorazepam were stable from January 2022 to the end of the first week of February 2025, they surged after the third season of The White Lotus was released on 16 February and remained at increased levels for the next 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, the team say there were almost twice as many searches relating to lorazepam over this 12-week period than would normally be expected, equating to about 1.6m additional searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was also an increase in the number of searches about how to get hold of lorazepam, with such queries about 64% higher than expected for the 12-week period – reflecting about 30,000 extra searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, no such spikes were seen for searches related to alprazolam or clonazepam – benzodiazepines not mentioned in The White Lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.4931" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;, cannot unpick whether people were simply searching for information about lorazepam or buying the drug, the researchers say the results raise concerns given the rise in prescribing of such medications and the increase in illegitimate online pharmacies selling benzodiazepines without prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers also warn The White Lotus did not portray the risks of suddenly stopping lorazepam – noting this can cause panic attacks, agitation, and seizures – or convey the dangers of drinking alcohol while taking benzodiazepines. As the NHS website notes: “It can make you sleep very deeply. You may have breathing problems and difficulty waking up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers say the entertainment industry should develop ‘best practice’ approaches to how prescription medications are shown, adding the use of health information panels could sate curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores University, said that, while signposting to further advice and support is sometimes included at the end of shows, there are other approaches to keeping viewers safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Whilst it could be useful if entertainment shows incorporated health advice where potentially harmful products are prominent, I don’t think this is realistic to expect from a creative point of view, and there is the risk that heavy-handed warnings can lead to counterproductive outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Where access to medicines is concerned, I think the greatest impacts will be seen through enforcement action against illicit manufacturers and unregulated providers, and prescriber education, as over-[prescribing] or inappropriate prescribing of clinically useful but potentially harmful medicines remains a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNc0NKQnBRZTQtejVsU3FTOXo0cFRYV0lPdGJIbWpKeVVVUWFTTjZyeWRVUE9TanVMeV9DY2xINktCOWNXU0xCRDZzYkxRemdjMjFmWWo0SGRIUDhiYVhqbV9HemVKZVBOcVN0azBmMENJZ0tTUVc1YlZPOFVOTVFqMDFzSzdWTmVYYlRrd0xxZnhjZE9xY0dqdTlOSGc0UlB5X1YtWERMc1FXMUNmR0E</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， “白莲花”引发了网上对高风险焦虑药的兴趣-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/14/white-lotus-benzodiazepines-lorazepam-interest/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="topper-text-elems" class="wpds-c-kebnqj wpds-c-kebnqj-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-topper" class="wpds-c-cBzrLX wpds-c-cBzrLX-cmVlgk-isCenterNS-false wpds-c-cBzrLX-iyHTpF-useUATStyles-true wpds-c-cBzrLX-ieuxqEo-css"&gt;&lt;h1 id="main-content" data-qa="headline" data-testid="headline" class="wpds-c-eRlesA wpds-c-eRlesA-dHdMuz-isOnSplitTopper-false wpds-c-eRlesA-bAbYzz-isStyle-false wpds-c-eRlesA-iPJLV-css"&gt;‘The White Lotus’ sparked online interest in risky anxiety pills, study says&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p data-qa="subheadline" data-testid="subheadline" class="wpds-c-ckOSsQ wpds-c-ckOSsQ-iPJLV-css"&gt;Google searches for lorazepam surged after anxiety pills played a significant role in Season 3 of “The White Lotus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid="timestamp" class="wpds-c-bEimne wpds-c-bEimne-dyECYW-theme-default"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2025-11-14T16:00:00.000Z" class="wpds-c-gRBhEF wpds-c-gRBhEF-idbzzBd-css overrideStyles"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-eUMOSL"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="published-date" class="wpds-c-bASIGw wpds-c-bASIGw-ilmVsQY-css overrideStyles"&gt;November 14, 2025 at 11:00 a.m. EST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="relative-date" class="wpds-c-bASIGw wpds-c-bASIGw-idUCtvg-css overrideStyles"&gt;25 minutes ago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:01:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQZGhxM3N4MWRrRHRodlhXOTJ3aC0wT1U4eGpjbW5Lci1sLW9mbVR0bGJsMTdTV1k0ektVazk5QU4zOVJoQVplN3A2LWtXcDFvcDNlMzRmeXFMYUhobmFnVkJGSVdwOHpzQkJFTDNwU1FMeEV3UG1mSERQMWNSSmNfcXJhV2pYa0cyclFOR0p2RE1udEI4cTcwLUtVTHQ</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿州可能出现人类禽流感，美国9个月内首例- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/human-bird-flu-possible-washington-state-us-months-rcna243905</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a84ec7" class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials in Washington state say they have identified the nation’s first human case of bird flu since February, &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;pending confirmatory testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cffd2f" class="body-graf"&gt;A Grays Harbor County, Washington, resident preliminarily tested positive for the infection, the Washington State Department of Health said Thursday.

The climate crisis, which is raising global temperatures and causing more ferocious rainfall, is aggravating around half of known human pathogenic diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01426-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists have determined&lt;/a&gt;, as disease-carrying mosquitoes expand their range across a rapidly heating world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The sharp increase in transmitted diseases in the Amazon region comes as UN climate talks take place in Belém, a Brazilian city that sits near the mouth of the Amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health was, until a few years ago, a largely overlooked area of the climate crisis in these annual summits but the UN declared Thursday “health day” at Cop30 and promoted a new plan to help countries deal with the array of illnesses and life-threatening conditions spurred by a hotter world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Across the world, people are living the daily reality that the climate crisis is also a public health crisis,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief. “Rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and storms are claiming lives, fueling diseases and malnutrition, and placing immense pressure on health systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="29678ce3-7714-45e5-b089-630587cee50c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Children wear masks for a vaccination campaign against whooping cough and yellow fever on 08 May 2025 in Quito, Ecuador. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Agencia Press South/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stiell said the new &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/climate-change/en---belem-action-plan.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Belém Health Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;, led by Brazil’s government and the World Health Organization, will help countries with surveillance, best practices and capacity building to help them deal with climate-fueled health issues. A coalition of 35 philanthropic bodies has pledged $300m in funding for the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Humanity can only win this global climate fight if we connect stronger climate actions to people’s top priorities in their daily lives,” Stiell said. “And there are few higher priorities than our health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But climate advocates and health experts say much more will need to be done to deal with the fallout from scorching temperatures and worsening disasters such as flooding. On Wednesday, Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/29/rising-heat-kills-one-person-a-minute-worldwide-lancet-countdown" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent evidence &lt;/a&gt;that rising heat is killing one person a minute worldwide shows that governments are badly failing to curb the direct human harm of the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How long are we going to stand by … keep turning the thermostat up so that these sort of events get even worse? Gore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health experts said that several factors are causing the expansion of infectious diseases, such as the razing of forests for agriculture and housing, which is bringing humans closer to animals that can spread zoonotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s globalization as well and it’s also the fact that mosquitoes are smart and so are bacteria,” said Maria Guevara, the international medical secretary of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, who is at the Belem gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“And whether it’s bacteria or viruses, they transmit, they’re just smarter than humans in that case because they’re more adapted, and they will adapt to survive. We are much too slow. We know what we need to do about climate change, but we’re not doing anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guevara said much more will need to be done to equip countries that are having outbreaks of disease worsened by the extreme weather. MSF has in recent years had to respond to outbreaks of yellow fever in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the wake of severe droughts or floods. Distribution of vaccines can be difficult even in countries like Brazil, where yellow fever inoculations are free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’ve had huge outbreaks of dengue and an increase in yellow fever even outside of the Amazon region because of lots of rain and high temperatures, which makes the mosquitoes bite more and affects the reproduction of virus in the mosquitoes,” said Rachel Vicente, an &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r1796" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; at the health sciences center at Brazil’s Federal University of Espírito Santo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People are living near more breeding sites, too, especially in urban areas of Brazil. It’s a perfect storm and it’s not just a problem of tropical areas any more, we’ve had outbreaks in Europe because it is getting warmer there and is becoming easier for the vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all need to collaborate more on resilience because all countries will need to prepare for this now, not just some of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOSlBweXhneHUtRi1neWdNTFdEYW9zdnk5ZlR2eGlPNlEyQUhzUWFfZXNxT1YtZVY5WWhZTHowRS1rYVVTdk5uUkJCNHlqdVJSX09nNGYyejZaZzNvUGRCUVRQMnI0Sk4wdG1JZHFGLUNhNnNnOU1pSURTMVFRUWFQRFRGRjZPRVRnN3NhVjVWcEVzRThiUGJCZw</guid></item><item><title>牙齿和牙龈中出现的8种健康问题：您的微笑揭示了您的健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/8-health-problems-that-show-up-in-your-teeth-and-gums-what-your-smile-reveals-about-your-wellness/articleshow/125282265.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your teeth and gums are more than tools for chewing; they can reveal what is happening inside your body. Dentists are often the first to spot hidden health issues because many illnesses show early signs in the mouth long before other symptoms appear. Changes such as enamel erosion, gum colour, tooth mobility, or even grinding patterns can act as subtle warning signals. These oral changes may point to nutritional deficiencies, hormonal shifts, digestive problems or even conditions affecting the heart, kidneys or bones. In some cases, dental signs are the first clue that something more serious needs medical attention. Your smile says it all. Paying attention to what your mouth is telling you not only protects your smile but also supports overall well-being. Here are eight surprising things your teeth and gums may reveal about your health. Take a look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8 hidden health problems your teeth and gums may reveal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Worn or thinning enamel may signal an eating disorder&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent enamel erosion, especially on the inside surfaces of the teeth, may indicate frequent exposure to stomach acid. This can happen in conditions involving self-induced vomiting, where stomach acid repeatedly reaches the mouth and gradually erodes enamel. As enamel wears away, teeth become thin, weak, sensitive and more prone to chipping. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6831-14-92?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the journal BMC Oral Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, people who engage in self-induced vomiting show significantly higher enamel erosion, particularly on the inner tooth surfaces, due to repeated stomach acid exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Essential dental tips for healthier teeth and gums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with restrictive eating patterns may also lack essential nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D, which are needed to maintain strong teeth. While tooth erosion alone cannot diagnose an eating disorder, it is often one of the earliest visible signs and may prompt a dentist to recommend medical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pale or whitish gums can indicate possible anaemia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy gums should look pink and firm. If gums appear unusually pale, whitish or almost translucent, it may indicate a lack of healthy red blood cells, a condition known as anaemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen, people can experience fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath. Anaemia caused by deficiencies such as iron, vitamin B12 or folate often shows subtle oral signs before other symptoms become noticeable. Although gum colour alone cannot confirm a diagnosis, it may encourage a dental professional to advise a blood test. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in iron, B12, and folate, along with regular dental check-ups, can help prevent anaemia and support overall oral and systemic health effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loose teeth or bone loss around teeth may be a sign of osteoporosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis weakens bones throughout the body, and the jawbone is no exception. The jawbone supports teeth, and when bone density decreases, teeth may become loose, gums may recede, and gaps may develop. Dentists may notice changes during routine X-rays, sometimes before fractures or other symptoms appear elsewhere in the body. Osteoporosis is more common as people age and in those with low calcium intake, hormonal changes or sedentary lifestyles. While tooth loss can have many causes, unexplained loosening of teeth may indicate reduced bone density and the need for further medical assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent gum inflammation may point to kidney disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidney disease affects the body’s ability to filter waste and can weaken the immune system. People with reduced kidney function often experience dry mouth, changes in taste and increased inflammation. This inflamed environment encourages bacteria to grow, increasing the risk of gum disease. Gum inflammation may cause bleeding, swelling and eventually tooth loss if untreated. Studies suggest a two-way relationship: gum disease may worsen kidney health by allowing bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Regular dental check-ups can help manage symptoms and reduce complications for those with kidney concerns. Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential, as brushing twice daily, flossing and using an antibacterial mouthwash can reduce harmful bacteria. Managing blood pressure, diabetes and hydration also supports both gum and kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;White patches in the mouth may indicate oral thrush or immune issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;White, creamy patches on the tongue, inner cheeks or palate may indicate oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of candida. Thrush can develop when the immune system is suppressed, such as in individuals with diabetes, respiratory illnesses, long-term antibiotic use or compromised immunity. It may cause discomfort, burning sensations and difficulty swallowing. Because oral thrush can sometimes signal underlying immune changes, persistent symptoms should be assessed by a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tooth enamel erosion can be caused by acid reflux&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic acid reflux brings stomach acid into contact with the mouth, especially during night-time episodes. Frequent exposure dissolves the protective enamel layer, particularly on the back surfaces of teeth. Over time, teeth may become sensitive to hot or cold foods, change colour or develop small pits and notches. Severe erosion can alter the bite and make teeth more prone to cracking. Dentists can often spot the early signs during routine examinations, making it easier to identify reflux even before someone recognises digestive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Neglecting oral hygiene can signal cognitive decline&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decline in consistent oral hygiene, especially in individuals who previously maintained excellent dental care, may be an early sign of cognitive or memory decline. Forgetting routine brushing, skipping dental check-ups or allowing food debris to build up can signal difficulty with daily self-care. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10150074/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, adults with greater tooth loss had a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia, suggesting that oral health and brain health are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Grinding teeth during sleep may be linked to sleep apnoea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaw clenching or grinding during sleep, known as bruxism, can indicate disrupted breathing patterns. Research suggests that a significant number of people with obstructive sleep apnoea also grind their teeth at night. Teeth may appear worn down, flattened or chipped, and people may wake with jaw pain or morning headaches. Sleep apnoea is a serious condition linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, so recognising grinding as a potential clue can lead to important early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwg992q005jmemby174a0le@published"&gt;About eight years ago, Grant decided he would never vaccinate his dogs again. A former Army medic, the Santa Barbara, California, resident had always given his pets whatever the veterinarian recommended, including shots for rabies and parvo. But after training as a bodyworker and practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine, he started to question the utility of the preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxh001h3b78mcr8slo8@published"&gt;Influenced by the tenets of TCM and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/books/experiments-in-deceit.html"&gt;a book he read&lt;/a&gt; on the unethical practices of rabies vaccine pioneer Louis Pasteur, Grant became skeptical that the collection of symptoms identified by veterinarians as &lt;em&gt;rabies&lt;/em&gt; was an actual, distinct disease that could be targeted by an injectable drug. Though he distrusts pharmaceutical products, potential adverse effects aren’t his major objection to the shots. “It’s more about not being convinced at all that there’s really anything to vaccinate &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001i3b78ezluwayf@published"&gt;Though health authorities adamantly agree that rabies is a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies"&gt;real virus&lt;/a&gt;, Grant is far from alone in his skepticism about vaccines. In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23010150"&gt;2023 survey&lt;/a&gt; of American dog owners published in the journal Vaccine, 30 percent deemed dog vaccines medically unnecessary, 22 percent called them ineffective, and 37 percent worried that they could cause autism in their pets. A small majority expressed at least one of these three positions, exhibiting what the researchers called a &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/nearly-half-of-dog-owners-are-hesitant-to-vaccinate-their-pets/"&gt;concerning degree&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001j3b78uf2enypr@published"&gt;Studies and anecdotal reports have documented vaccine skepticism among pet owners around the world for years. In 2017, a &lt;a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/not-a-shot-anti-vax-movement-prompts-brooklynites-to-withhold-inoculations-from-their-pets-vets-say/"&gt;Brooklyn Paper article&lt;/a&gt; declared that veterinarians in the New York borough were hearing clients express concerns about routine shots. According to &lt;a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/7420/2019-paw-report_downloadable.pdf"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from an animal welfare organization in the U.K., just 66 percent of cat, dog, and rabbit owners said in 2019 that their pet was vaccinated while young, compared to 84 percent in 2016. Veterinarians &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-03-01/vaccine-hesitancy"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine-hesitant pet owners have good intentions and only want their pets to be well; the American Veterinary Medical Association, which did not return a request for comment, has published &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/vaccine-hesitancy-gives-some-us-dog-cat-owners-cold-feet"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; for vets who must promote vaccination to skeptical clients.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001k3b78dszbvxbm@published"&gt;But opposition to pet vaccines seems to have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that since contemporary pet owners view their animal companions as family members, attitudes toward veterinary treatments &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/04/30/veterinarians-want-you-to-know-vaccines-will-not-give-your-dog-autism/"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; attitudes toward human medical interventions. The Vaccine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journal study found that people with negative views of human vaccines were likelier to have negative opinions of animal vaccines—and COVID-19 had a lasting impact on the way people feel about preventative shots. In a series of Gallup polls, the percentage of Americans who said it was extremely or very important for parents to vaccinate their children &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;dropped 15 points&lt;/a&gt; between 2020 and 2024, a decline the poll attributed almost entirely to right-leaning Americans. A survey conducted in Brazil found that pet owners were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016758772300257X"&gt;six times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to refrain from vaccinating their animals if they themselves were not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001l3b78e173rzpt@published"&gt;Anti-vaccine advocates save their strongest rebukes for mRNA pet vaccines, the first of which were approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/blog/2024/06/25/usda-approval-nobivac-nxt-civ/"&gt;canine influenza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/blog/2024/09/24/usda-approval-nobivac-nxt-felv/"&gt;feline leukemia&lt;/a&gt; last year. The menu of veterinary mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.aaha.org/trends-magazine/publications/rna-vaccines-the-way-of-the-future/"&gt;may soon expand&lt;/a&gt;; in Canada, pets can already get one for rabies. Because the two most famous and effective COVID-19 vaccines—Pfizer’s and Moderna’s—were the first-ever mRNA products to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, mRNA technology has become a primary villain of the anti-vaccine movement in both human and animal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001m3b78e7u09p3r@published"&gt;Just as the alleged connection between human vaccines and autism has been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/"&gt;thoroughly, repeatedly debunked&lt;/a&gt;, there is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/europe/britain-dogs-autism-vaccine.html"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that pet vaccines are responsible for the ills with which anti-vaccine advocates credit them, from early-onset cancers to a suite of cognitive and behavioral problems that some half-jokingly call “pawtism.” Like autism in humans, “pawtism” is allegedly characterized by repetitive behaviors, sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and difficulty in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001n3b78350zjtqx@published"&gt;The lack of scientific backing for these vaccine concerns hasn’t stopped a multitude of influencers, care providers, and activists from raising alarm about veterinary shots. There are peddlers of tonics that claim to heal pets from the effects of “&lt;a href="https://shoprawdogfood.rawdogfoodandco.com/products/detox-bundle"&gt;toxic preventatives and pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;.” There are podcasters trumpeting “&lt;a href="https://angelaardolino.com/over-vaccination-with-dr-jeff-grognet/"&gt;the risks of over-vaccination&lt;/a&gt;.” There are social media personalities posting scary videos about pet vaccines “&lt;a href="https://x.com/ValerieAnne1970/status/1956627314965348531"&gt;shedding&lt;/a&gt;” onto humans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001o3b788imudhey@published"&gt;Among conventional veterinarians, there is no recognized diagnosis of animal autism. But some alternative practitioners insist that it is a real condition, sometimes caused by vaccines. Caroline Wilkinson, a dog trainer in the U.K., said she first learned about the possibility through the teachings of a holistic veterinarian. (Wilkinson is not a veterinarian.) She became convinced that it was a real phenomenon after seeing an increase in “fear-based behaviors” among puppies after their first shots, which she claims to have reversed with essential oil therapy. “It could be argued that these fear-based behaviors came as part of the developmental stages of puppyhood,” she said—but the speed with which the puppies recovered “indicates to me that the chemical load of the vaccine was responsible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001p3b78gd3p9rv4@published"&gt;Many of the people and organizations decrying pet vaccines are the same ones fueling skepticism of human vaccines. Children’s Health Defense, a prominent anti-vaccine advocacy group founded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Miracles-Everywhere-Unorthodox-Veterinary/dp/1510782028?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; last year about “the dangers of over-vaccination” in veterinary medicine. &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1915450267170201852"&gt;A recent video&lt;/a&gt; posted by the organization featured holistic veterinarian &lt;a href="https://ahavet.com/"&gt;Judy Jasek&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed that the “toxicity” of vaccines is causing cancer in young pets. “We know they’re not testing this stuff,” she said in the video, calling the vaccine manufacturers “the same big pharmaceutical companies that are doing their shenanigans with people.” (While shots can, on &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/vaccines-and-sarcomas-concern-cat-owners"&gt;rare occasions&lt;/a&gt;, cause tumors at the injection site in cats, there is no evidence that vaccines are responsible for other types of pet cancers.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001q3b78ixlbah59@published"&gt;Jasek, who sees clients via telemedicine from her base in Tennessee, told me she started her career as a conventional veterinarian. About a decade into her practice, she began having doubts that the vaccines she delivered to animals were safe or necessary. Her suspicions were not based on any available medical literature. “Is there a formal, quote-unquote ‘research study’? No,” she said in an interview. “Nobody’s going to do research that shows that vaccines are toxic and bad, because there’s so much money made in the vaccine industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001r3b78wwsuinsh@published"&gt;Instead, Jasek drew her conclusions from her own observations and discussions with other “holistically-minded” colleagues. She decided to transition to a different kind of veterinary practice, replacing pharmaceutical products with herbs and homeopathic remedies. She counseled her clients on vaccinating their pets less, if at all. But “rabies is really hard to get around, because of the laws,” she said. The rabies vaccine is legally required for domestic canines in &lt;a href="https://www.animallaw.info/content/rabies-vaccination-and-exemption-laws-dogs"&gt;most U.S. states&lt;/a&gt;, including Colorado, where Jasek was practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001s3b789vdjdzq3@published"&gt;Like more than a dozen other states, Colorado offered a loophole for medical exemptions. If she could argue that a pet was not healthy in any way, Jasek would write up a note excusing the animal from the rabies vaccine. Most of the time it worked fine, but she says she was twice contacted by the state board because people had filed complaints against her. (The complaints never led to any disciplinary proceedings.) Once, it was another veterinarian who didn’t believe an exemption was justified. Another time, a client’s unvaccinated dog bit someone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001u3b78s6dxm8a0@published"&gt;Rabies outbreaks in wildlife populations are &lt;a href="https://beaconbio.org/en/report/?reportid=228441a4-540b-4c15-84ec-ec8df7c569cd&amp;amp;eventid=1a182de8-04e5-450c-8d66-5dc49010b31e"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S., due in part to human incursion on natural habitats. Though the people who have died from rabies exposure in the last year have gotten the disease from wild animals, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rabies-outbreaks-rising-us-deaths-vaccine-rcna227771"&gt;veterinarians worry&lt;/a&gt; that distrust of pet vaccinations could lead to a resurgence among domestic animals of a virus that is nearly 100 percent fatal in both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001v3b78v07jx8eg@published"&gt;People whose pets aren’t vaccinated for rabies may have difficulty finding a groomer or a place to board their dogs and cats, and they won’t be able to take international flights with their pets. Grant can’t license his dogs, as Santa Barbara regulations require, because one has never been vaccinated and the other hasn’t had one since his initial puppy shots. (For this reason, Grant requested a pseudonym as a condition of our interview.) “As a practitioner myself, boy, it would sure be nice if local and state and federal governments would force people by law to consume my product,” he said. Rabies vaccine mandates are “kind of the definition of fascism, where government and corporations have merged, and now it’s claimed that it’s science—it’s scientific, so therefore it’s public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxn001w3b78ounvny4o@published"&gt;Grant does not take his beloved dogs to a veterinarian. He handles their medical care himself, using natural products and bodywork techniques. Recently, hoping to rid Grant’s dog Pilgrim (also a pseudonym) of a flea problem, a family member gave Pilgrim a pharmaceutical flea medication. According to Grant, the drug knocked Pilgrim out for the better part of four days. Grant massaged the muscles around his vital organs, which seemed to help Pilgrim regain the ability to stand up and urinate. As for the fleas, Grant will stick to using natural shampoos and brushing Pilgrim more often, even if it’s a partial, temporary fix. And he’ll take his chances without vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

But is that actually scientific? Is it actually possible?” Grant said. “We have to accept, to an extent, that life isn’t &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;perfect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Alexandria health officials are warning residents of the Rosemont area to stay cautious after a fox encountered a dog and a person in separate incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fox “came into contact” with other on Nov. 9; but it is unclear if either the dog or person was bit or hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging anyone that may have been exposed to the fox to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, an exposure to a rabid fox means that a person or animal is either scratched or bitten by a fox,” Eve Elliott, spokesperson for the Alexandria Health Department, told WTOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department offered few other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said the fox was “put down” and tested positive for rabies, a viral disease that’s spread through saliva due to a bite or scratch from an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dog’s owners and the person have been contacted by the health department, Elliott said, “and we’re taking any safe next steps to make sure that they don’t get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said rabies is endemic to Virginia: “It’s not tremendously uncommon that we have these rabies exposures in Virginia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/alexandria/2025/08/fox-tests-positive-for-rabies-in-alexandria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a rabid fox came into contact with a cat&lt;/a&gt; in the Rosemont/Del Ray area of Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so, so important that you are keeping your dogs and cats up to date on their vaccines. That way, in case there is an exposure to a rabid animal, your dogs and your cats are safe,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies symptoms in animals can include sudden aggression, drooling or foaming at the mouth or an unsteady gait. Elliot reminded people not to feed or approach stray or wild animals and keep pets on leash when in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said if you see animals who seem to have any of those symptoms, you should call animal control immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are worried that you or a family member may have been exposed to rabies, Elliott said you should contact your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3pyzb7001w26oz4vo59xk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfegob700023b6n0j205utw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfegob700043b6nrrnjwufl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhxwvtwr00003b6qop8n1dny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhxxc5fz00093b6qex3df5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3pznud00003b6n8uxk68kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhm86fwe00113b6nrykigm0w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800153b6nqzonah2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800133b6na7eu54c9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800143b6ny1qprdwz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800163b6np1jmo6b6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjb8dd00023b6qsuibg7ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhm6yj4100023b6n3969q4u6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800173b6njapt2xvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qac5v00063b6n73xxa5i9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001h3b6nis2ltt0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001i3b6ngvuqwv70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001j3b6n43x8fosz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001k3b6ngiz2o6p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001l3b6nxwjjk34v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001m3b6ny3typaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001n3b6nhzpimao9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qbimm000j3b6n436cd5ji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjguc200043b6qp601qigc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001p3b6nc4sb2hyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmho929ev00023b6qecsf4qy2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001q3b6n3dxc8p5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nusbaum points to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190962225001264?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001s3b6nie54a9qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001t3b6nmpmufrmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001u3b6nhw6nnfvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3ri5800003b6n4z2afhst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3xvho00053b6n1ie1b1or@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3uwwl00033b6nkm2kqnau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw41f5v000b3b6nc0jdlvri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qj4id00243b6ni62w3cr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000b3b6n97pdu453@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfj30lc00003b6qj1yjwct0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjky3n00063b6qe9nfa7zm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000d3b6n6n4pezr9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000e3b6neore5j4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000f3b6n5fihs5ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000g3b6n8nu9po42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjsg7v000c3b6q2zoxa01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000h3b6ni4qm1e4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physicians cannot diagnose people they have not treated, but STAT asked a leading neurologist to consider the question: Why might a 79-year-old man need an MRI scan of his brain?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons, each related to different types of brain disorders. Let’s begin by looking at the statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memory complaints are by far the most common reason that one would need a brain MRI. The &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association 2025 Facts and Figures report&lt;/a&gt; notes that 13.2% of individuals ages 75-84 years have Alzheimer’s dementia, with the percentage increasing with age: The percentage jumps to 33.4% of people 85 and older. Dementia means that an individual’s cognition — their thinking and memory — has declined to the point that it interferes with day-to-day function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before one’s thinking and memory have declined to the point that they interfere with function, cognition may still be impaired, leading to daily tasks requiring more effort and taking longer to complete. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment, and it can be detected when people undergo cognitive testing, which is generally performed by a neuropsychologist. Its &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1136393-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; is 14.8% in those ages 75-79, and 25.2% in those aged 80-84. Adding the mild cognitive impairment prevalence (14.8%) to that of the dementia prevalence for 75- to 84-year-olds (13.2%), we have a prevalence of 28% for a 79-year-old to have either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s dementia. Thus, more than one-quarter of 79-year-olds have cognitive impairment, which would lead them to get a brain MRI as part of their workup. Alzheimer’s can be diagnosed with increased certainty if a blood, spinal fluid, or amyloid PET scan biomarker is positive.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage include mild memory problems such as needing reminders, overly relying on GPS/phone apps to navigate even in familiar environments, misplacing and losing things more than before, word-finding difficulties, and trouble performing complicated tasks such as learning how to use a new software package, website, phone app, or board game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the cause of mild cognitive impairment and dementia approximately 60% of the time in people over the age of 75. But there are many other causes of dementia as well. Two disorders often mimic Alzheimer’s disease. Both have nice acronyms due to their long names. PART (primary age-related tauopathy) occurs in just about everyone who lives into their 80s or beyond. PART is believed to be one of the causes of “age-related” memory loss in individuals who do not have dementia, and so it is a large cause of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LATE (limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy) is common cause of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in people over the age of 75. Although many people haven’t heard of LATE, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6536849/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt; it is generally the third most common pathology observed in the brain, after Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cerebrovascular disease — also known as strokes — these are incredibly common and become more common as individuals age, such that the risk of stroke roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5321635/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; every decade after age 55. So, an individual aged 79 has more than five times the risk of stroke as someone who is 55 years old. Risk factors for strokes in addition to age include heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet (particularly with ultra-processed foods), and excessive alcohol. Most 79-year-olds have at least some tiny “mini-strokes” that are observable on an MRI scan. If one has many of these mini-strokes, they can cause mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Strokes can be seen on an MRI scan, which is the imaging study of choice to make the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of vascular mild cognitive impairment are similar to but not the same as those seen in Alzheimer’s disease, and include difficulty in or taking longer to do tasks, such as keeping information “in one’s head”; doing mental arithmetic like calculating the tip in a restaurant; following a route in one’s mind; figuring out how to use a software package, website, phone app, or board game; and finding words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last common cause of dementia is due to Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies, which are small clumps of protein inside brain cells that damage and then destroy them, are known for causing Parkinson’s disease, but they can cause mild cognitive impairment and dementia as well. When Parkinson’s disease starts first, we generally use the terms “Parkinson’s disease mild cognitive impairment” and “Parkinson’s disease dementia.” If the cognitive disorder starts first, we use the terms “mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies” and “dementia with Lewy bodies.” The core features of these disorders include cognitive impairment, signs of Parkinsonism, fluctuations in attention and alertness, acting out dreams while sleeping, and hallucinations (usually visual). Note that people don’t need to have all these symptoms to be diagnosed with a Lewy body disease. There are now spinal fluid and skin biopsy tests to diagnosis Lewy body diseases.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are other reasons besides strokes and memory problems that a 79-year-old man might need an MRI scan. These include collections of fluid that can accumulate in between the brain and the skull, such as a subdural hematoma. Falls, especially if they include hitting one’s head, can cause subdural hematomas and other types of brain bleeding. Other reasons to get a brain MRI are persistent dizziness or trouble walking, either of which can lead to a fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An MRI is also needed if one has a seizure, which occurs in approximate a dozen people out of every thousand who are age 79. Sometimes a headache is bad enough or persistent enough or unusual enough that one should get an MRI scan to rule out a brain bleed or brain tumor. Lastly, if someone has hearing loss in one ear it could also be due to a brain tumor, so that’s another reason to get an MRI scan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, there are many reasons why a 79-year-old man might need to get an MRI scan. Some reasons are relatively benign, such as a headache or hearing loss, and others are more worrisome, such as signs of stroke or memory loss. Many would require ongoing monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

For 2025, the theme centres on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://worlddiabetesday.org/"&gt;“World Diabetes Day 2025: Diabetes and the workplace”,&lt;/a&gt; underlining the importance of health and well-being across all stages of life, including the professional sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, while many of us know the classic symptoms of diabetes, such as excess thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss, some signs are more subtle, especially in women. But what about the lesser-known symptoms that often go unnoticed until complications have already taken hold?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, especially on World Diabetes Day, it is vital that women understand these hidden alarms — symptoms that may seem benign or be dismissed as stress, ageing, or hormonal fluctuation but could signal the beginnings of Type 2 Diabetes (or worsened control). Because women have unique risks (such as pregnancy, hormonal shifts, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or PCOS, and vascular changes), it’s crucial to recognise lesser-known symptoms that often get brushed off as “just fatigue” or “just stress”. For many women, these hidden signals may mean early warning of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes before more serious complications set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do these signs need extra attention? Because, early recognition can pave the way for timely screening, lifestyle adjustments, and better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:02:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>1型与2型糖尿病：风险更高，以及如何预防严重并发症-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes-which-is-riskier-and-how-to-prevent-serious-complications/articleshow/125295140.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how the body regulates blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is the main source of energy for cells, and its uptake depends on insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. When insulin production is insufficient or the body cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels. Persistently elevated blood sugar can damage vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, causing serious long-term complications. According to the World Health Organisation, millions of people worldwide live with diabetes, and its prevalence continues to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the types, causes, and risks of diabetes is crucial for effective prevention and management, empowering individuals to make lifestyle choices that reduce complications and support overall long term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the two main types of diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is primarily classified into two main types: Type 1 and Type 2. Both types affect blood sugar regulation but have different causes, onset, progression, and management strategies, as well as varying impacts on long-term health, complications, and daily lifestyle requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in little or no insulin production. It often develops in childhood or adolescence but can also appear in adults. People with Type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Symptoms typically appear suddenly and include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;is far more common and usually develops later in life. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include being overweight, physical inactivity, older age, family history, and certain ethnic backgrounds. Symptoms often develop gradually, which may delay diagnosis. Left unmanaged, Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, vision impairment, and nerve problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1 vs Type 2 diabetes: Which is more risky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes carry serious health risks, but the nature and timing of these risks differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;can cause immediate and life-threatening complications if insulin therapy is missed. One of the most critical short-term risks is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a condition where the body starts breaking down fats for energy, producing toxic ketones that can be fatal if untreated. Managing Type 1 diabetes requires careful daily insulin administration, blood sugar monitoring, and attention to diet and physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;develops more gradually, and the risks accumulate silently over time. Chronic high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks, kidney disease, vision loss, and neuropathy. Early lifestyle interventions such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are essential to delay or prevent Type 2 diabetes progression. Medications and insulin may also be required if lifestyle changes alone are insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Prevention and risk reduction tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 Diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper management with insulin therapy is essential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular monitoring of blood sugar helps maintain control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy eating and consistent physical activity support overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular medical check-ups detect complications early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 Diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a healthy body weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage in regular physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow a balanced and nutritious diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid tobacco use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor blood sugar levels regularly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screen for prediabetes and intervene early to prevent progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood pressure and cholesterol to reduce risk of complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;General management for both types:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adhere to prescribed medications and insulin therapy if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritise lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and stress management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek education and professional support for effective disease management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistency in daily routines ensures better glycaemic control and long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is based on publicly available health information.

For 2025, the theme centres on “Diabetes across life stages” — meaning that from childhood to older age, every person has the opportunity to act to reduce risk, improve care and safeguard well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful ways to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes is by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/facts-about-sugar-and-sugar-substitutes"&gt;lowering added sugar intake&lt;/a&gt;. High sugar consumption contributes to weight gain, insulin resistance, and metabolic stress — key pathways to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11233937/"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those in sugary drinks, desserts, and processed snacks, raise blood glucose levels rapidly, promote weight gain, and worsen insulin resistance. But by choosing sweeteners that are more natural, less refined, and lower in glycaemic load, you can ease the metabolic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: you don’t have to give up sweet tastes entirely — you just have to embrace better and healthier alternatives. This World Diabetes Day, we explore seven natural alternative sweeteners that can help replace refined sugar — offering better blood-sugar support, lower glycaemic impact, and a more diabetes-friendly approach to sweetness. Let’s dive into how to skip the sugar — and sweeten more healthily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 05:20:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家识别驱动焦虑的神经元–以及如何平息它们- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-neurons-driving-anxiety-and-how-to-calm-them</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are the world's most common type of mental health condition, impacting the lives of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anxiety-disorders"&gt;360 million people&lt;/a&gt;. But what if there was a way to reverse anxiety's effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By 'rebalancing' just a few neurons in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala"&gt;the amygdala&lt;/a&gt; – a part of the brain responsible for decision-making, recall, and managing emotions —&lt;/span&gt; researchers from the Spanish National Research Council and the Miguel Hernández University of Elche (CSIC-UMH) in Spain removed anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="181430" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and social deficits in mice, returning their typical behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rebalancing was done via a gene called &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt;, which has an important role in brain messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When overexpressed, &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt; increases the production of a protein called Gluk4, which triggers anxiety-like behaviors. Mice with more of the GluK4 protein tend to avoid open spaces, aren't as comfortable socializing, and show signs of depression, for example. They also have trouble recognizing objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hangxiety-if-you-feel-anxious-after-drinking-this-is-why"&gt;'Hangxiety': If You Feel Anxious After Drinking, This Is Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using gene editing techniques to cut out extra copies of the &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt; gene, the researchers reduced GluK4 in mice, eliminating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/its-not-all-in-your-mind-a-psychiatrist-explains-what-fear-does-to-your-body"&gt;signs of anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, depression, and social issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That simple adjustment was enough to reverse anxiety-related and social deficit behaviors, which is remarkable," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251104013004.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Álvaro García.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181433" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnxiety.jpg" alt="Anxiety cell tweak" class="wp-image-181433 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnxiety.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnxiety-600x595.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181433" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers dampened &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt; activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) part of the brain.

When these neurons were returned to a standard state, the mice's behavior returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated mice still struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/memory-problems-are-surging-in-adults-under-40-large-us-study-finds"&gt;object recognition memory tasks&lt;/a&gt; in subsequent tests, suggesting that other parts of the brain affected by anxiety disorders weren't corrected by the dampened expression of &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already knew the amygdala was involved in anxiety and fear, but now we've identified a specific population of neurons whose imbalanced activity alone is sufficient to trigger pathological behaviors," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251104013004.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Juan Merma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same treatment was also successful when applied to non-engineered mice with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-developed-a-blood-test-for-anxiety"&gt;higher anxiety levels&lt;/a&gt;, further demonstrating the crucial role localized parts of the brain have in anxiety disorders, and how these circuits could be rebalanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the same processes are yet to be observed in the human brain, mice are considered good scientific stand-ins, hinting at new treatments that could help calm our own overexcited, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/roots-of-your-anxiety-may-trace-back-to-a-time-before-you-were-born"&gt;anxious brains&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;One of the world's most common viral infections could underlie virtually every case of lupus, according to a recent study providing the strongest evidence yet for a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by scientists at Stanford University, has found that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein%E2%80%93Barr_virus"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; (EBV) could be the trigger behind the '&lt;a href="https://www.lupus.org/understanding-lupus"&gt;cruel mystery&lt;/a&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBV is the pathogen that causes 'kissing disease' (or &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mononucleosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350328"&gt;mononucleosis&lt;/a&gt;), and according to the new findings, it can directly infect and reprogram specific immune cells, potentially driving the onset of the chronic autoimmune disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/root-cause-of-lupus-found-in-a-tug-of-war-over-a-critical-white-cell"&gt;systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/a&gt; – better known as simply lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the single most impactful finding to emerge from my lab in my entire career," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/11/lupus-epstein-barr.html"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; immunologist and head of the lab William Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it applies to 100 percent of lupus cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lupus-tracked-to-changes-in-a-single-gene-that-tames-the-immune-system"&gt;Lupus Tracked to Changes in a Single Gene That Tames The Immune System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of adults in the world have been exposed to EBV at some point in their lives, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="181302" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; causing little to no fuss as it lies latent in their body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with lupus, however, show a deeper infection, possibly because they acquired a more virulent EBV strain. Among patients with the autoimmune condition, researchers found the percentage of B cells infected with EBV is about 1 in 400. That's 25 times higher than in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the infection flicked a switch in B cells, activating a system that 'turns on' their pro-inflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has the potential, "to promote systemic disease–driving autoimmune responses," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, led by immunologist Shady Younis from Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181325" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-642x393.png" alt="EBV B cell" class="wp-image-181325 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-642x393.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-1102x675.png 1102w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-768x470.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-600x368.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181325" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;EBV sequencing enabled identification of EBV-infected B cells in the blood of those with and without lupus.

Med&lt;/em&gt;., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could help solve the long-standing mystery of what triggers lupus in the first place and why its symptoms go through seemingly random cycles of flaring and settling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lupus causes the immune system to mistakenly attack the body's own healthy tissues, causing widespread inflammation throughout the body with potentially severe, life-threatening outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was first mentioned in historical records &lt;a href="https://lupus.bmj.com/content/7/Suppl_1/A3.1"&gt;way back in 850 CE&lt;/a&gt;, and yet to this day, there is no known cause or cure. Only in the 19th century did experts officially recognize and describe lupus, which can cause a rash resembling a wolf's bite (hence the historical Latin name).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enduring mystery of lupus is often pinned down to its complex nature, possibly triggered by &lt;a href="https://www.lupus.org/resources/what-causes-lupus"&gt;numerous interacting factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as nutrient deficiencies, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-lupus-causing-gene-provides-a-potential-target-for-better-treatments"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal issues, or infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research from Stanford suggests there really may be a unifying explanation – one with viral origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, researchers have suspected that EBV is linked to lupus. The virus is known to infect B cells, and B-cell activity is known to be imbalanced in those with lupus. The trouble is, EBV is hard to measure when it infects and hides out in B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford devised a clever way to find which of these white blood cells are infected with the virus. Using their new sequencing technique, the team demonstrated that people with lupus have significantly more EBV-infected B cells than those without lupus, especially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"&gt;memory B cells&lt;/a&gt;, which enable rapid immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181324" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-642x642.avif" alt="Memory B Cells Comic" class="wp-image-181324 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-642x642.avif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-675x675.avif 675w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-768x768.avif 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-600x600.avif 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2.avif 802w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181324" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Memory B cells 'remember' specific pathogens so they can launch quick immune responses.

But in clinical practice, an increasingly large group of individuals with perfectly normal reports are turning out to be at high risk. It is this early stage, informally termed ‘pre-pre-diabetes’, where metabolic dysfunction begins long before any rise in glucose levels. It is not a recognized diagnostic category as yet, but it reflects a real phenomenon that doctors are now seeing routinely: the body is fighting to keep glucose stable, and on the surface, it succeeds, but underneath, insulin pathways are already failing. Here's everything we need to know as explained by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Saptarshi Bhattacharya, senior consultant, endocrinology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is just your body's warning bell, he added, saying the pancreas is working extra hard at this stage. Your glucose levels appear normal only because your body is secreting extra insulin to compensate. Yet this struggle doesn't show up in routine tests, and so many people falsely believe they're healthy. During this phase, fasting insulin rises, visceral fat builds up, triglycerides may spike, and inflammation starts to simmer-but your glucose readings remain within limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The outward picture looks normal, yet metabolically, the body's already stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Metabolic Syndrome &amp;amp; Obesity: What You Need to Know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch of normal blood glucose but underlying dysfunction is driven by genetics, high-carb diets, long sitting, physical inactivity, and poor sleep. A person can have good HbA1c but still carry significant internal risk. Many people with normal glucose profiles struggle with constant fatigue, post-meal sleepiness, sugar cravings, belly fat, frequent mood dips, skin darkening around the neck (acanthosis nigricans), or struggling to lose weight. Usually, these symptoms get ignored as a part of routine tiredness or lifestyle issues, which in many cases can be the early signs of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now perceived that insulin resistance is the fundamental engine that drives metabolic syndrome, PCOS, fatty liver, prediabetes, and eventually Type 2 diabetes. When insulin stays high for years, cells stop responding to it, and to compensate, the pancreas releases even more. This silent cycle keeps getting stretched. By the time blood glucose levels finally start rising, the process has already been going on for eight to ten years. This is why young Indians in their twenties and thirties, with a normal BMI, are increasingly getting diagnosed with fatty liver and metabolic syndrome when they have no abnormal glucose level readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors now recommend a deeper look for anyone with a family history of diabetes, weight issues, PCOS, thyroid concerns, sedentary jobs or chronic stress. Glucose parameters in prediabetes range, minor changes in lipid profile, elevated liver enzymes, high-sensitivity CRP, and fatty liver on ultrasound should not be ignored and may reflect early signs of internal metabolic derangement. Even simple measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio or a body composition scan may uncover high visceral fat behind an outwardly slim frame. If we test glucose levels alone, we miss the full story. But if we assess insulin and inflammation early, we can prevent diabetes before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most promising part is that pre-diabetes is reversible with consistent lifestyle changes. Prioritizing protein in every meal, upping greens and fibre, cutting back on refined carbs and packaged foods, and choosing millets, dals, nuts, and healthier fats help stabilize insulin. Strength training is often ignored, but the biggest user of glucose is muscle tissue, and so building muscle mass can, therefore, greatly improve insulin sensitivity. The regular movement counts, too; even a short 10–15-minute walk after meals will reduce glucose spikes and thereby reduce insulin demand. Better sleep, stress control techniques, hydration, and reduction of late-night eating further strengthen metabolic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal blood glucose levels do not automatically mean normal metabolic health. Prediabetes is the stage where we can make the biggest impact. If we catch insulin resistance early and correct it, we can avoid future diabetes rather than just manage it later. In a country with rising lifestyle diseases, understanding this early, hidden phase may be one of the most powerful tools in changing long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 03:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我几乎不能走路-影响五分之一妈妈的问题- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxk3w9277o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;'I could hardly walk' - the issue that affects one in five mums&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3db/live/126fd750-ba68-11f0-ba8c-5f7067df6bdc.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Rebecca Middleton A woman with blonde hair and glasses smiling with a young boy with blonde hair wearing a blue top.

By this point I couldn't do any of them. It was too painful," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It got to the point where even sitting became uncomfortable for Victoria, and she was largely homebound until her baby was born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The pain lessened after the birth of her daughter, but she began experiencing the same problem when she became pregnant with her second child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's not an option for many mothers, but Victoria said given her medical history she decided to pay for a private physio as the NHS wait for referral was long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The physio gave her a full assessment and hands-on treatment including joint mobilisation, and taught her different ways to move her body to not aggravate her hip joints, which helped ease the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Victoria still struggles with a degree of PGP today, four years on, but her second pregnancy was much easier to manage because she understood her condition and how to handle it.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rebecca's second pregnancy has been similarly a much more positive experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This time round she knew she was at risk of PGP and was able to have it treated throughout her pregnancy before it became debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She has made a full recovery from PGP, just two months post birth compared to  two years for her first child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm probably in better shape now than I was before either of my children because I now know what caused that pelvic girdle pain, and have had it fully treated and resolved with manual therapy," she says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It was five years of hell because of the pain I was in because of a lack of knowledge and understanding about the subject."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="links-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="links-title" class="sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW"&gt;Other stories you may enjoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:21:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1VNTJVNGh4QWJXaF9CQmRpOFExM3lNcmJqdldsTmowTk9DMFZEM1FmRGliOTBlaFZ3aFNud0FwSXRFcUZ4enhHNGoxTi0xdkpfQlhhcnJnZzlkUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9MRHRUY2NDRk5zRFpjSnFhSlR6ZHZHbC1hVlBySmphemRTTWZLeUFBTXVjRHhmdWV5bHJzaEJRSkpTbUZWRzlYRk9XcDBzTTVPenBtRm4yS2l0cUZGWHBR</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿州禽流感的初步病例将是美国9个月来的第一例- abcnews.go.com</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/preliminary-case-bird-flu-washington-state-uss-9-127506791</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Health officials in Washington state say they have identified the nation's first human case of bird flu since February, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza"&gt;pending confirmatory testing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A Grays Harbor County, Washington, resident preliminarily tested positive for the infection, the Washington State Department of Health said Thursday.

However, in about half of these donations after circulatory death (DCD) cases, the transplant ends up being cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That is because the time between the removal of life support and death must not exceed 45 minutes. If the donor does not die within the timeframe needed to preserve organ quality, surgeons often reject the liver because of the increased risk of complications to the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now doctors, scientists and researchers at Stanford University have developed a machine learning model that predicts whether a donor is likely to die within the timeframe during which their organs are viable for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The AI tool outperformed the judgment of top surgeons and reduced the rate of futile procurements – which occur when transplant preparations have begun but the donor dies too late – by 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By identifying when an organ is likely to be useful before any preparations for surgery have started, this model could make the transplant process more efficient,” said Dr Kazunari Sasaki, a clinical professor of abdominal transplantation and senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It also has the potential to allow more candidates who need an organ transplant to receive one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Details of the breakthrough were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00100-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the Lancet Digital Health journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advance could reduce the number of instances in which healthcare workers prepare organs for recovery, only to determine they are unsuitable for recovery and transplantation, putting financial and operational strain on transplant centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hospitals primarily rely on surgeons’ judgment to estimate this critical timeframe, which can vary widely and lead to unnecessary costs and wasted resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new AI tool was trained on data from more than 2,000 donors across several US transplant centres. It uses neurological, respiratory and circulatory data to predict a potential donor’s progression to death with greater accuracy than previous models and human experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

&lt;p&gt;“While mismatched vaccines may still provide protection, enhanced genetic, antigenic and epidemiological (eg, vaccine effectiveness) monitoring are warranted to inform risk assessment and response,” Skowronski and colleagues concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the UK Health Security Agency published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025"&gt;preliminary study&lt;/a&gt; finding that, despite the mismatch, this year’s shot still seems to provide important protection. The study found that soon after vaccination, the vaccine provided 70 to 75 percent protection against hospitalization in children aged 2 to 17 years, and 30 to 40 percent protection from hospitalization in adults. These protection levels are within the typical range for flu vaccines, but they’re more often seen at the end of a season—when vaccine protection has waned some—rather than early in the season, soon after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, officials called the results “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;reassuring&lt;/a&gt;.” In particular, officials noted the strong numbers in children, which parents can tell you, have the ability to be superspreaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The high vaccine effectiveness in children strengthens the case for ensuring all eligible young people get vaccinated,” Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at UKHSA, said. “When more children are protected, it helps stop the spread of flu to others around them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that it’s looking possible that we may be facing a very bad flu season this year, and the best thing we can all do right now to tackle the problem is to get vaccinated,” Adam Finn, professor of Paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s unclear how flu vaccinations are going in the US this season, at the end of last season, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-coverage.html"&gt;about 47 percent of adults&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;49 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; had received vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

But according to science, one factor in particular acts as the foundation for all the others: “Nutrition is the number one factor, the starting point that underpins the rest,” explains Stanford University epigenetics expert &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/lucia-aronica" target="_blank"&gt;Lucia Aronica&lt;/a&gt;, whose research focuses on nutriepigenetics, or the way “food can influence gene expression and how it can turn on or silence certain genes related to aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is epigenetics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how our &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/healthy-habit-tips" target="_blank"&gt;habits&lt;/a&gt; influence &lt;em&gt;our genes&lt;/em&gt;—and more specifically, how what we eat activates genes that promote cell repair or, on the contrary, accelerate their deterioration—Aronica shares this metaphor: “Think of your genes as the hardware of a computer and epigenetics as the software. You can’t change the hardware, but you can reprogram the software with your daily decisions: what you eat, how you move, how you handle stress. For example, sleeping activates the parasympathetic system and allows cellular repair. Without rest, the skin simply cannot recover. Those kinds of daily decisions, like prioritizing rest or taking care of your diet, make all the difference; that’s why two twins can have completely different skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best foods to eat for healthy skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that our diets would play a major part in the way our skin ages. For example, we know that the nutrients in food support functions that contribute to healthy, glowing skin: the vitamin A in carrots, the vitamin C in oranges, the omega 3 fatty acids in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sardines-protein-and-beauty-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;sardines&lt;/a&gt;. But do those foods also help turn on the genes that promote cellular repair as opposed to diminishing it? Aronica outlines a few categories of foods to rely on in order to keep skin looking youthful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are essential for the synthesis of collagen, keratin, and elastin. “Without enough &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, the skin cannot repair and regenerate itself,” Aronica notes. In addition, certain proteins, like eggs, fish, legumes, and poultry, contain nutrients called methyl donors—such as methionine, folate or betaine—also function as small epigenetic switches. “They act by turning on or off genes involved in the regeneration and aging processes. That’s why both the quantity and quality of the protein matter,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Colorful vegetables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aronica is a big proponent of what she calls &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/eat-rainbow" target="_blank"&gt;eating the rainbow&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve probably all heard about the importance of eating vegetables of all colors, but what many people don’t know is that those plant pigments—also known as phytonutrients—also influence gene expression. Each color acts on different genes: Red foods, such as tomatoes and peppers, contain lycopene, an antioxidant that acts as an internal sunscreen. Orange foods, like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/carrot-salad-skin" target="_blank"&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt; and pumpkin, are rich in carotenoids that provide luminosity and elasticity. Green vegetables, such as broccoli, arugula, or spinach help detox; and blue or purple ones, such as blueberries, are anti-inflammatory,” says Aronica. “Cruciferous vegetables, such as &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/broccoli-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt;, cabbage, or arugula, are some of my favorite foods for the skin: They help activate antioxidant and detoxification genes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods that age the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum are foods that accelerate aging. The biggest culprit? &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/too-much-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;Sugar&lt;/a&gt;. Aronica says there are three main reasons why the sweet stuff is no good: “First, because it binds to proteins, including collagen, and ‘caramelizes’ them, forming compounds called Advanced Glycation End Products, or AGEs, that age the skin from the inside. Second, because it promotes &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/inflammatory-foods-to-avoid" target="_blank"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which accelerates cell damage. And third, because it alters the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-foods-for-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, affecting the balance of bacteria that also influence the skin. That’s why too much sugar, especially in the form of refined or white sugar, is so harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what about the sugar in fruit? “If it comes from the whole fruit, there’s no problem,” Aronica clarifies. “Fiber modulates its absorption and provides protective phytonutrients. The problem arises with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/is-juice-healthy" target="_blank"&gt;fruit juices&lt;/a&gt; or excessive consumption, because the sugar is absorbed too quickly and the beneficial effect of the fiber is lost. Drinking orange juice is not the same as eating an orange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applying epigenetics to beauty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science of epigenetics also carries over into the world of cosmetics. “Today there are ingredients that act as topical nutrients,” Aronica explains. “After years of research, compounds have been identified that are capable of reactivating genes that tend to shut down with age. The future lies in combining internal nutrition with good habits and external care, and thus influencing the skin from the inside and from the outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of what that means in practical terms, Aronica sees us moving towards a more personalized wellness model, where each person will be able to “reprogram” his or her own genetic software through their habits. “More and more people will understand that food is not only energy, but a tool to modulate gene expression and slow down aging,” she says, adding that she foresees genetic testing making it more possible for people to fine-tune their diets and lifestyles to meet their unique needs. “There are people who need more choline or more methyl donors, and if they don’t get them, their epigenetic mechanisms don’t work properly,” she says. “The future of wellness will consist of identifying these differences and adapting the diet in a personalized way. For living longer, yes, but above all, also living better. Because true longevity is not about adding years to life, but life to years with health, energy, and wellness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 23:22:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBpazBTd1Bja2hzdzBNNFRBem1QbkVWNS1BTUQ4ZXJBV2h4NUhMcjdWSkoyOUJoano0aXdhdHZScHJXeWRYdEh0VVd5al9Lc1ZtZHVCX2p4RkZTTU1DYlJMWG15Uk5QWnBENnZn</guid></item><item><title>科学家通过重置“流氓”细胞探索自身免疫性疾病治疗的新前沿- PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/scientists-explore-new-frontier-in-autoimmune-disease-treatment-by-resetting-rogue-cells</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases — by reprogramming patients’ out-of-whack immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your body’s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today’s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don’t fix what’s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects — and too often the drugs aren’t enough to keep their disease in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-live-the-winner-of-the-nobel-prize-in-medicine-is-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Nobel Prize in medicine awarded to 3 scientists for their study of the immune system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re entering a new era,” said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who’s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer “the chance to control disease in a way we’ve never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who’ve exhausted today’s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the heck is wrong with my body?” Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn’t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital’s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, “I’m going to trust you.” Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can actually run, I can chase my kid,” said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. “I had forgotten what it was to be me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;‘Living drugs’ reset rogue immune systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas — immune cells called B cells — go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she’s been in remission — with no other medicine — since March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma — and few relapses so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those early results were “shocking,” Hopkins’ Konig recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient’s blood and sent to a lab, where they’re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those “living drugs” are infused back into the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can’t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they’re healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Other ways to reprogram rogue cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach uses “peacekeeper” cells at the center of this year’s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don’t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body’s existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen’s Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Grieshaber-Bouyer reported giving a course of one such drug, teclistamab, to 10 patients with a variety of diseases including Sjögren’s, myositis and systemic sclerosis. All but one improved significantly and six went into drug-free remission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Next-generation precision options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins’ Konig aims to get more precise, targeting “only that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B cells have identifiers, like biological barcodes, showing they can produce faulty antibodies, Konig said. Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark “bad” B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Green’s lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It’s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells — and they’re outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green’s team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune “generals” to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they’d “divide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,” Green said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will know it’s working if that galaxy-like map shows less red and more yellow. Studies in people are still a few years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Could you predict autoimmune diseases — and delay or prevent them?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drug for Type 1 diabetes “is forging the path,” said Dr. Kevin Deane at the University of Colorado Anshutz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he’s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On all these fronts, there’s a tremendous amount of research left to do — and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T’s safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma — and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just remember I woke up one day and thought, ‘Oh my god, I don’t feel sick anymore,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of result has researchers optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never been closer to getting to — and we don’t like to say it — a potential cure,” said Hopkins’ Konig. “I think the next 10 years will dramatically change our field forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

The research shows that boosting levels of a molecule called NAD+ corrects errors in the way brain cells process genetic information, leading to improved memory and function. The paper detailing this mechanism was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ady9811" target="_blank"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the gradual loss of brain cells, resulting in cognitive decline. One of the main culprits in this process is a protein called tau. In healthy neurons, tau helps maintain their internal structure, acting much like railroad ties that keep tracks stable for transporting cellular materials. In Alzheimer’s disease, tau proteins can become defective and clump together, causing this internal transport system to collapse and leading to cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research indicated that a metabolite known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD+, could offer some protection in animal models of the disease. NAD+ is essential for energy production and maintaining the health of cells, particularly neurons. Its levels are known to decline with age and in several neurodegenerative diseases. While supplementing with precursors to NAD+ showed promise, the specific way it protected the brain remained largely unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work was conducted by an international team led by Evandro Fei Fang at the University of Oslo in Norway, in collaboration with Oscar Junhong Luo from Jinan University in China and Joana M. Silva from the University of Minho in Portugal. The scientists wanted to understand the molecular steps behind NAD+’s protective effects. They focused on a fundamental cellular process called alternative RNA splicing, which has recently been recognized as a contributor to Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows a single gene to produce multiple distinct versions of a protein, known as isoforms. By selectively including or excluding different segments of the genetic blueprint, a cell can create proteins with varied functions from the same gene. When this finely tuned process is disrupted, as it appears to be in Alzheimer’s, it can lead to the production of faulty proteins and cellular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the link between NAD+, tau, and RNA splicing, the researchers used several models. They began with a species of roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, that was genetically modified to produce the toxic form of human tau protein. Using a fluorescent reporter system, they could visually track splicing errors inside the worms’ neurons. They observed that worms with toxic tau had significant disruptions in their RNA splicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then moved to a mouse model genetically engineered to develop tau-related brain pathology. These mice exhibit memory problems similar to those seen in human Alzheimer’s patients. The researchers provided some of these mice with nicotinamide riboside, a precursor that the body uses to make NAD+. After several months of treatment, they analyzed the animals’ brain tissue and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the mice with tau pathology had widespread errors in RNA splicing within their hippocampal cells, a brain region vital for memory. In the mice that received the NAD+ precursor, many of these splicing mistakes were corrected. This molecular repair was accompanied by functional improvements. The treated mice performed better on memory tests, suggesting that restoring proper RNA splicing helped recover cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A specific protein, named EVA1C, emerged as a central player in this recovery. The researchers found that in the tau-affected mice, the benefits of the NAD+ precursor disappeared when the gene for EVA1C was turned off. This result indicated that EVA1C is necessary for NAD+ to exert its neuroprotective effects on RNA splicing. Consistent with these findings, an examination of brain tissue from people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease showed significantly reduced levels of EVA1C in their neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how EVA1C works at a molecular level, the team used an advanced artificial intelligence platform. The platform analyzed vast amounts of protein data to predict the three-dimensional structures of different EVA1C isoforms and how they would interact with other proteins. This computational analysis predicted that boosting NAD+ promotes a specific version of the EVA1C protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular isoform of EVA1C was predicted to bind with high affinity to other essential proteins, including one called HSP70. HSP70 functions as a “molecular chaperone,” helping other proteins fold correctly and clearing away damaged or aggregated proteins. By influencing which isoform of EVA1C is produced, NAD+ appears to enhance the cell’s protein management system, which is critically impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. The research connects cellular metabolism, through NAD+, with the genetic processing of RNA splicing and the physical management of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is not without its limitations. The findings are based on animal models, and the complex pathology of Alzheimer’s in humans may involve additional factors. Future research will need to confirm these mechanisms in human cells, perhaps using brain organoids grown in the lab, and to further map the precise chain of events connecting NAD+ to the cell’s splicing machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the work opens new avenues for therapeutic development. By identifying the connection between NAD+ and EVA1C-regulated RNA splicing, the study provides a clearer target for potential treatments. “We propose that maintaining NAD⁺ levels could help preserve neuronal identity and delay cognitive decline, paving the way for combination treatments to enhance RNA splicing,” says Ruixue Ai, a first author of the study. This research deepens the understanding of how NAD+ supports brain health and may inform the design of more effective strategies to combat neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ady9811" target="_blank"&gt;NAD+ reverses Alzheimer’s neurological deficits via regulating differential alternative RNA splicing of EVA1C&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Ruixue Ai, Lipeng Mao, Xurui Jin, Carlos Campos-Marques, Shi-qi Zhang, Junping Pan, Maria Jose Lagartos-Donate, Shu-Qin Cao, Beatriz Barros-Santos, Rita Nóbrega-Martins, Filippos Katsaitis, Guang Yang, Chenglong Xie, Xiongbin Kang, Pingjie Wang, Manuele Novello, Yang Hu, Linda Hildegard Bergersen, Jon Storm-Mathisen, Hidehito Kuroyanagi, Beatriz Escobar-Doncel, Noemí Villaseca González, Farrukh Abbas Chaudhry, Zeyuan Wang, Qiang Zhang, Guang Lu, Ioannis Sotiropoulos, Zhangming Niu, Guobing Chen, Rajeevkumar Raveendran Nair, Joana Margarida Silva, Oscar Junhong Luo, and Evandro Fei Fang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 23:02:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOTUxGQ18zWWlUQm9GSThOemJsaEpNRlR4UldDVkdzcTViRXJCY3dET2xkYXRwQlZTQnBNeEp2RkROVkdwMVFjSGNTUDR0NzFhVVVyMFdvU0s2c1FaTHVpVEFqMi11ZVhvdWthN3RvQmdfallpY1hqWGduV0lzN2VVZzhlMXlrVFVzRDJiRkZhN2pIUQ</guid></item><item><title>猪器官移植经常被拒绝—研究人员找到一种方法来阻止它-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03750-w</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03750-w/d41586-025-03750-w_51706648.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03750-w/d41586-025-03750-w_51706648.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A crowded operating room with a doctor wearing white scrubs preparing a pig kidney for transplant." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03750-w/d41586-025-03750-w_51706648.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Robert Montgomery prepares a pig kidney for transplant into a brain-dead man in New York in July 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Shelby Lum/AP via Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have successfully stopped a pig kidney from being rejected by its human recipient. The organ survived for 61 days in the recipient, a 57-year-old brain-dead man in the United States, the longest a genetically modified pig organ has survived in a brain-dead person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two papers&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; today, researchers describe the main factors that cause the human immune system to reject transplanted organs. Researchers say the findings will improve outcomes for living people who receive organs from other people, or from animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my mind, this is the first evidence of how to reverse rejection,” says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a clinician researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who led the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04185-3/index.html#section-X6su349JZz" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04185-3/index.html#section-X6su349JZz" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;first pig-heart transplant&lt;/a&gt; into a living person in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past three years, around a dozen living people have received organs from genetically modified pigs, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00111-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00111-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00368-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00368-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01613-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01613-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;livers&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;thymus&lt;/a&gt;. But most of these organs were eventually removed after losing function or no longer providing enough benefit to justify the immunosuppression treatment required. Other recipients died shortly after the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the pig kidney, the male recipient also received the pig’s thymus, a small gland that taught the man’s immune system to recognize the pig’s cells as part of the body. The thymus probably played a big role in helping the pig organ survive for longer, says co-author of the studies, Robert Montgomery, a surgeon and researcher at the New York University Langone Transplant Institute in New York City. In past experiments with non-human primates, he says, the modified kidney survived better when transplanted with the thymus than without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding rejection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest pig-organ transplant was performed on 14 July 2023 at New York University Langone in New York City. The kidney and thymus were taken from a pig supplied by Revivicor, a subsidiary of biotechnology firm United Therapeutics, based in Virginia. The pigs had a single genetic modification, removing gene GGAT1, to stop the production of a sugar called alpha-gal on cells. Alpha-gal has been found to cause organ rejection in transplant surgeries in non-human primates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the transplant, the kidney appeared healthy and produced urine. But 33 days after the procedure, the kidney’s function suddenly declined, and a biopsy showed that the organ was being rejected and damaged by antibodies. The team replaced the person’s plasma and gave them steroids and a drug called pegcetacoplan, which stopped pig cells being tagged for destruction by the immune system. But on day 49, another biopsy showed a different type of rejection, in which inflammatory cells had infiltrated the kidney’s surface. This was treated with an immunosuppressant that destroys T cells and stopped the organ from being rejected. Kidney function was also fully restored. The research team chose to end the experiment at 61 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune system investigation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They are currently receiving treatment in King County, following previous care in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are investigating potential sources of the infection, including contact with wild or domestic birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the preliminary positive test, public health disease experts have not identified any risk to the general public. The Washington State Department of Health is collaborating with local health departments and healthcare facilities to support the ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza, colloquially called bird flu, is caused by the influenza type A virus and naturally occurs in wild aquatic birds. It can infect other bird species and occasionally mammals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases are rare and typically mild, with symptoms such as conjunctivitis, fever, and respiratory issues. Most human infections have been linked to exposure to sick or infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently considers the risk to the public from avian influenza to be low. However, people who work with or have recreational contact with potentially infected animals are advised to take precautions, including wearing personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are monitoring anyone who has been in close contact with the patient to ensure that human-to-human transmission is not occurring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of avian influenza increases in the fall and winter due to migratory birds spreading the virus to domestic animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with backyard poultry should avoid contact with sick or dead birds and report any illness to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Veterinarians are urged to report suspected cases in domestic animals or livestock. Additionally, the public is advised to avoid handling sick or dead wildlife and to report such cases to the Washington State Department of Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of simultaneous infection with human and avian influenza viruses, it is recommended that individuals, especially those exposed to sick birds, receive a seasonal flu vaccine. The vaccine is advised for everyone six months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 21:48:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAJBVV95cUxPbUFBRmt4aFZlNGpXbUd1YWZQT2VDdG5WdGxLdHVzcmhCOEwyU2s2NjEtZ3R4d1RpMlBnVld0aTdmLWtDVTUzcjhiVTRfTlNuMlVDYmJYREl6bFJlelFZMV9NOFdpSTVPb1V4cjVCNEp0UEQ4bGp6Nk9JWDlqUUZxWjFKNE40X1REemRZRlhncUlMdldKRXE3amtzdzhmR2x5SVJpUGUtbjBoWExnRUR2T0tpcXpIVDRuOTV5UmhPWGp5SVFJeXlZc0hIME1jTE5fN1pPamktQ3pFWVFUSmhGNkNRNWFaS3k2RS11R1pQZDYzQWJMUFRUdTNzTFVmZXFjZ0poOV9BWmRqOVNOTDJjUEtuVi1rV2x1eUZPdTh2Sjh6MkhEeDhtN29QN1RScFkza0pWbUZZMHhKeGNiWEQ5dTJMRmxtNFQtVkpwTg</guid></item><item><title>微小的芯片搭乘免疫细胞到达炎症部位- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/tiny-chips-hitch-a-ride-on-immune-cells-to-sites-of-inflammation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          
&lt;p&gt;Standard brain implants use electrodes that penetrate the gray matter to stimulate and record the activity of neurons. These typically need to be put in place via a surgical procedure. To go around that need, a team of researchers led by Deblina Sarkar, an electrical engineer and MIT assistant professor, developed microscopic electronic devices hybridized with living cells. Those cells can be injected into the circulatory system with a standard syringe and will travel the bloodstream before implanting themselves in target brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the first two years of working on this technology at MIT, we’ve got 35 grant proposals rejected in a row,” Sarkar says. “Comments we got from the reviewers were that our idea was very impactful, but it was impossible.” She acknowledges that the proposal sounded like something you can find in science fiction novels. But after more than six years of research, she and her colleagues have pulled it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nanobot problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when Sarkar and her colleagues gathered initial data and got some promising results with their cell-electronics hybrids, the team proposed the project for the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award. For the first time, after 35 rejections, it made it through peer review. “We got the highest impact score ever,” Sarkar says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for that score was that her technology solved three extremely difficult problems. The first, obviously, was making functional electronic devices smaller than cells that can circulate in our blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous explorations, which had not seen a lot of success, relied on putting magnetic particles inside the bloodstream and then guiding them with magnetic fields,” Sarkar explains. “But there is a difference between electronics and particles.” Electronics made using CMOS technology (which we use for making computer processors) can generate electrical power from incoming light in the same way as photovoltaics, as well as perform computations necessary for more intelligent applications like sensing. Particles, on the other hand, can only be used to stimulate cells to an extent.&lt;/p&gt;

The technology could allow doctors to administer small amounts of drugs to specific sites, avoiding the toxic side effects of body-wide therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microrobots — guided by magnetic fields — work in blood vessels in pigs and sheep, researchers showed in a paper published in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; on 13 November&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system has yet to be trialled in people, but it shows promise because it works in a roughly human-sized body, and because all its components have already been shown to be biocompatible, says Bradley Nelson, a mechanical engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, who co-led the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one-third of developed drugs that fail to come to market do so because they’re too toxic&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, says Nelson. The team says the microrobots would allow smaller amounts of drugs to be given directly to the affected areas, thereby reducing potential side effects. The technique could be used to target stroke-causing blockages or brain tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demonstrations are compelling but still preclinical,” says Wei Gao, a medical engineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, whose team has developed an alternative robotic drug-delivery system. But if further studies proceed smoothly, remote-controlled drug-delivery robots could be used in the first medical applications within five to ten years, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03754-6/d41586-025-03754-6_51706798.gif?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03754-6/d41586-025-03754-6_51706798.gif?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A looping animated sequence showing an insertion catheter with a gripper arm releasing a microrobot into a clear demonstration replica of a human vein." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03754-6/d41586-025-03754-6_51706798.gif"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: ETH Zürich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Robot-delivered drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have explored how to use &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03480-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03480-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;tiny robots to deliver drugs for decades&lt;/a&gt;, including by steering them using ultrasound and using rotating devices that mimic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system developed by the ETH team involves filling a tiny bead of gelatine with a drug, as well as nanoparticles of magnetic iron oxide, which allows its movement to be controlled by magnetic fields surrounding the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trials in the brains of pigs and sheep, the team showed that they could use a catheter to insert the bots, before making them roll along the edges of blood vessels, swim against the flow or navigate with the stream at speeds as fast as 40 centimetres per second. They used X-ray images to observe and manoeuvre the bots in real time with millimetre-precision. In trials in pigs, the team showed that in more than 95% of cases, the drugs were delivered to the correct location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever of unidentified cause in Ethiopia have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to dispatch a team of responders and deliver medical supplies to the southern part of the country, near its border with South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/ethiopia-suspected-viral-haemorrhagic-fever-outbreak"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today, WHO Africa said that Ethiopian health authorities are ramping up their response and conducting lab tests to identify the cause of the infection and stop further transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement," the WHO wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia's Health Ministry will likely announce the results of the ongoing investigation tomorrow, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/13/ethiopia-viral-hemorrhagic-fever-outbreak-who/22aa9f7e-c0a3-11f0-8eee-a78486b4c797_story.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;media reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provision of personal protective equipment, financial aid&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO is providing essential supplies such as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, infection-prevention materials, and a rapidly deployable isolation tent to improve clinical care and boost management capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization has also released $300,000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support and is marshaling technical capacity to support the response.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral hemorrhagic fevers, a group of epidemic-prone diseases caused by several distinct families of viruses, include Marburg, Ebola, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms vary by virus, but initially they often include high fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, weakness, and exhaustion. All cases, whether single or in clusters, should be immediately reported to health authorities without waiting for identification of the causative pathogen, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
