Simple carbs include food items like white bread, pastries, and sugary drinks. When eaten, these break down quickly into glucose, thus causing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. However, when we have complex carbs-- like whole grains, legumes, and vegetables-- they are digested slowly due to their high fiber content. And so, they slowly release glucose, thus providing steady energy, preventing sudden sugar spikes, and improving insulin sensitivity over time.

Perhaps a kind friend could have suggested to Bi that there were other explanations. Instead, Bi had a set of legal adversaries and a supportive echo chamber. On Facebook, GCs and IPs alike expressed sympathy for Bi’s tragic posts: Everyone knew bad surrogates existed, and based on Bi’s claims, it sounded like Smith was one. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a Bay Area fertility doctor and influencer, called Smith “a criminal” and “a psycho.” Bi’s $1,275-an-hour lawyer, Elizabeth Sperling, wondered whether digging through social media posts might show Smith engaging in “strenuous activity” that could explain the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bi’s husband focused on stabilizing the family, a move he credits with saving their marriage. He blamed the hospital, not Smith, but told me that the litigation is “her grieving process.” He tried to stay out of the legal stuff so that Bi couldn’t blame him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Smith had planned&lt;/span&gt; to go back to work shortly after giving birth. Instead, she couldn’t stop bleeding. Even though SAI had determined she hadn’t breached the contract, the escrow stopped paying, leaving Smith reliant on disability benefits as she faced an increasing pile of terrifying bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When Smith was finally cleared to return to work, a month after Leon died, Bi emailed Smith’s HR department to ask about her health plan. Bi also reported Smith to a federal agency, claiming that Smith was committing fraud. The stress on Smith was already high: Her supervisor at work had found her crying on and off for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Smith hadn’t heard from Bi since her terse reply to the condolence email. Then, Bi texted her a screenshot of a Facebook post about another GC who’d had an abruption at almost 32 weeks—but that GC had called 911 and the baby had lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Next, Bi iMessaged a photo of Leon’s corpse to Smith’s 7-year-old son’s iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;In the months&lt;/span&gt; after Leon died, Bi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Called the FBI 12 times. Reported Smith, SAI, the hospital, and Clarity escrow to more than a dozen state and federal regulators and numerous professional organizations. Launched a new round of her $30 million venture fund, backed by Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, President Trump’s “AI and crypto czar,” on Leon’s due date. Posted Leon’s ChatGPT-written endorsement from heaven, offering his “eternal blessings” for her work. Created TikToks, Instagram Reels, Facebook posts, X threads, LinkedIn Updates, and a website for her advocacy. Posted links disclosing Smith’s full name, photo, address, employer, mortgage license number, and son’s first name to her website. Asked her husband, again and again, how it was possible that Smith had carried her son but felt “nothing” about his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe hyVpEN callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby Leon’s empty crib.&lt;/p&gt;

She got on lithium for her bipolar disorder in early 2021 and began looking for surrogates as soon as she stopped feeling “sedated.” I spoke to the therapist Bi hired to consult with her and Valdeiglesias. She told me that, of the 792 intended parents she has evaluated for surrogacy or gamete donation in the last decade, she has declined to recommend only about a dozen. “I’m not gatekeeping,” she said. When it comes to serious mental illness, she added, it’s up to them to disclose. One of Bi’s fertility doctors, meanwhile, told me it’s not his place to scrutinize intended parents. He defers to the recommendation of the psychological interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If an intended parent gets turned down, they can usually find another therapist, another clinic, another agency. But without anyone questioning her plans, Bi seemed betrayed by the challenges of third-party reproduction. “Surrogacy is supposed to be the safest route,” she wrote on Instagram. It wasn’t just Leon’s death that pushed Bi into her spiral of legal action and social media posts. It was the apparent lack of control of having her child inside another woman’s body—the most basic fact of surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNU3FOeG1jSkVJTFBtXzR6U3FmeUp1UlRnVEpzM0VHeUlxbEpaVjVQQ1Y5VEN6eERXME1BQlppVS1XazRJd1o3dWFzUGEtNWxLbnZuaWlaTXp6YVJkb0F6b19xOXJ3c3pYVzB6MFlDZ2hBTnBNX0ZmdmpiUW5IZU9OU0YxdXRpc2M</guid></item><item><title>根据物理治疗师的说法，每个人在70岁后都应该做的6项基本运动，以增强力量和行动能力-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/here-are-the-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-after-turning-70-according-to-a-physical-therapist</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f"&gt;If you’re looking for exercises to improve your strength, balance, mobility, and function as you get older, you’ve come to the right place. As we age, strengthening the muscles in our body is more important than ever — strength training is one of the most effective ways to prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass. It can also help build stronger bones and improve your balance and stability, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a complete beginner or are returning to exercise following a long break, the good news is that things don’t have to be overly complicated. In fact, just using your bodyweight and performing a few simple exercises a few times a week can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f-2"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr Nancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist who specializes in exercises for older adults, and in a video posted to her social media accounts, she shares the six exercises she prescribes to patients between 70 and 90 years old. All of the exercises can be completed from home, and all you’ll need is a can of food from your cupboard, a chair, and a tea towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises focus on the lower body, but you’ll still be working your core muscles if you do them correctly.

Here’s how to do them with good form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-lateral-step-over" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-lateral-step-over"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Lateral step over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="443f71f4-d1bc-44e4-9d5f-d9d5a3bc0ccf"&gt;For this exercise, use a can of food from the cupboard and place it on the floor. Step to one side of the can, and stand tall, engaging your core with your hands on your hips. Lift one leg and step over the can laterally, then follow with your other foot. Then, repeat the move, stepping back to the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-box-squats" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-box-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Box squats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="83cd6595-3a1b-4b5f-a9d9-02508c9de23a"&gt;For this exercise, place a box on top of a chair. Ensure the chair is sturdy and doesn’t have wheels. Squat down, bending at your knees and keeping your core engaged until your glutes touch the box, then push down through your feet to return to a standing position, squeezing your glutes at the top. As you get stronger, make the box lower to the chair, then remove it entirely. To make the exercise easier, extend your arms away from the body. To make it harder, place your hands on your hips. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-standing-hip-extension" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-standing-hip-extension"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Standing hip extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c413bab-30f5-4b5a-ab7e-1294638f3ea9"&gt;For this exercise, stand facing a wall and place both hands on the wall for support. Shift your bodyweight into one leg, and straighten the other leg, keeping your foot flexed, before taking the leg back and lifting it a few inches off the floor. Keep kicking back for 10 reps, then switch onto the other leg. Aim for three sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-single-leg-slides" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-single-leg-slides"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Single leg slides &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="988f05a3-3742-41c1-965c-853097326459"&gt;For this exercise, you’ll need to grab a tea towel. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, and engage your core. Place one foot on a tea towel, and keeping a slight bend in both knees, slide the leg out to the side, then bring it back in, then slide it back behind you, moving slowly and with control. Keep the rest of your body still — it should only be the one leg that is moving. Complete 10 reps, then switch to work on the other leg. Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-standing-hip-flexion" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-hip-flexion"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Standing hip flexion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="c39987cf-4116-4193-94b0-a2a32356fac6"&gt;Standing facing a wall, place both hands on the wall for support. From here, engage your core and lift one leg off the ground, keeping a 90-degree bend in your knee to march your leg up towards your torso. Place the leg back on the floor, and repeat on the other side. Keep alternating sides. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-6-lateral-toe-taps" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-lateral-toe-taps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Lateral toe taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f83bd91-41e0-4166-8164-df7a56faf5d2"&gt;For this exercise, start with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. Place your hands on your hips. From here, lift one leg off the floor, point your toe, and tap the leg out to the side of your body. Return to your starting position, and repeat on the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9e3ca6d5-f2f2-4f35-9bfd-900f60099211"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e47481eb-b462-4ccb-b677-9d3f09f76f41"&gt;To make this workout easier, drop the number of sets — start by completing one, and work your way up. To make it harder, increase the difficulty of the exercises by increasing your range of motion — remove the box on the chair during the squats, or the size of the step in the lateral step overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exercise will work the muscles in your lower body as well as your core, and test your balance and stability. A lot of the exercises will work one side of the body at a time, and you might notice the exercises are easier on one side. This is normal, and working on your weaker side can help correct any imbalances in the body, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

You’re feeling sick, we get sick, too. Just maneuver through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His father taught him that a husband provides, a wife takes care of children. Emotional equity wasn’t built in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brokenforbetter/?hl=en" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; had survived infidelity and rebuilt their lives as marriage coaches. They lived through the death of their teenage son in a car accident and became grief leaders. But when Schaer watched his wife Denette suffer from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/07/12/what-is-perimenopause-first-signs-typical-age-and-what-to-know/70311139007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that grew to sharp mood swings, forgetfulness and extreme fatigue – he couldn't bear losing the woman he’d known for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I needed to find compassion and empathy,” Schaer, 49, says. “Nothing in life I would have my wife walk through by herself. I had to figure how to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together." data-c-credit="Octavio Jones, For USA TODAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He set the thermostat in their Tampa home to 69 degrees&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; built what he calls a wind tunnel of fans above his wife’s side of the bed and bought a white noise machine to block out the irritating way his breathing sounded. He did laundry and other chores; many he admits that he should have been doing all along. He learned about hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“But most important,” he says, “I listened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Just as Gen X and millennial women are changing the way they approach perimenopause and menopause, piercing through the cultural zeitgeist, so are their husbands and partners. &lt;a href="https://mindpumppodcast.com/2582-the-strange-signs-symptoms-of-perimenopause-with-dr-mary-claire-haver/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bro fitness podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are now talking about hormones and strength training. Men are joining their wives for medical appointments, going to &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;menopause retreats&lt;/a&gt;, and making TikTok videos and &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. They are doing so with both a sense of urgency and sometimes humor. One man even named his wife’s menopause symptoms “Agnes” to remind them that it is part of his wife, but not all of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the process by which men are approaching menopause in this generation is akin to other ways they are defining masculinity. Or, at the very least, exploring how they have understood what it means to be a man. Maybe masculinity still does mean taking care of and protecting your partner, being the breadwinner and remaining stoic all the same. But just like the men who understood changing a diaper in the 1990s didn't take away their manliness, so can participating in their spouse's emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This evolution in masculinity, where vulnerability and authenticity are valued, moves away from the restrictive path in which the men interviewed by USA TODAY were raised. It’s not just changing them, but their marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Women are welcoming men to the menoconversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause shouldn’t simply be discussions in a gynecologist’s office, says &lt;a href="https://www.tamsenfadal.com/about" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tamsen Fadal&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Menopause-Charge-Health-Reclaim/dp/0306833549" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“How to Menopause.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet it was almost always relegated to the exam room, somewhere with stirrups in sight&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It's not only about the body temperature changes. There's the so-called "menobelly." The irritability or walking into a room only to forget why seconds later. Oh, and a plummeting sex drive, which almost always makes women spiral into shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This can create conflict in the relationship if you don’t bring men into it,” Fadal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=653&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1306&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.' data-c-credit="Craig Barritt, Getty Images For ADAPT Community"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are few studies on how men view menopause, but one of the most recent shows that almost three of four men now say they talk with their partner about menopause. These men also discuss treatment options, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2019/10000/the_mate_survey__men_s_perceptions_and_attitudes.6.aspx" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menopause, the Journal of the Menopause Society.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause, the time leading up to the menopause where a woman's period stops, can last up to 10 years and include a fluctuation in hormones. It can present with symptoms ranging from frozen shoulder to achy joints and often women suffer for years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These are men who grew up with fathers who ignored menopause. These are men who now are realizing their mothers went through this and they didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After all, there's a silence that had always accompanied women going through menopause. If they dared asked for help, it was about masking symptoms − and feelings − in order to please others. It was to not draw any more attention to the fact that they were aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These also are men who see that while divorce rates overall are dropping,&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/14/divorce-women-perimenopause-menopause/85622804007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; divorces among adults 50&lt;/a&gt; and older are increasing. Seven in 10 women blame perimenopause or menopause for the breakdown of their marriage, according to a survey in the United Kingdom by the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/family-law-menopause-project-newson-health-research-partner-shahzady/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Family Law Menopause Project and Newsom Health Research and Education.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Fadal helped make &lt;a href="https://themfactorfilm.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“The M Factor,”&lt;/a&gt; a documentary about menopause. When it was screened earlier this year, the majority of audiences were women. Then she noticed a shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Women were starting to bring their husbands or partners to help them understand this,” she says. “Half of the population will go through menopause, and we need the other half to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Finding his vulnerability in talking about menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theparentexpress" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Jesse Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was driving home from his sales job when he heard menopause expert &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/17/mary-claire-haver-menopause-the-m-factor/75702888007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Mary Claire Haver&lt;/a&gt; on a health podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He was astounded by how often &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/23/hormone-therapy-estrogen-perimenopause-antidepressants/85282744007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;women are misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, the misunderstandings about hormone therapy, and his own ignorance. So, he posed a question on his parenting TikTok account this summer: “Do women want husbands to talk to them about menopause?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hundreds of women told him they wanted men to learn more. The husband and father of two shifted his videos to menopause and perimenopause. He approaches it not as an expert, but someone learning along with other men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While it has grown his audience and given him a sense of pride in helping others, there’s been another more important transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It has brought him closer to his wife of 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85866080007-jesse-robertson-and-wife.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85866080007-jesse-robertson-and-wife.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Jesse Robertson says that learning more about perimenopause and menopause have brought him closer to his wife."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Jesse Robertson says that learning more about perimenopause and menopause have brought him closer to his wife." data-c-credit="Jesse Robertson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s allowed me to have more vulnerable conversations with her,” says Robertson, 47, who lives in the Minneapolis area. “If I can talk to her about this, something sensitive, personal, and kind of uncomfortable for me, we can talk about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/12/15/bell-hooks-quotes-books-love-feminism/8910938002/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bell Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, the late author and cultural critic, said that even the most loving of couples fall into the trap of avoiding emotions and projecting expectations onto the other person. It's a comfortable game, one that has furnished endless aisles of self-help books. Women are from venus. Men are from mars, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To love, she said, men and women must be willing to hear each others' truths without punishment or exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Now Robertson hears from men and couples who are watching his menopause videos together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It isn’t just women who have to go through it,” he says. “It’s something that partnerships have to go through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Men need to learn more and stop being (expletives)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Todd Maxwell was scrolling through his phone when he came across one of Robertson’s videos describing symptoms that sounded like his wife: fatigue and brain fog, frozen shoulder, and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I think this is what you might have,” he told her. “Perimenopause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She was only 40. When she told doctors, they discounted&lt;a href="/story/news/health/2024/12/04/menopause-perimenopause-the-excerpt/76758146007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; her symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the shoulder issues on exercise and the fatigue on their four children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When she had confided in Maxwell about hot flashes, he says he had made jokes about it. “It was awkward, and I didn’t know what to say,” he says. “I should have been more understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They separated this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I told her that I’m really sorry it took me this long to realize that I could have been more helpful,” says Maxwell, 47. “Men need to learn more and stop being (expletives.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Maxwell, an oil lineman, lives in a small town in Alberta, Canada. He grew up believing men don’t show emotion. Sharing how he felt, he thought, feel could only add to his wife’s burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He threw himself into being the kind of father that he never had – the kind that goes to hockey games and listens. But, he says, he didn’t put that same energy into understanding his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until now. He started therapy. He’s reading books and watching videos to learn more about perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Now if I want to talk to my wife about how I’m feeling, I write in my journal. I take a walk,” he says. “I think about her feelings, what she needs. I want to be here for her, for my daughters and my sons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Men need to understand menopause is more than mood swings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.daveymaherfitness.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dave Maher&lt;/a&gt; began training women over 40, he saw that no matter what they ate or how much they exercised, they weren’t losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85873375007-dave-maher-trainer.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=628&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Trainer Dave Maher says that treatment during menopause and perimenopause can improve health - from the brain to the heart."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Trainer Dave Maher says that treatment during menopause and perimenopause can improve health - from the brain to the heart." data-c-credit="Dave Maher"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was also about hormones and estrogen, things that change drastically during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s insulting for us to tell midlife women to just eat less and move more,” he says. “Women have been gaslit and lied to and suffered needlessly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause treatment is about health and longevity, not simply feeling better. It's about decreasing risks for &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559623/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;building strength&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of an assisted living facility. It's about the quality of the last third of a woman's life. As Maher learned more, his business shifted to helping women better understand and get treatment – from hormone therapy to nutrition – in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Men need to understand it’s not just mood swings,” says Maher, 41. “It’s the collapse of estrogen and progesterone and testosterone. Women need this to be healthy – for their hearts, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11387275/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their brains&lt;/a&gt;. Men need to wake up.

While trawling survey data on household spending to try to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes were rising&lt;/a&gt; so rapidly in his home country, he was surprised to note that people were buying smaller quantities of sugar, salt and other ingredients generally associated with these conditions than they had in previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when Monteiro and his colleagues dug deeper did they find the culprit. People were buying less sugar to prepare cakes and desserts, but eating more of it in pre-made pastries and breakfast cereal. They were buying less salt, but consuming more of it in frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets and dehydrated packet soups. “We realized the problem was our traditional dietary patterns were being replaced by foods that are processed so many times that they can no longer be recognized in the final products. We called them ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02750-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51412836.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Ultra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteiro, a nutrition and public-health researcher at the University of São Paulo, first used &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the term ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; (UPF) in a paper in 2009, arguing that people interested in promoting healthy diets should focus more on the degree, extent and purpose of processing than on nutrient profiles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was a radical idea that caught the attention of other researchers, who, over the next decade or so, published dozens of papers linking UPFs with obesity and a range of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments took notice, too. In 2014, Brazil began advising people to avoid UPFs. Other countries, including France, Belgium and Israel, followed suit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been a critic of UPFs, saying in January that they are “poisoning the American people”. In May, the US government announced plans for a research agenda to support nutrition policy and improve people’s diets, in part by improving understanding of the impacts of UPFs on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s good evidence that diets high in UPFs are associated with poor health, some scientists are sceptical that the UPF category is useful for research or as the basis for dietary advice, arguing that it is too broad and ill-defined. It makes little sense, they say, to lump together foods as diverse as shop-bought yogurts and wholegrain breads with doughnuts and potato crisps. And they wonder whether UPFs are largely linked to poor health just because they tend to be high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre and vitamins. Questions remain, but recent research findings can provide some guidance for people trying to make healthy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing diets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;humans have been processing food&lt;/a&gt; by cooking it. The fermentation, milling, salting, pickling and smoking of food also have long histories. Canning, pasteurization and the use of additives, such as artificial sweeteners and colouring agents, date back to the nineteenth century. Today, many foods undergo multiple forms of advanced processing, such as fractionation into constituent sugars, oils and fibres; hydrogenation to alter physical properties; and extrusion, which subjects ingredients to high temperature, pressure, shear forces and rapid expansion. These foods are generally classified as UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPF consumption has grown since the 1950s, initially in high-income countries and, since the 1990s, in low- and middle-income countries&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Surveys suggest that UPFs make up almost 60% of calorie intake in the United States and United Kingdom, 48% in Canada and 42% in Australia (see ‘Ultra-processed intake’). Traditional eating patterns have proved more enduring in Romania (15% of calorie intake), Italy (18%), Brazil (22%) and France (31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ULTRA-PROCESSED INTAKE.

Dozens of studies have linked diets high in UPFs with increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cancer, asthma, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published last year, for example, epidemiologist Mingyang Song and his colleagues at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data on the diets and health of more than 110,000 US adults, who were tracked over a median period of more than 30 years. Song found that those with the highest proportion of calories from UPFs were 4% more likely to die of any cause during the study than were those with the lowest intake. Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, but not from cardiovascular or respiratory disease or from cancer&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Diets that included more processed meat, poultry, seafood and sugary drinks were associated with higher risks after researchers controlled for factors such as body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption and family health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that nutritional quality could be a big factor in why diets high in UPFs might be unhealthy. The increase in risk was much lower for those with diets that, although high in UPFs, were still defined as healthy according to a diet-scoring system called the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. Those diets included a lot of vegetables and nuts, and limited the intake of sugary drinks, red and processed meats, salt and trans fats. “The association between UPF consumption and mortality was much weaker once we accounted for dietary quality,” says Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, other research indicates that nutritional composition is not the whole story. When Samuel Dicken, a clinical scientist at University College London, reviewed 37 studies that reported health outcomes linked with UPFs, he found that almost all of the associations remained after researchers controlled for nutritional composition&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken and his colleagues subsequently ran a trial in which adults who were overweight or obese were asked to follow one of two diets defined as healthy according to the UK Eatwell Guide (see &lt;a href="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go.nature.com/4fpdeen&lt;/a&gt;), and then switched to the other diet. One of the diets was made up mostly of UPFs and the other mostly of minimally processed foods, but the two diets were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;matched for levels of protein&lt;/a&gt;, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium and sugar. Participants lost twice as much weight (an average of 2 kilograms versus 1 kg) on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF diet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings, published in August, suggest that the increased prevalence of health problems linked to a UPF diet in other studies cannot be fully explained by poor nutritional composition. So what other mechanisms might be involved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond processing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken’s study is one of only a handful of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on UPFs. Unlike retrospective and observational studies, RCTs can demonstrate causal links and so might offer a clearer picture, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first RCT on UPFs was carried out by a team led by integrative physiologist Kevin Hall, who until April was at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the HHS. For more than a decade, Hall has sought to overcome some of the limitations of nutrition research by confining study participants to a research hospital, so that their diets can be precisely recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he was approached by two Brazilian researchers at a meeting after he presented the results of one such study, comparing a low-carbohydrate, animal-product-based diet with a low-fat vegan diet. “They told me they had enjoyed my talk, but that my focus on nutrients was very twentieth century and that really, I should be thinking about the extent and purpose of processing food,” says Hall, who had not then heard of UPFs. He was sceptical but intrigued enough that he devised a trial in which 20 adults stayed at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and consumed a diet high in either UPFs or unprocessed food for two weeks before swapping diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Employees in protective clothing and hard hats check hundreds of breaded chicken nugget pieces on a factory production line conveyor belt." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Breaded chicken nuggets are inspected before being packaged at a factory near Orléans in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other researchers, Hall defined UPFs using a system developed by Monteiro. Known as NOVA, it classifies food into four groups according to the extent, type and purpose of processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as vegetables and pasta, are at one end of the scale. At the other end are UPFs, which undergo multiple industrial processes and usually contain substances rarely used in home kitchens, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and additives, including colouring and emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in Hall’s RCT could eat as much as they liked, but the food presented to them was matched for nutrient groups. To Hall’s surprise, the results, published in 2019, showed that participants consumed around 500 calories more per day on average while on the UPF diet — and gained an average of 0.9 kg over the two weeks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They lost that same amount of weight while on the unprocessed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hall dug further into the results to try to understand why people on some diets, including those high in UPFs, eat more calories, he and his colleagues found that people consumed more if they ate quicker&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants also consumed more calories when the foods were energy dense (containing more calories per gram) and “hyper-palatable” — containing ingredients high in combinations of fat, carbohydrates, sugar and salt, which, some researchers say, activate reward signals and circumvent satiety mechanisms in the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Energy-dense foods provide more calories in less time than those with fewer calories per gram because they are easier to eat, and many UPFs are energy dense because their water content has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00549-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_50690036.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How a junk-food splurge can change your brain activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions remained about what might be driving the extra intake, so Hall set up another trial, this time involving 36 people who spent a week each eating a minimally processed diet and three UPF diets: one was energy dense and hyper-palatable; another was energy dense but not hyper-palatable; and the last was neither energy dense nor hyper-palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is ongoing, but early findings show that participants ate more and gained more weight while on the energy-dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet compared with the minimally processed diet. Most of the increases in consumption and body weight that occurred on the energy dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet also occurred on the energy dense diet low in hyper-palatable foods, suggesting that energy density could be the more important factor to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that eating more slowly and eating diets with low energy density are associated with lower calorie consumption — and that various factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;food texture&lt;/a&gt;, can affect eating speed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, Ciarán Forde, a nutrition researcher at Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, asked 50 adults to eat as much as they liked during four lunches. He found that they ate much less when presented with hard-textured foods, such as potato waffle fries, than when given soft-textured foods such as mashed potato, regardless of whether the foods were UPFs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “What we saw was that the speed of eating and the texture properties of meals drive consumption, not the degree of processing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forde’s team went on to ask 41 adults to follow, for 14 days, either a UPF diet consisting of foods with harder textures associated with slow eating, or a UPF diet made up of softer foods linked to faster eating, and then swap over. The meals presented were matched for energy density, and, Forde says, the energy density of foods that participants actually consumed turned out to be the same as well. Although the full results are yet to be published, participants consumed 369 fewer calories per day, on average, when their diet consisted of slowly consumed foods than when it contained those linked to faster consumption, according to initial results Forde presented at a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a combination of energy density and food texture explains why people eat more, says Forde, who has received funding from multinational food companies. “Maybe it’s not something magic in ultra-processed foods that we don’t understand. Rather it’s just about factors we’ve long known, about how foods are eaten and how they drive meal size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Malla explains that while antipsychotic medications are effective, they only go some way to addressing symptoms of disease. "Antipsychotic medication really only works for positive symptoms, which are things that should not be there, like illusions or hallucinations," says Malla. Negative symptoms are the absence of things that should be there, such as emotional expression, ability to generate thoughts and ability to relate socially to people. The reverse of which would be social withdrawal, a lack of experience, feelings and so on. "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/epa-guidance-on-assessment-of-negative-symptoms-in-schizophrenia/86280E47EC2DA56EC5F9D8B951DF698E" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Medications have very little, if any, impact on these&lt;/a&gt;," says Malla.

Homelessness is less common among people with schizophrenia in Chennai, for example. Malla puts this down to families wanting to keep mental illness within the household so that any stigma associated with having a family member with schizophrenia can be "kept under wraps". He says that marriage is a key concern for families, and anything that might affect an offspring's marriageability will be dealt with as a family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla points out that families in Canada are as interested in taking care of their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, as they are in India. But he says that the sophisticated legalisation of contact and confidentiality with patients can be a problem. A young adult in North America can more easily leave home and cut off contact if they wish, he says.

              &lt;p&gt;Normally, I’d start this sort of article by saying something along the lines of, “Everyone knows how horrible it is to feel motion sick.” But that’s not entirely true—plenty of people can text, read, and do all sorts of things in a moving vehicle without feeling the slightest bit nauseous. If that sounds like you, you’ll have to trust me—a chronic sufferer of motion sickness—when I say that it wholeheartedly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plus, many drugs used for motion sickness come with an unwanted side effect: drowsiness. While that’s useful for a long-haul red-eye, it definitely kills the mood on a road trip. That’s why researchers have looked into whether music can help people recover from carsickness, and they might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” Qizong Yue, a researcher at Southwest University in China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Simulated carsickness hell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.163610"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Yue and colleagues induced carsickness in study participants with a driving simulator (you couldn’t pay me enough to get into that) and then played different types of music while monitoring them for potential recovery. According to their results, soft and joyful music best supported recovery. Perhaps surprisingly, even sad music was worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team divided the 30 participants, who had reported moderate levels of previous carsickness, into six groups—four who listened to music as they recovered from motion sickness, one who didn’t, and one whose simulations stopped before the participant became carsick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wore &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875"&gt;electroencephalogram&lt;/a&gt; (EEG) caps—tools that measure electrical activity in the brain. The researchers hoped to identify brain signals indicative of carsickness by comparing the neural activity of the first five groups with that of the sixth group—the one for which the simulation stopped before participants could become nauseous (ok, maybe you could pay me to be in group six).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers first measured each participant’s EEG signals as they sat still in the simulator. The participants subsequently underwent a driving task and communicated their level of carsickness. At the end of the task, some participants listened to music for 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team then asked them how carsick they still were. The participants reported that joyful music reduced carsickness by 57.3%, soft music reduced it by 56.7%, and passionate music by 48.3%. While those who didn’t listen to music reported 43.3% fewer carsickness symptoms after the 60 seconds, participants who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that soft music might relax tensions that worsen carsickness, and joyful music may provide a distraction by triggering brain reward systems. Sad music could aggravate negative feelings and, as a result, worsen a person’s general discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your brain when you’re motion sick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the EEG data revealed changes in participants’ occipital lobe brain activity when they said they were carsick. Specifically, the device recorded less complex activity when participants reported feeling significantly nauseous. As they recovered, brain activity in this area gradually returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” Yue explained. “The primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, “the primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,” the researcher added. “This constraint results in limited statistical power.” What’s more, one’s brain might react differently to a simulation than real-life conditions. In other words, more research with larger samples is needed to confirm both the carsickness brain activity patterns and to continue investigating the impact of music on motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the team will study different types of motion sickness and the influence of music taste. And if any of the researchers are reading this article, I’d like to suggest investigating the anecdotal evidence of how singing helps prevent and/or recover from motion sickness. It would finally prove to my family that I literally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to belt out the lyrics to all of Taylor Swift’s songs when we hit those windy roads.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, health authorities have warned against red meat consumption, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; research arm classifying it as "probably carcinogenic to humans". But a controversial &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; challenges that position, suggesting that animal protein might protect against cancer deaths rather than cause them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)&lt;/a&gt;, part of the WHO, has long classified red meat, including beef, pork, lamb and mutton, as probably carcinogenic. And processed meats such as bacon and sausages are classified as definite carcinogens. This judgment reflects multiple studies linking red meat to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01646-1"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming the basis of dietary advice to limit intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the new research by Canada's McMaster University suggests the opposite: that people who consume more animal protein may actually have &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;lower cancer mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;. But, before you rush out to buy a pack of sausages, there are some important points you should note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methods contain important nuances that complicate its &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/eating-meat-could-protect-against-cancer-related-death-study-suggests"&gt;headline-grabbing conclusions&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than examining red meat specifically, the researchers analysed consumption of "animal protein", a broad category that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/11/1771"&gt;includes red meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. This distinction matters significantly because fish, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/640"&gt;oily varieties such as mackerel and sardines&lt;/a&gt;, are associated with being cancer-protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By grouping all animal proteins together, the study may have captured the protective effects of fish and certain dairy products rather than proving the safety of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy products themselves present a complex picture in cancer research. Some studies suggest they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322002095?via%3Dihub"&gt;reduce colorectal cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; while potentially &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/association-between-dairy-products-consumption-and-prostate-cancer-risk-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/ADBD3EA24DE6E07CE23E0F110012916C"&gt;increasing prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. This mixed evidence underscores how the broad "animal protein" category obscures important distinctions between different food types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.ncba.org/"&gt;National Cattlemen's Beef Association&lt;/a&gt;, America's primary beef industry lobbying group, contains several other limitations. Crucially, the researchers didn't distinguish between processed and unprocessed meats – a distinction that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01635580701684872"&gt;countless studies have shown to be vital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as bacon, sausages and deli meats consistently show higher cancer risks than fresh, unprocessed cuts. Additionally, the research didn't examine specific cancer types, making it impossible to determine whether the protective effects apply broadly or to particular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also examined plant proteins, including legumes, nuts and soy products such as tofu, and found they had no strong protective effect against dying of cancer. This finding contradicts previous research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-025-00688-3#Sec11"&gt;plant proteins are linked to decreased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, adding another layer of complexity to an already confusing picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don't diminish the established health benefits of plant-based foods, which provide fibre, antioxidants and other compounds associated with reduced disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg" alt="salad with numerous items" class="wp-image-151583 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study doesn't undermine the wealth of evidence that plant-based foods are good for you. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/close-up-photo-of-vegetable-salad--ftWfohtjNw"&gt;Nadine Primeau/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not a green light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the study's conclusions about animal protein prove accurate, the study shouldn't be interpreted as a green light for unlimited meat consumption. Excessive red meat intake remains linked to other serious health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/85/1-2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000224"&gt;heart disease and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The key lies in moderation and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflicting research highlights the complexity of nutrition science, where isolating the effects of individual foods proves remarkably difficult. People don't eat single nutrients in isolation – they consume complex combinations of foods as part of broader lifestyle patterns. It's more important to focus on overall dietary patterns rather than fixating on individual foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/12/1947"&gt;balanced plate approach&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a variety of protein sources, plenty of vegetables and fruits, and minimally processed foods, remains the most evidence-based path to optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this latest study adds a new dimension to the meat debate, it's unlikely to be the final word. As nutrition science continues to evolve, the most prudent approach remains the least dramatic: moderation, variety and balance in all things.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264088/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;They have been promoted as a remedy for anxiety and sleeplessness, with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlskNOvFJQW/?taken-by=myblanquil"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and influencers swearing by their calming effects. Weighted blankets – heavy throws filled with glass beads or plastic pellets – have gone from a niche therapeutic tool to a mainstream wellness must-have, promising better sleep and reduced stress for anyone struggling to unwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do they deliver on these bold claims, or are we simply paying premium prices for an expensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weighted-blankets-really-can-do-wonders-for-a-good-nights-sleep"&gt;Weighted Blankets Really Can Do Wonders For a Good Night's Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists have used weighted blankets since the 1970s to help children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and adults with sensory processing disorders. They became commercially available in the 1990s, but remained largely within special needs communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed dramatically in recent years when companies began targeting what they call the "casually anxious" – essentially, anyone struggling with modern life's stresses. The marketing worked: Time magazine even named the weighted blanket one of the &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454469/gravity-blanket/"&gt;top 50 "inventions" of 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept behind weighted blankets is appealingly simple. Typically weighing between two and 13 kilograms (experts &lt;a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/sleep/sleep-help/how-do-weighted-blankets-work/"&gt;recommend choosing one that's 10% of your body weight&lt;/a&gt;), they use what occupational therapists call "deep pressure stimulation". The gentle, even pressure across your body mimics the sensation of being held or hugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research picture is more nuanced than the marketing suggests. Several studies do show promising results, but with important qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7970589/"&gt;study of 120 psychiatric outpatients&lt;/a&gt; found that weighted blankets improved insomnia symptoms over four weeks in people with major  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded they were "a safe and effective intervention for insomnia in patients with some mental health disorders".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller studies have shown similar patterns. One found that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05"&gt;63% of adults reported lower anxiety&lt;/a&gt; after just five minutes under a weighted blanket, while another study of psychiatric inpatients found &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0164212X.2015.1066220"&gt;60% experienced reduced anxiety&lt;/a&gt; during their hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies all focused on people with diagnosed mental health conditions, not the general population that companies are now targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the science diverges from the marketing: reviews of the research consistently show that benefits for healthy people are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38686123/"&gt;much harder to prove&lt;/a&gt;. While weighted blankets may help people with clinical anxiety or sleep disorders, there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39341068/"&gt;insufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they benefit casual users without existing mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, about half the research on weighted blankets &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32204779/"&gt;doesn't meet quality standards&lt;/a&gt; for robust scientific evidence – a significant problem given the confident health claims found on product websites and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a28713038/weighted-blanket-health-benefits/"&gt;glowing reviews&lt;/a&gt; in lifestyle magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who might benefit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean weighted blankets are entirely useless for healthy people. Shift workers, who must sleep during daylight hours when their brains are naturally alert, might find them helpful for combating the known health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896"&gt;irregular schedules&lt;/a&gt;. Healthcare workers, firefighters and pilots who rely on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37061-9"&gt;strategic power naps&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from faster sleep onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect also shouldn't be dismissed. If a weighted blanket helps you feel calmer and sleep better, even if the mechanism isn't what manufacturers claim, that's still a positive outcome, provided you understand what you're buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighted blankets do carry some risks. They shouldn't be used by anyone who cannot easily move beneath their weight, including young children. People with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, sleep apnoea, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/"&gt;COPD&lt;/a&gt;, circulation problems, high blood pressure or claustrophobia should consult their GP before opting to use one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No studies have reported serious harms, but common sense suggests checking with a healthcare provider if you have underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a low-risk intervention that might complement &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10105495/"&gt;good sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/benefits-of-sleep"&gt;regular sleep cycles&lt;/a&gt;, weighted blankets aren't inherently problematic. The issue lies in overselling their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering buying one, be realistic about your expectations. You're not buying a miracle cure for modern anxiety but rather a potentially comforting sleep aid that might help you feel more settled at bedtime. For many people struggling with sleep, that gentle pressure and sense of security could be worth the investment, even if the science behind it isn't quite as solid as the marketing suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real question isn't whether weighted blankets work, but whether they work for you, and whether the premium price is justified for what might ultimately be an expensive hug.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263591/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 70-year-old woman became the first in Massachusetts to test positive for West Nile virus this year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-human-case-of-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was exposed to the disease in Middlesex County, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department did not disclose details about specifically where or when the woman was exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne virus can be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mosquitos positive for West Nile virus were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; June 17, found in Boston’s West Roxbury and Hyde Park neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/08/13/the-risk-for-west-nile-virus-is-now-high-in-10-mass-communities-heres-what-to-know/"&gt;warned residents&lt;/a&gt; in early August about the rise of the virus, declaring the risk to be “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current risk for the virus is high in 10 municipalities in Suffolk and Middlesex counties, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, there have been 319 West Nile-positive mosquito samples so far, the department said. In July, a goat in Lunenburg was the first animal to be infected with the virus in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “While September brings cooler air and the return to school for many in the state, the risk from WNV is going to be elevated for some time. Residents should continue to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites,” said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; residents to be wary of the mosquitos, and take proper precautions like applying insect repellent when outdoors, draining standing water, and installing or repairing window screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mosquitoes will be with us until the first hard frost,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine M. Brown. “People should use mosquito repellent with an EPA-registered active ingredient, clothing to reduce exposed skin, and consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-west-nile-virus-positive-mosquito-sample-0"&gt;19 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2024 and &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-risk-level-changes-for-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;six cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) may play a significant role in brain aging, a new study reveals, giving scientists a new target for understanding and potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-rapidly-aged-in-the-pandemic-and-it-wasnt-just-the-virus"&gt;brain deterioration&lt;/a&gt; and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 was brought to light through a careful comparison of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; part of the brain in mice of different ages. The hippocampus is involved in memory and learning, and it is one of the regions that suffers most from age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team found that FLT1 was the one protein in this region that old mice had more of and young mice had less of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by a team from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the researchers are hopeful that their findings will enlighten human treatments for neurodegenerative conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-brain-scan-halfway-through-your-life-can-reveal-how-fast-youre-aging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Single Brain Scan Halfway Through Your Life Can Reveal How Fast You're Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 is known to be related to storing iron in the body, but hasn't come up in relation to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; before. To test its involvement after their initial findings, the researchers used genetic editing to overexpress the protein in young mice, and reduce its level in old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg" alt="Cultured neurons" class="wp-image-172283 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neurons with a lot of FTL1 (right) had fewer branching arms, a sign of lower connectivity. (Remesal et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: the younger mice showed signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;impaired memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning abilities, as if they were getting old before their time, while in the older mice there were signs of restored cognitive function – some of the brain aging was effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves, this has only been demonstrated in mouse models, and there's a lot of work to do before this can be confirmed in people, but the early signs are promising when it comes to keeping older brains in a healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is truly a reversal of impairments," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Saul Villeda, from UCSF. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on cells in petri dishes showed how FTL1 stopped neurons from growing properly, with neural wires lacking the branching structures that typically provide links between nerve cells and improve brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the analysis carried out by the researchers, it seems that increased FTL1 may interfere with the mitochondria that act as the power stations of our cells. Mitochondria are closely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.028"&gt;linked to aging&lt;/a&gt; – it's as if they're light bulbs that get dimmer and dimmer as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;studying aging&lt;/a&gt; is picking apart which changes in the body are the result of aging, and which changes might be driving it. Through the collection of tests run here, it seems FTL1 is one of those drivers – at least in the hippocampuses of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can now look at how this might be applied to people, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172280" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;and Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. It's also going to be important to find out more about how FTL1 affects the brain, and what the full set of consequences of limiting it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Villeda. "It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;COVID context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all trials, there are limitations. As mentioned, the number of infections here is small—the impressive efficacy numbers could potentially vanish in a larger trial with more infections. And, while the trial had a high-quality design, it was undertaken in just one location in Germany and mostly involved healthy white women between the ages of 20 and 46, so the findings are not generalizable. The study was also funded by a pharmaceutical company that makes an azelastine nasal spray (though not the one that is sold over the counter in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the previous studies, the trial offers some hope that this accessible nasal spray could be used as a viral prophylactic for respiratory seasons in the future. And the results land at a time when access to COVID-19 vaccines—which have firmly proven to be safe and highly effective—has been severely restricted in the US by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, it appears that only people ages 65 and over, and those at higher risk of COVID-19 will have access to the shots this year, though some aspects of that access are murky, including how people will prove they're at high risk. For healthy children, teens, and adults under 65, there may be no access or extremely limited access. That includes groups that medical experts recommend get vaccinated, namely healthy pregnant people and children ages 6 months to 23 months, both of which are considered at high risk from COVID-19 by medical experts, but not federal guidance under Kennedy. Experts also recommend access for healthy people who have contact with vulnerable people, such as cancer doctors, people who live with immunocompromised family members, and people who work in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited vaccine access and the normal slew of respiratory viruses on the horizon, a simple nasal spray is an appealing addition to the defenses. The main side effects are fairly minor, including bitter taste in the mouth, nosebleeds, and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;

Another patient would go to Bronson QuickCare Plus for stitches and treatments for broken bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No services will change, but accessing the correct form of care is expected to improve, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recognized that there is some need to better understand the levels of care and where to obtain that care," Padgett told News Channel 3. "So, really, where do you go? What's your best walk-in option? And we recognize that with the different locations, names, it was confusing. So, we listened to that feedback and wanted to help our patients understand how to make this easier for them to make that decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost is an important factor for many patients. According to officials, the walk-ins' new names will help patients better understand how much they'll be billed when they go to the right place for the correct care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to do everything we can to help those patients understand their options and what to expect when they receive their bill," Padgett said. "So, launching this advertising campaign, getting in what we're looking, you'll see more of is trying to educate on the different real life health scenarios and where to go to get that care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients confused about their billing can contact Bronson Healthcare's 24/7 care advisor line at 269-341-7788.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:56:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gFBVV95cUxNVmJXcTh4SnZ3LTIxa1BMNlpic3dhZ1VzWjEwa0ZYNHhBYmpWNmlRUnU2eDdWODNzcXJDdlpUQ0ZoSWRXblBKMERrRXZDM25xWHMxMVpnaHhJX0lJY3FYV2FVLTJPTndvc19JM3Ryd0NuekJ6SjBkSER5dmlFQVg2UTk1UkVjUGxSSG5La1hnaURIU2s3akVuc0pMUUQ4ZmVFaHF4amE3VnBxLXkwZVA2MlBhcENsOXEwdmpwcDRRMGNlMzJ0ZkpWRHFMTVg3T1dYUjV2WnBNN0dvQlMtalFCYnQwMzRURmxUQUE</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州新冠肺炎疫情飙升：新型“Stratus”变种的注意事项-达拉斯新闻</title><link>https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/09/02/covid-19-surges-in-texas-what-to-know-about-new-stratus-variant/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Cases of &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/covid-19/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/covid-19/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; are spiking in Texas as a new variant spreads across much of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;COVID variant XFG, nicknamed Stratus, accounts for three-fourths of COVID cases in the U.S., according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly 18% of tests reported to the CDC from Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana were positive for COVID. A breakdown by individual states was not available, but the positivity rate nationwide is only 11.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Cases are likely far higher because many people test at home and do not report the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__sI3E3 p-7 mb-6 w-full h-64 border-t border-b border-black flex flex-col gap-7"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__2nIGz flex items-center justify-center gap-x-7"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__VBR0d flex-auto w-full flex flex-col"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__jO6ca secondaryBold secondaryBold-8 text-center"&gt;D-FW Public Health Alerts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__3beff secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-20 text-center text-gray-dark"&gt;Get the latest public health updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__WpP95 flex flex-col gap-7 items-center"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__8MgJa flex flex-wrap text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-20 text-center justify-center"&gt;By signing up, you agree to our &lt;a class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__lU9-l border-b border-gray-dark hover_border-0 focus_border-0 active_border-0" href="/help/terms-of-service/"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__lU9-l border-b border-gray-dark hover_border-0 focus_border-0 active_border-0" href="/help/privacy-policy"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services Director &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2020/04/09/meet-dr-philip-huang-the-lake-highlands-grad-who-is-helping-direct-how-dallas-county-responds-to-the-coronavirus/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2020/04/09/meet-dr-philip-huang-the-lake-highlands-grad-who-is-helping-direct-how-dallas-county-responds-to-the-coronavirus/"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday that all five wastewater monitoring sites in Dallas County have shown recent increases in COVID. Because case reporting for COVID is no longer mandated, monitoring largely relies on wastewater testing and lab reports from hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While the rate of COVID is not near the critical levels seen at the height of the pandemic, Huang said residents should take precautions to prevent spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Definitely we’re concerned about it, especially for those populations that are most vulnerable, the older populations and those with underlying health conditions,” Huang said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms of Stratus include congestion, cough, fever, runny nose, fatigue and muscle aches, similar to previous variants. In a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in June, the World Health Organization says it is monitoring the strain but that it does not appear to pose an additional public health threat compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Stratus recently surpassed the variant Nimbus, better known by its catchier moniker &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/"&gt;“razor blade throat,”&lt;/a&gt; named for the excruciating pain it causes. Patients have likened the sensation to swallowing razor blades or shards of glass. The variant is still spreading, accounting for 14% of cases, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Confusion over vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The spike in cases comes as widespread confusion about who will be eligible to get a vaccine this fall is growing. In May, U.S. Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced&lt;/a&gt; that COVID vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move questioned by some public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/"&gt;Food and Drug Administration provided new requirements&lt;/a&gt; for the shots, saying the vaccine would be available to adults 65 and older and children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/"&gt;U.S. regulators announced that new shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed its use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics is still calling for COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for healthy children beginning at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Until recently, the U.S. — following guidance from independent experts who advise the CDC — has recommended annual COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Kennedy fired every member of that Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-advisers-covid19-rsv-a85baa8a9296fd857af5ce33ae3b6cfd" rel=""&gt;The replacements&lt;/a&gt; he selected have yet to make new recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Approved COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against both the Stratus and Nimbus variants, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County has ordered the updated COVID vaccine but is waiting on delivery from the state, Huang told county commissioners. The county has set up &lt;a href="https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/clinical-services/immunization-clinics.php" rel=""&gt;Community Vaccine Clinics&lt;/a&gt; where residents can get COVID, flu and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:53:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUU1TbHBXXzdxRURxY3lRLS0tRHFlcHBTa2JHR1h6OUxIbjNScDROaHRLVFJKcVVIX1k5MjhRRWwxOHEyemFkcVRDaXZidVdEbUMyZlpEWWozRHB4bVJNakxYWVJOcmxZVGc1WVl1M09zX2pYV2VoNklnWDRsVFdSTkJxMkR0cTllNkZpMnc3YXhjbEJpZG45TjlTNTBLMENmUGdhQV9SU21nYXpVMWlPM2Z1TnF4SnFBVHNERkhR</guid></item><item><title>医生发现了新的潜在治疗方法，可以治疗让患者双手疼痛感冒的病症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058391/Doctors-discover-new-potential-treatment-condition-leaves-sufferers-hands-painfully-cold.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have identified a possible cure for a condition that causes chronic cold hands and blights hundreds of millions of people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to five percent of adults worldwide, including up to 30 million Americans - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels in the fingers, toes, ears or nose, which in turn cuts off the blood supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers often go numb in these areas as the blood is limited and skin turns white. During severe attacks, Raynaud's can cause extremely painful symptoms, and even painful sores or tissue death (gangrene) in the affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for Raynaud's, doctors at Yubei District People's Hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-e071b5b0-8813-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have reported how a minimally invasive surgery could hold the key to keeping symptoms at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/948422"&gt;They detail a case&lt;/a&gt; involving a 67-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of Raynaud's who was admitted to the hospital as her condition worsened and led to gangrene in her right index and middle fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help alleviate the symptoms, the doctors performed a periosteal distraction osteogenesis (PDO), a minimally invasive operation to stimulate the growth of new bone in areas that have sustained bone loss, which can occur in very severe cases of Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure involves separating the membrane covering a bone to create a gap.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often used to treat diabetic foot ulcers and bone loss by promoting the formation of new blood vessels and bone regeneration, leading to improved healing rates and a reduced need for amputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the medical team at Yubei District People's Hospital decided to apply the treatment to the female patient's hand to treat her gangrene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gangrene occurs when the blood supply to a certain area of the body is interrupted, usually through an injury or infection, and flesh begins to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous case study was also suffering from 'hand ischemia', a condition where blood flow to the hands is reduced or blocked, leading to tissue damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing a PDO, the doctors reported that the patient's gangrene 'gradually progressively healed', and the pain in both hands caused by the Raynaud's 'markedly diminished.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed a PDO could work for Raynaud's as it promotes blood vessels to heal and this could prevent spasms from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could also help heal bone loss when the condition progresses. Bone loss associated with Raynaud's is known as acro-osteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded: 'This report supports recent studies that have shown the potential for periosteal distraction osteogenesis in the management of cases of severe and irreversible Raynaud disease of the digits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More research is being done around Raynaud's and scientists recently discovered a link between the condition and two gene mutations  - one linked to stress and the other to embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers in the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-3ac79a90-691a-11ee-86b3-2b7100f3870f"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; carried out the largest genetic study of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used electronic medical records from the UK Biobank, a database containing genetic and health information from 439,294 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team identified 5,147 people diagnosed with Raynaud's and discovered a variation in two genes that predisposed people to the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One variation was the alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor for adrenaline, or ADRA2A. This is a stress receptor that causes the small blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body - most commonly the fingers, but sometimes also the toes, ears, and tip of the nose &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second variation was the IRX1, a type of protein shown to be involved in early embryo development and cellular differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers discovered a potential benefit of using the antidepressant medication mirtazapine to treat Raynaud's, as it inhibits the function of ADRA2A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it has not yet been proven safe or effective for this use through clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were able to replicate some of their findings using data from people of British Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found people with a genetic predisposition to low blood sugar levels have an increased risk of the syndrome, suggesting people should avoid long periods of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' findings help to understand, for the first time, why the small vessels react so strongly in patients, even without external stimuli like exposure to cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main types of Raynaud's: primary and secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary is the most common and is not a result of a medical condition a person may have and can be so mild a person may not need treatment. It also may go away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted. As the tissues lose oxygen, fingers will turn a bluish hue.

It is less common than primary but often more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare experts have identified potential lifestyle and medical causes of the disease, which can include smoking, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, diseases of the arteries and carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They've also identified risk factors, including age, sex, climate and family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted. As the tissues lose oxygen, fingers will turn a bluish hue. As blood flow returns, fingers turn red and people may experience tingling, swelling and/or painful throbbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As there is no cure or current treatment for the syndrome, the goal is to manage the symptoms by reducing their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-e8d93a50-8810-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-f37642f0-0dac-11e8-8d90-317dbab06c13" data-permabox-url="/news/fb-5372739/What-Raynauds-disease.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's condition, triggered by drops in temperature or an increase in stress, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Raynaud's causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although Raynaud's is common, only a small number of patients go on to develop a more serious connective tissue disease called scleroderma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause disability and can be life-threatening, which is why it is important to be diagnosed early on so any complications of the condition can be properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's has a straightforward treatment and can be temporarily cured with a drug called nifedipine which relaxes the muscles of your heart and blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:51:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPNGwtODBva2xHQU85NUZUV2EyS3BpWGJ6RTVDRWtUblE1UnZpc0xBUEhRajVuWmJ6VHBvQ3RqN0Y3SWEtS04zUmIxM2RtblNJLW95bzlocExaOHJzSFdzOUp5NXUtRzZWOEE4R3ZhYlM1ZndiU2VjTnNLZnJ0M0I2NWVGUV9xWkxnQVJQeW5sX1paczBudzF1NllCallrZkdienZpRXJQUm8ycjQzQ01xS09vT2hoMnlvQUMybU1UV2hwWmpYRHdzTHZBRGYwRTRhcldYWTExWXFReDlsYmfSAeMBQVVfeXFMTzVkeldLTW5iRnFKWEFmN203T2lCdnhIbGZzZ1Q4ckNLSHhiWFRPX1BfOFVyYmVyajIzYTF3Z3hYZy1sMDhxYms5ZEZoZ3gxckE4azY0bUJlTWQwSWhHSi1fWjRXcnIzbldmRzA4eWI0UlJrVDJNZVBnTEk2SmZWb1EwOVYwUHZiNHFlYjV3ZDJaN3FrU2V3UF96ZWFLYjdleUMza2NCN0dmS2xxb05TanlTSEVWOWhPbkJJQkVlbEUxTFMzbVY2WWVnOHgzNjRtRXpWVEd5YzdKOFF3bWlLcHotNTQ</guid></item><item><title>慢性压力将免疫细胞送到大脑，导致抑郁症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/depression-neutrophils-stress-29654/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that chronic stress causes immune cells called neutrophils to leave bone marrow in the skull and collect in the brain’s protective membranes, where they contribute to depressive symptoms. In mice, blocking an immune “alarm” pathway reduced these cells and improved mood-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how stress reshapes the brain’s immune environment and suggest why one-third of patients may not benefit from current antidepressants. This immune link could provide biomarkers for tailored treatments and help explain depression’s overlap with neurological conditions like stroke and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress triggers neutrophils from skull bone marrow to enter the brain’s meninges, influencing mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking type I interferon signaling reduced brain neutrophils and depressive behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could guide new immune-targeted therapies for depression resistant to standard drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cells released from bone marrow in the skull in response to chronic stress and adversity could play a key role in symptoms of depression and anxiety, say researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery – found in a study in mice – sheds light on the role that inflammation can play in mood disorders and could help in the search for new treatments, in particular for those individuals for whom current treatments are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1 billion people will be diagnosed with a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may be many underlying causes, chronic inflammation – when the body’s immune system stays active for a long time, even when there is no infection or injury to fight – has been linked to depression. This suggests that the immune system may play an important role in the development of mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have highlighted how high levels of an immune cell known as a neutrophil, a type of white blood cell, are linked to the severity of depression. But how neutrophils contribute to symptoms of depression is currently unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, UK, and the National Institute of Mental Health, USA, tested a hypothesis that chronic stress can lead to the release of neutrophils from bone marrow in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells then collect in the meninges – membranes that cover and protect your brain and spinal cord – and contribute to symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is not possible to test this hypothesis in humans, the team used mice exposed to chronic social stress. In this experiment, an ‘intruder’ mouse is introduced into the home cage of an aggressive resident mouse. The two have brief daily physical interactions and can otherwise see, smell, and hear each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that prolonged exposure to this stressful environment led to a noticeable increase in levels of neutrophils in the meninges, and that this was linked to signs of depressive behaviour in the mice. Even after the stress ended, the neutrophils lasted longer in the meninges than they did in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis confirmed the researchers’ hypothesis that the meningeal neutrophils – which appeared subtly different from those found in the blood – originated in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that long-term stress triggered a type of immune system ‘alarm warning’ known as type I interferon signalling in the neutrophils. Blocking this pathway – in effect, switching off the alarm – reduced the number of neutrophils in the meninges and improved behaviour in the depressed mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway has previously been linked to depression – type 1 interferons are used to treat patients with hepatitis C, for example, but a known side effect of the medication is that it can cause severe depression during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Stacey Kigar from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge said: “Our work helps explain how chronic stress can lead to lasting changes in the brain’s immune environment, potentially contributing to depression. It also opens the door to possible new treatments that target the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a significant proportion of people for whom antidepressants don’t work, possibly as many as one in three patients. If we can figure out what’s happening with the immune system, we may be able to alleviate or reduce depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there are high levels of neutrophils in the meninges is unclear. One explanation could be that they are recruited by microglia, a type of immune cell unique to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that chronic stress may cause microhaemorrhages, tiny leaks in brain blood vessels, and that neutrophils – the body’s ‘first responders’ – arrive to fix the damage and prevent any further damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neutrophils then become more rigid, possibly getting stuck in brain capillaries and causing further inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Mary-Ellen Lynall from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge said: “We’ve long known that something is different about how neutrophils behave after stressful events, or during depression, but we didn’t know what these neutrophils were doing, where they were going, or how they might be affecting the brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that these ‘first responder’ immune cells leave the skull bone marrow and travel to the brain, where they can influence mood and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will have experienced how our immune systems can drive short-lived depression-like symptoms. When we are sick, for example with a cold or flu, we often lack energy and appetite, sleep more and withdraw from social contact. If the immune system is always in a heightened, pro-inflammatory state, it shouldn’t be too surprising if we experience longer-term problems with our mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide a useful signature, or ‘biomarker’, to help identify those patients whose mood disorders are related to inflammation. This could help in the search for better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a clinical trial of a potential new drug that targets inflammation of the brain in depression might appear to fail if trialled on a general cohort of people with depression, whereas using the biomarker to identify individuals whose depression is linked to inflammation could increase the likelihood of the trial succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may also help explain why depression is a symptom common in other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease, as it may be the case that neutrophils are being released in response to the damage to the brain seen in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may also explain why depression is itself a risk factor for dementia in later life, if neutrophils can themselves trigger damage to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b4a5b6beb0f9b5a5beb2a5bbb2ae97b6b3babeb9f9b4b6baf9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Brierley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Brierley – University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62840-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Stacey Kigar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are associated with blood neutrophilia.

Transcriptional analysis suggests CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protects against the negative behavioral effects of CSD stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitlate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:15:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1DWnFUckhEbkFLWGNIOEYzZF9hUmdDNFJfdjVhd1ZYNTVlcXJCaDNUaTVqMWdKalUzbEVtYkZPelhSWnVHVkdyV3EyN0dZdkRNcks1aEVMcXAxRGNrLThHQXdodVVIckNlQnNfNV8wbnRBOWs</guid></item><item><title>植物性营养素可以提高免疫细胞对抗癌症的能力- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-based-nutrient-boost-immune-cells.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from the University of Chicago discovered that zeaxanthin, a plant-derived carotenoid best known for protecting vision, may also act as an immune-boosting compound by strengthening the cancer-fighting activity of immune cells. The findings, which are published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00397-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlight the potential of zeaxanthin as a widely available supplement to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/eye+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;eye health&lt;/a&gt;, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity," said Jing Chen, Ph.D., Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our study shows that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments like immunotherapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this nutrient work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds on years of work by Chen's lab to better understand how nutrients influence the immune system. By screening a large blood nutrient library, the team identified zeaxanthin as a compound that directly enhances the activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, a crucial type of immune cell that kills &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt;. These cells rely on a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+structure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular structure&lt;/a&gt; called the T-cell receptor (TCR) to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that zeaxanthin stabilizes and strengthens the formation of TCR complex on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells upon interacting with the cancer cells. This, in turn, triggers more robust intracellular signaling that boosts T-cell activation, cytokine production, and tumor-killing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Zeaxanthin improves immunotherapy effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, dietary supplementation with zeaxanthin slowed tumor growth. Importantly, when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors—a type of immunotherapy that has transformed cancer treatment in recent years—zeaxanthin significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects compared to immunotherapy alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells' ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A safe and accessible candidate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It's inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known—which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reinforces the importance of a balanced diet. In their previous research, Chen's group discovered that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-nutrient-beef-dairy-immune-response.html"&gt;trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat&lt;/a&gt;, also boosts T-cell activity—but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clinical applications of zeaxanthin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that the work is still at an early stage. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to determine whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/zeaxanthin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt; supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level," Chen said. "With more research, we may discover natural compounds that make today's cancer therapies more effective and accessible."&lt;/p&gt;

It helps bulk up stools to make them easier to pass, promoting regular bowel movements. It also slows gastric emptying, which leads to longer feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the shorter term, not getting at least 21 to 38 grams of daily fiber, depending on age and sex, can lead to constipation, bloating, cramping and gas. But over time, low fiber has been linked to chronic inflammation, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-51e2f670-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-51e28140-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, health experts are now sounding the alarm over getting too much fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media users are promoting 'fibermaxxing,' or loading up on large amounts of fiber, particularly from the plethora of emerging sodas and snacks high in the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitians and physicians told DailyMail.com that while fiber is essential for maintaining healthy digestion, too much can lead to 'gastrointestinal distress,' including constipation, bloating, gas and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the long term, getting upwards of 50 grams per day may lead to a rare chance of intestinal blockages. Emerging research also shows certain kinds of fiber like inulin, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;found in high-fiber drinks like Poppi&lt;/a&gt;, may increase the risk of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 95 percent of Americans don't get enough fiber-rich foods like broccoli and whole grains. But experts have warned of the dangers of eating too much (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paris Hilton is among Poppi's high profile fans. The soda is high in inulin, a type of fiber that some studies have linked to cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Candace Pumper, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told DailyMail.com: 'Consuming adequate fiber within established guidelines in our diet is important for optimal health and bodily function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary fiber provides many functional benefits – such as adding bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation – and physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects have been shown to lower cholesterol, regulate blood sugar, promote satiety and reduce inflammation, Pumper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regulating these functions, she noted, is associated 'with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Most Americans are not meeting the recommended daily amount of dietary fiber, making its optimization an important health strategy for reducing their risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help fill these gaps, snacks and sodas high in fiber have gained popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poppi and Olipop, for instance, contain between three to nine grams of inulin, a form of dietary fiber found naturally in some plants chicory root, garlic, onions, and Jerusalem artichoke. It is also considered a fructan, a type of prebiotic, meaning it can help feed 'good' bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gut bacteria convert inulin and other prebiotics into short-chain fatty acids, which can help strengthen the gut's protective lining and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a growing body of research suggests repeated inulin consumption could lead to long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Gewirtz, a biomedical science professor at Georgia State University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gsu.edu/2018/10/18/adding-refined-fiber-to-processed-food-could-have-negative-health-effects-study-finds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;conducted a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that found mice who had inulin added to their diets developed jaundice, a sign of liver failure. After six months, they showed signs of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277257232300198X"&gt;2024 case study&lt;/a&gt; authored by the same team suggested inulin 'may be carcinogenic.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olipop is one of the most popular fiber-rich soda brands, generating $500million in sales last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the case study had his first colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer at age 56, which came back normal. But seven years later, another screening showed a malignant tumor at the start of his large intestine. The disease had also spread to his lymph nodes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now in his 60s, the man had no known colon cancer risk factors like obesity, alcohol use, or family history, and his diet was rich in organic, home-grown vegetables. His only lifestyle change in the time between screenings was adding four grams of inulin powder daily to his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gena Hamshaw, a registered dietitian at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told DailyMail.com: 'While inulin in sodas may favor a healthy balance of intestinal flora, it doesn’t offer all of the benefits of other types of fiber, such as the inhibition of cholesterol absorption that’s associated with soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s important to remember that there are different types of fiber, each with benefits, and the best means of reaping all of their benefits is to eat a varied diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking several of these sodas could quickly increase overall fiber consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;previously reached out&lt;/a&gt; to Poppi and Olipop regarding these claims but did not hear back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olipop &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/29/poppi-olipop-healthy-soda-warning"&gt;told Axios&lt;/a&gt; in a March statement: 'Like any fiber, inulin may cause temporary digestive discomfort as the body adjusts to increased fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why both nutrition experts and OLIPOP recommend starting with one can and gradually increasing over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brea Lofton, a registered dietitian nutritionist at health and wellness company Lumen, told this website that while it 'is undoubted that fiber can be beneficial for a number of reasons,' consuming excessive amounts, 'especially when you increase your fiber intake too quickly, can lead to gastrointestinal distress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told DailyMail.com to get a variety of fiber sources instead of relying on one or two from processed foods (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pumper said: 'Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overdoing it can also cause constipation and impair nutrient absorption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the gut microbiome needs time to adjust to increased fiber if someone generally consumes under the recommended amount.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website that while rare, 'an intestinal blockage could be the result of extremely high fiber intake, especially without good hydration and enough chewing of food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In large quantities and without enough water to help with absorption, undigested fiber can form a dense mass called a bezoar. This risk is highest in people with digestive conditions like Crohn's disease or previous bowel surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another long-term concern is that excessive fiber intake may inhibit absorption of important minerals, including iron, zinc, and calcium,' Hamshaw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said while there is no firm limit, getting upwards of 50 grams of fiber per day is enough to cause complications. Dr Omer Awan, a medical professor at the University of Maryland with a specialization in epidemiology, meanwhile told DailyMail.com the limit might be closer to 70 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website: 'It's also good to keep in mind that the plant foods with the most dietary fiber, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, and nuts, are typically nutrient-dense foods. These foods offer phytonutrients, minerals, and vitamins as well as dietary fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fiber-fortified snacks and sodas can definitely be part of a healthful dietary pattern. But if maximizing nutrient intake is your goal, then the best strategy is to favor naturally occurring fiber that’s found in otherwise nutritious foods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They'd rather not think about the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) Director Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, the mistakes that were made during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lessons learned, provide an opportunity to explore how a future pandemic caused by an even deadlier virus than SARS-CoV-2 could play out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Osterholm and his co-author and longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker weave together two threads. One is an assessment of how the COVID-19 pandemic was handled by the US government and public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osterholm says it's the culmination of a project that began early on in the pandemic, when he and Olshaker recognized that many mistakes were being made and they authored several op-eds that were critical of the federal response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"At that point, we realized we really needed to write a book about this pandemic when it finally ends, and what lessons should be learned," he says in an upcoming episode of the Osterholm Update podcast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along the way, Osterholm and Olshaker address many of the most prominent controversies that have come to dominate the national discussion about the pandemic, from lockdowns and school closures to communications failures and the debates over masking and vaccine mandates. The aim was not just to highlight the mistakes or place blame, but to understand the lessons that can be drawn from those mistakes and then applied to the next pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Some of the problems we collectively encountered were structural, and not quick or easy to solve," Osterholm and Olshaker write. "But they all have to be addressed if we are to have a chance of triumphing in the microbe wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;'A great mystery story'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next pandemic is the focus of the other strand of the book, a "thought experiment" developed by Osterholm and Olshaker that traces the path of a hypothetical virus that originates in Somalia, soon jumps to a nearby refugee camp in Kenya, and then spreads like wildfire around the globe. The virus, eventually labeled SARS-CoV-3, combines the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 with the lethality of the original SARS virus (which caused a global outbreak in 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?" asks Osterholm, who is also a Regents Professor and the McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health at the University of Minnesota. "And believe it or not, we have now found viruses—in bats in caves in China—that have that construct. So this is not just science fiction; we actually know these viruses exist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scenario describes the impact of the virus as it spreads and causes havoc around the globe, but it also delves into the response from US and global officials, the public reaction, and the role of the media. For many readers, it might feel like being transported back to early 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olshaker says they wanted to create a "nightmare scenario" that was realistic, scientifically plausible, not over-the-top, and gripping.

              &lt;p&gt;A common treatment given after heart attacks may not be worthwhile for a large segment of the population. New trial data finds that most people who suffer a heart attack do not benefit from taking beta-blockers afterward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large international team of researchers conducted the trial, which compared the outcomes of nearly 10,000 heart attack patients who were either given beta-blocker therapy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, people with preserved heart function given beta-blockers were no less likely to die or to experience a second heart attack than those not given beta-blockers, the researchers found. Secondary data also showed that women might actually face a higher risk of complications from taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines,” said senior study author Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831010539.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why doctors use beta-blockers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more than 40 years, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; have been a key aspect of treating and managing cardiovascular disease. These drugs block the effects of adrenaline on the body’s beta-receptors, which then reduces heart rate and lowers blood pressure (among other bodily changes). They’re often used to reduce stress on a badly damaged heart following a heart attack (myocardial infarction), in theory lowering the risk of a second heart attack or other cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But heart medicine has evolved greatly since the arrival of the first beta-blockers in the 1960s. New treatments and improved knowledge have made it easier for doctors to prevent these infarctions from causing as much damage to the heart as before. And that’s led some researchers to wonder whether beta-blockers should still be considered a front-line treatment following heart attacks, including the team behind this large new trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A therapy in need of a reboot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s trial, named REBOOT, involved roughly 8,500 people. The patients had all experienced relatively mild heart attacks and appeared to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) above 40%. LVEF measures how well our left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) pumps out blood. A healthy LVEF is typically considered above 51%, while slightly reduced function is between 40% and 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Half of the patients were randomized to receive beta-blockers after being discharged from the hospital, while the other half received none. Both groups were then tracked for several years (median length 3.7 years).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, there wasn’t any significant difference in outcomes between the two groups. Deaths (from any cause), secondary heart attacks, and hospitalizations from heart failure occurred just as often in the beta-blocker group as they did in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since these kinds of heart attacks represent the majority of cases (roughly 80%) today, the team’s findings—&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine—indicate that beta-blockers shouldn’t be a standard treatment for most heart attack patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Harmful for some, useful for others&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While beta-blocker therapy may be worthless for most male heart attack patients, it could be actively dangerous to women in particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis of the REBOOT results, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf673/8243876"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the European Heart Journal, women on beta-blockers had higher rates of heart attacks, hospitalization, and death than women not on the drug. On closer inspection, this added risk was only seen in women who maintained normal heart function (LVEF above 50%). Though it’s not entirely clear why only women might experience this risk, studies have found that heart attacks can &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/02/09/the-slowly-evolving-truth-about-heart-disease-and-women#:~:text=As%20for%20better,in%20their%20arteries."&gt;present differently&lt;/a&gt; in women compared to men and cause differing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should better optimize the long-term care of heart attack patients, who are often already prescribed multiple medications to keep their cardiovascular health in check. “These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” said lead author Borja Ibáñez, scientific director of Spain’s National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC), in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the REBOOT trial won’t bury beta-blockers for good. The drugs may still help prevent complications in people with severe heart attacks and are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers"&gt;widely used&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions, including congestive heart failure, migraines, and even performance anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8sw000o3b7abepiwsjm@published"&gt;I’m a straight, cis female. My whole adult life, vaginal sex has always been sort of meh to me. I love the foreplay, my clitoris is very sensitive, and I get easily turned on. But when it comes to the actual intercourse part, it’s always felt like nothing at best and vaguely painful at worst. I’ve seen doctors, but the symptoms of conditions like vaginismus and vulvodynia don’t really match mine. It kind of just feels like I have no nerve endings in there at all. I’ve also gone to bed with enough men to know it’s not just a bad partner. Toys do nothing for me either.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8w8000p3b7atmv99318@published"&gt;A few months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2wpz4j005y3b7apvy06pmb@published"&gt;We had anal sex. I’d always been resistant to anal because I have some digestive issues, but wanted to try it, so we did, and WOW. It’s like whatever nerves are missing from my vagina got put in the back door instead. I finally understood what people love about penetrative sex, and it didn’t hurt at all. I’ve never had an orgasm just from penetration before until that night, when I had like three or four in a row without touching my clit at all. It’s not just the orgasm part; it’s just the feeling of anything at all pleasurable from penetration. It got even better the deeper my partner went (whereas in regular PIV, I tend to have less sensation the deeper it is).&lt;/p&gt;

The digestive issues have not improved (and actually have worsened). And I don’t think my boyfriend wants to do anal every single time we have sex (is that even healthy?). Why does anal sex feel so good for me compared to vaginal sex? Everything I’ve seen online says even the cis females who enjoy anal and find that it feels good still prefer vaginal sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmf2y1b6v006n3b7awp4rky2i@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="319"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, for some people, anal sex can definitely be a pleasurable alternative. The anus and rectum have different nerve endings and innervation patterns compared to the vagina, which can translate into entirely different sensations. The so-called “A-spot” (anterior fornix) and surrounding nerve-rich tissue can create intense stimulation and, for many, powerful orgasms. Pleasure here often comes down to anatomy, muscle relaxation, and pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anal canal is surrounded by muscles that need to be relaxed, and its skin is thinner and more delicate, which means lubrication, patience, and gradual progression are absolutely necessary. This is where tools like anal dilators (such as &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/glass-anal-dilator-set"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/silicone-anal-dilator-set"&gt;silicone&lt;/a&gt; sets, like the ones I developed for Future Method) can help train both body and mind. Starting small, pre-lubricating, and working up in size conditions the muscles and tissue to stretch comfortably. Many people also find that experimenting with different positions, depth, and thrusting styles during toy play helps them discover what feels good while maintaining control over the experience. I’m a huge advocate of personal exploration because it allows people to see what they like (and don’t like) without the pressure of having to perform for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common worry is the digestive system “getting in the way.” The reality is that with everyday anal play, the rectum is usually clear of stool. Good digestive health makes a huge difference, such as adequate dietary fiber, probiotics, and hydration to support regularity and reduce the likelihood of issues. If someone chooses to prepare ahead of time, I recommend douching safely; over-cleansing with plain water, harsh soaps, or even store-bought enemas can damage tissue and disrupt the microbiome. That’s why I developed an &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/anal-douche-kit"&gt;isotonic cleansing solution&lt;/a&gt; at Future Method, designed to be body-compatible, non-irritating, and effective without stripping natural defenses. I know people crave confidence when it comes to anal play, so why not have a body-safe solution to help you achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here’s what Dr. Goldstein recommends: “For vaginal pain: a gynecologist trained in sexual pain disorders, for anal health concerns: a proctological surgeon, and for pelvic floor dysfunction or muscle-related pain: a pelvic floor physical therapist,” adding that “each of these specialists brings a different perspective, and ideally, they work together to ensure a holistic plan.”&lt;/p&gt;

His preferences will likely be a balance between how he feels about the act itself and how he feels about your pleasure, and he’s the only person who can say, with certainty, what his stance is.&lt;/p&gt;

So be prepared for some to shrug or mention that they’ve encountered squirters previously, for others to fetishize you, for still more to have LOTS of questions, and also for a few to immediately thank you for your time and permanently excuse themselves. If you’re happy to be glorified for something your body does by happenstance, go forth and enjoy, because you will find plenty of salivating supplicants. If you’re willing to give a personal Q&amp;amp;A session to satiate someone’s curiosity, again, great. If you’re not OK with either of those scenarios, always know that you get to have boundaries, and you get to decide how you’re willing to be treated in hook-ups and relationships. And you get to make those choices from date to date, depending on the context of the person you’re interacting with and how you’re feeling that day.&lt;/p&gt;

The place we’ve rented has a private hot tub, so my husband and I finally got to realize our fantasy of skinny dipping together. While we were in the hot tub, I rediscovered an old favorite of mine. When I was a kid, I used to swim competitively, so I spent a lot of time in the pool. When I was very young, I accidentally discovered that the pool jet against my clit felt amazing. When I got a little older, I connected the dots and realized I’d essentially been masturbating in public, so I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

When I first noticed our “slump,” he told me he was too busy and tired from work to have sex. After the first sexless year rolled by, he said he needed to lose weight to feel confident enough for sex. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/02/husband-does-not-want-sex-advice.html"&gt;Since, we moved to a new city last year, and he has indeed lost weight and gotten a job that requires much less take-home work…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID cases are high in Texas, California, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico and other states in the West and South Central part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s worth knowing that COVID tracking data is less reliable now &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-cases-up-summer-why_l_68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" title="" target="_blank"&gt;because of COVID funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration&lt;/strong&gt;, less testing and the discontinuation of certain tools researchers relied on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing cases increase here in Houston, and in Texas, and if we look at the data that is available from [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], it certainly seems like the South Central U.S. — Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana — are seeing some of the higher test positivity rates in the in the country,” said &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/faculty/scott-long/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. S. Wesley Long&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/scott-c-roberts/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease doctor at Yale Medicine in Connecticut, “the highest test positivity is in the Texas region ... with the second highest kind of broadly being the West Coast. So, the Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada areas, but that does extend through Colorado and then the Dakotas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID cases are rising throughout the country, but rates are lower in the Eastern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new COVID variants, Stratus and Nimbus, are behind the summer increase in cases, said Roberts, but they are not any more severe than previous COVID strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simple lifestyle changes can help, and the NHS says people who smoke, are overweight and drink too much alcohol are more likely to snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say sleeping on your back can make you more likely to have the annoying habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can be caused by sleep apnoea which is estimated to affect 15 million Britons according to the British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two distinct types of sleep apnoea, Central Sleep Apnoea (CSA) and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CSA is caused by the brain not sending proper signals to the muscles that control breathing during sleep whereas OSA is caused by the upper airways being obstructed, Mr Surda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More people are affected by obstructive sleep apnoea than central sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to regular snoring, sleep apnoea occurs when the muscles at the back of the throat relax excessively, causing the airway to become partially or fully blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously Dr Pavol Surda, a sleep-disordered breathing expert at London Bridge Hospital &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13644345/snoring-problem-increase-risk-heart-disease.html"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;the Daily Mail it is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'If you suspect that you or a loved one may have sleep apnoea, seeking help from a specialist is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specialists can conduct a thorough evaluation, often involving a sleep study to monitor breathing patterns, oxygen levels, and other vital signs during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include lifestyle changes, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, oral appliances, or in some cases, surgery.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES — It’s one of the most insidious diseases you’ve never heard of, but Chagas is here in California and 29 other states across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It kills more people in Latin America than malaria each year, and researchers think roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5154432/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;300,000 people in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; currently have it but are unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the illness tends to lie dormant for years, only making itself known when its victim keels over via heart attack, stroke or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi,&lt;/em&gt; which lives in a bloodsucking insect called the kissing bug. There are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite. Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles’ Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s why a team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning consistently present, in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas. “But it’s also here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it,” said Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He said the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kissing bugs are pretty equal opportunity when it comes to who they take a blood meal from,” said Sarah Hamer, an epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, listing off a variety of animals, such as ocelots, bobcats, coyotes, birds, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means the reservoir for &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi &lt;/em&gt;is pretty large,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has the largest number of people in the U.S. infected with Chagas disease —  between 70,000 and 100,000. That’s mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is endemic. But it’s also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be home-grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013036" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; by the state’s Department of Public Health, for instance, found that 31 of 40 human cases reported to the state between 2013 and 2023 — about 78% — were acquired in other countries. For the remaining cases, health officials couldn’t rule out local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas is not a reportable disease in California, which means the state does not require physicians and health systems to report and investigate it, as it does with influenza, Lyme and malaria. However, it is reportable in Los Angeles and San Diego counties; Los Angeles was the first county in the state to mandate reporting of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2023, health officials confirmed about 18 cases of Chagas disease in L.A. County, “although many more cases likely go undiagnosed,” the department wrote in a statement. It said most of the identified cases were infected internationally, but some appear to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg” and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. “There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people find out they have the disease only after trying to donate blood, said Hamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janeice Smith, a retired teacher in Florida, discovered she had it in 2022 after receiving a letter from her local donation center telling her she’d tested positive and should go see a physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith now runs &lt;a href="https://kissingbugalliance.org/janeices-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; to increase awareness of Chagas, which she said she probably got in 1966 when her family went to Mexico for vacation. She had returned home with a swollen eye and high fever, and was hospitalized for several weeks. No one found out what caused her symptoms until almost six decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamer said proteins in the kissing bugs’ saliva can cause acute reactions, such as swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, all unrelated to the disease-carrying parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s the longer-term or chronic effects that cause the most harm. And because the disease is not well known, and its symptoms are often indistinguishable from other forms of cardiac and organ damage, it’s likely many people are showing up to their doctors’ offices with heart arrhythmia, a swollen esophagus, seizures and stroke, without ever being screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The disease is definitely underdiagnosed,” said Hernandez, the Kaiser cardiologist. “If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div class="pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15"&gt;&lt;p class="pull-quote-content"&gt;The disease is definitely underdiagnosed. If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist in Northern California&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-parasitic medications can be used to stop disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas is also prevalent in dogs who show similar clinical signs, heart failure or arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll see these acutely infected, usually young dogs that might be puppies, or dogs less than 1 or 2 years of age that are really adversely affected. And then we would have dogs that would come in older, and they might be in heart failure,” said Ashley Saunders, a Texas A&amp;amp;M veterinary cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said dogs often acquire the disease by eating the bugs, which give a much higher “dose” of the parasite than a few bug poops in a cut.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, attempting to limit overdiagnoses may now be contributing to the rising incidence of the advanced-stage prostate cancers, Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All men age 45 and above should have a discussion with their doctors about the right time to be tested for prostate cancer, Kamal advised. A doctor might recommend no testing, but for many men, having some sort of testing regimen is the best path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The ACS has suggested federal legislation to waive cost-sharing requirements such as deductibles and copayments for prostate cancer screening tests for men at high risk for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prostate cancer death rates were two times higher for Black men compared to any other racial or ethnic group, according to the report. Likewise, the report found Native American men had a 12% higher rate of death from the disease compared to White men, despite a 13% lower incidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Oftentimes we might think of a one-size-fits-all approach to how we manage risk and how we have these conversations, but certainly if we know that certain populations based on their backgrounds may have higher mortality, it might change our threshold for the testing we do, the urgency by which we do it, and the frequency by which we do it," Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis among men in the U.S., accounting for 30% of male cancers in 2025, and is the second leading cancer death in men behind lung cancer, according to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's interesting is that for many patients the conversation around a PSA and the discussion of the result then highlights other components of someone's health history that may also be important," Kamal noted. "Men generally don't like coming to the doctor and so this gave a focal point to have a conversation about prostate health but also things beyond that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Raihan El-Naas, MD is a board-certified internal medicine physician and current endocrinology fellow at Weill Cornell Medical Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPNHo4ZHBxdTczeG1SaENWVWUtVHdkWnpKb1NGRExvdDB4YU0zeTdPUVpSWUhZNkF5Z3RBOGl4cFNHUC16aWhER0pLeFJMZDl1OHpqbFdKVjljbjVqbmlGdG9UWWpja1RqSUZ5elBndVNnWDJhcVBIR0JUaDdLWTNxUldObE9LM2gySklOTU9mWTF6by16dVQ5TnA4aFFfZnhr0gGmAUFVX3lxTE93T196SWtqTExOam9MM2RpRVhMTmhFYzFlZTZ5SlExemRPRlNaTndrRlNhRTREcWdZOHNHVjBMLU41ak1ienFtNXp5XzUxMVJabjhwU3VVdjRwQjNRQWtDLVM2STFmbkZOaXFJWGhWTnU3M2x2R3hlb2tnTDVod0p4eTdlLURJMFVfQzc0b0FnMHowcFpoRmFIa3Nzak5XUXZvRWY4SGc</guid></item><item><title>看起来干净的水可能充满了看不见的致命细菌- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/water-that-looks-clean-may-be-full-of-invisible-and-deadly-bacteria/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot cars turn sealed bottles of water into tiny laboratories. A bottle that looks clear can quietly change  inside, and what you cannot see still matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmth and light do two things. They help microbes multiply after a single sip, and they also stress the plastic itself, allowing particles and additives to work their way into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beizhan Yan from Columbia University’s &lt;a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has led key research on how plastic particles appear in bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-turns-bottles-into-incubators"&gt;Heat turns bottles into incubators&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a bottle is opened, microbes hitch a ride from your mouth, your hands, or the air. A 2005 analysis reported that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-bacteria-breathe-by-creating-electricity/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in room temperature bottled water can surge within 48 hours after a single sip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat speeds that up. In closed cars, interiors often rise well above the outside air, and at about 77°F (25°C), microbes can multiply quickly, including species associated with foodborne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many single-use bottles are made of &lt;em&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/em&gt;. Sunlight and warmth cause this material to break down at the surface, allowing tiny fragments to move into the liquid..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study that simulated in-vehicle heat and sunlight measured up to 10.03 parts per million of microplastics in bottled water after 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those particles came from the bottle walls during photothermal stress, not from outside contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nanoplastics-revealed-in-bottled-water"&gt;Nanoplastics revealed in bottled water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier surveys already showed how widespread the problem is. An international survey reported that 93 percent of bottled water contained plastic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New tools peered even smaller. In 2024, a peer reviewed paper used laser based imaging to count about 240,000 particles per liter in popular brands, and most were nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens a window where we can look into a world that was not exposed to us before,” said Beizhan Yan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens after you swallow them is now under the microscope. A 2025 report on autopsies found &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-plastic-particles-found-in-human-egg-and-sperm-fluids/"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; lodged in human brain tissue, with higher levels than in the liver or kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work tracked particle types and sizes and suggested that nanoscale shards can cross biological barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results do not prove harm by themselves, but they demonstrate that particles can reach places where the body is most sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-rise-faster-in-water-bottles"&gt;Bacteria rise faster in water bottles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical story often grabs headlines, but the biological risk can be immediate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same 2005 analysis found that bacterial counts in opened bottles at room temperature rose steeply within two days, while refrigeration slowed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern matches everyday experience. Closed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/51-percent-of-the-world-relies-on-car-commutes-every-day/"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; heat up quickly, and warm liquid is a friendly environment for bacteria to multiply, even when the water originally started clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-daily-habits"&gt;What this means for daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no single number that tells you when an opened bottle becomes risky, since growth depends on temperature, time, and what entered the bottle in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest habit is simple: throw out a bottle that sat warm for hours, and refill a clean, reusable bottle with fresh, cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat and light also matter for unopened bottles. Long exposures in a hot car may not make water smell or taste different, yet the bottle can still shed particles under stress, as shown in the in-vehicle study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No plastic is perfect. Harder plastics are less likely to scuff, but wear and heat still degrade them over time, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-ultraviolet-light-can-be-used-to-destroy-covid-19/"&gt;ultraviolet light&lt;/a&gt; adds stress that accelerates the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want simple rules of thumb, keep water cold, avoid leaving bottles in cars, and replace scratched or old bottles. Stainless steel or glass containers remove the plastic variable, though they still need regular cleaning to keep microbes at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-water-bottles-and-false-claims"&gt;Plastic water bottles and false claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people worry that heating or freezing plastic bottles releases dioxins, which are cancer-causing pollutants from combustion. That claim does not apply to water bottles, a point long clarified in a Johns Hopkins interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are building better tools to count and identify the smallest particles in common beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laser based method that flagged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-normal-plastic-turns-into-dangerous-micro-and-nanoplastics/"&gt;nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; in bottled water is now being applied to tap water and even everyday activities like laundry, which release fibers into wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the microbe side, applied food safety research continues to test how temperature and time shape growth in opened drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work supports a few steady habits, chill your water, clean your bottles, and skip any container that got warm in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40652854/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Hazardous Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:40:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNlJtbkd6XzdCSDVHQmxTell5Z3dRbTFHd3VqUGVjMC1nOGNBZ3pEZVlIcXpxUVNySFdOQURJRnNMdW5FVEpPTEQ3NkZfa3oyQXE3QndiaFZxRUhIOExhWkowUFZsYV9JMjdmNzhNUlRQXzREdUtCOW9xd3RtRjFwMC1jMjNORC1ScTZXU2g5QlNfMDZLRkthdGhNaw</guid></item><item><title>已发现高血压与肠道健康之间存在深层联系： 3件可以最大限度地减少RIS的事情-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/a-deep-link-between-high-blood-pressure-and-gut-health-has-been-found-3-things-that-can-minimise-the-risk/articleshow/123661537.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was seen mainly as a problem of the heart and blood vessels. But recent research has uncovered an unexpected partner in this condition, the gut. Scientists have found that the trillions of microbes living inside the digestive tract, often called the gut microbiome, may play a role in raising or lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut produces beneficial compounds, regulates inflammation, and balances hormones. When this balance is disturbed, it may contribute to hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9863380/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;have linked an altered gut microbiome to increased risks of high blood pressure. This discovery opens a new window into prevention and management, one that begins from inside the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the gut matters in blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut is more than a digestion factory. It communicates with the brain, influences immune responses, and even helps regulate blood vessel function. When gut bacteria break down dietary fibre, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These compounds are known to relax blood vessels and reduce inflammation, both critical in keeping blood pressure stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, an unhealthy gut, rich in harmful bacteria and poor in diversity, can increase compounds that trigger inflammation and constrict blood vessels, silently pushing pressure upwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role makes the gut a key player in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking fibre; it’s not about quantity alone&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most health advice stops at “eat more fibre,” but the truth lies in the kind of fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268622/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;shows that soluble fibres, found in oats, apples, flaxseeds, and legumes, feed good bacteria more effectively than some rough insoluble fibres. Soluble fibre gets fermented in the colon, leading to the production of SCFAs that directly support blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about piling on bran flakes but rather about choosing fibres that nourish microbial diversity. Small swaps, such as replacing white rice with lentils or adding flaxseed to breakfast, can make a bigger difference than doubling the quantity of any fibre source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Timing of meals influences microbial rhythm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome doesn’t just care about what goes in, it also responds to when. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6533073/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;highlight that irregular eating patterns can disrupt the circadian rhythm of gut bacteria. This imbalance is associated with higher inflammation and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a consistent meal timing, even if meals are simple, supports microbial balance. Early dinners, for instance, give gut bacteria more time to complete their metabolic cycles overnight, lowering the strain on the heart and vessels. This perspective shifts the focus from “what to eat” to “when to eat,” a habit often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="20222666" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fermented-foods" source="keywords"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While probiotic capsules dominate conversations, naturally fermented foods like homemade curd, kanji, or pickles (except for some) offer a far richer spectrum of beneficial bacteria. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11500820/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that fermented dairy lowered blood pressure in hypertensive individuals by improving vascular elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods not only reintroduce diverse microbes into the gut but also deliver bioactive peptides that relax blood vessels. Adding a small bowl of curd daily, or sipping traditional ferments during meals, can create micro shifts that, over time, lower risks linked to hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace medical advice.

   &lt;p&gt;BOWMAN, N.D. — Retta Jacobi stepped onto a metal platform that lifted her to an entrance on the side of a custom-designed semitrailer. Once inside, she lay down on a platform that technicians slid into an MRI machine. Jacobi hoped the scan would help pinpoint the source of the pain in her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mobile MRI unit visits Southwest Healthcare Services, the hospital in Bowman, North Dakota, each Wednesday. Without it, the community's 1,400 residents would have to drive 40 minutes to get to an MRI machine, an expensive piece of medical equipment the hospital couldn't afford on its own.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Southwest Healthcare Services and 21 other independent, rural North Dakota hospitals are part of the Rough Rider Network, which used its members' combined patient rolls to negotiate better prices for the mobile imaging truck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Clinically integrated networks"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Independent rural hospitals are increasingly joining what are called clinically integrated networks, collaborative groups that allow them to avoid selling out to larger health systems while sharing resources to save money and improve patient care. Many are motivated by the chance to combine their patient rolls for &lt;a href="https://ruralhealthvalue.public-health.uiowa.edu/files/Intro_to_Rural_CINs.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;value-based care contracts&lt;/a&gt;, a growing reimbursement model in which insurers pay providers based on the quality of care they provide and the health outcomes of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Supporters of the networks are exploring whether funding from the $50 billion &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/rural-health-transformation-program-hospitals-medicaid-implementation-kansas/" target="_blank"&gt;Rural Health Transformation Program&lt;/a&gt; — part of President Donald Trump's recent tax and spending bill — can be used to help start or expand such organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For independent, rural hospitals, the networks are an alternative to shutting down or reducing services, or to giving up local autonomy and joining a large hospital system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anything that can help our rural hospitals and add services is awesome," said Jacobi, who provides speech therapy to children in the local school district.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Closing, or courting a big buyer&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, 153 rural hospitals in the U.S. have shuttered completely or stopped offering inpatient services, &lt;a href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. A far larger number, 441, merged with or were acquired by hospital systems between 2011 and 2021. That's &lt;a href="https://strengthenhealthcare.org/new-report-finds-integration-with-a-hospital-system-can-protect-rural-hospitals-patient-access-to-care/" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by the Coalition to Strengthen America's Healthcare, an advocacy group comprising hospitals and health associations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Rough Rider Network provides negotiating leverage to its members, which serve about two-thirds of rural North Dakotans, said Dennis Goebel, CEO of the Bowman hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care vendors "probably wouldn't be talking to us if we're by ourselves," he said. "They're not looking for the little, tiny crumbs. They want a big contract, and they'll give you better pricing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some rural networks share specialists who aren't needed full time at any one hospital, according to &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2023/may/how-regional-partnerships-bolster-rural-hospitals" target="_blank"&gt;the Commonwealth Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit focused on improving the health care system. Some networks also invest in broadband, housing, and other community development projects that can help people stay healthy and access care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A business to create new networks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hospitals can pool staffers for a network-wide employee health insurance plan, said Nathan White, CEO of Cibolo Health, a company that helps launch and manage networks in rural areas. He said they can also enter shared contracts for telehealth, prescription drug programs, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;White said he started Cibolo Health after a leader from an independent, rural North Dakota hospital asked him about collaborating with similar facilities. The Rough Rider Network launched in late 2023 with assistance from the company and $3.5 million from the North Dakota Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, Cibolo Health has helped start networks in Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, and Ohio. Once a sixth one opens in September, Cibolo-affiliated networks will represent more than 120 hospitals, with service areas covering 4.7 million people, White said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The networks, which are nonprofits owned by the hospitals, pay an annual fee to Cibolo Health, a for-profit company, for management services. White said leaders from 10 other states are considering joining this model.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Similar networks have been around for more than 30 years but became more popular after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA370-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report&lt;/a&gt; by the Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Rural health care providers are increasingly interested in forming such networks, said Marnell Bradfield, executive director of the Community Care Alliance, a network of hospitals and independent primary care offices that launched in 2015 in rural western Colorado. About once a month, she said, she gets a call from health care leaders exploring similar networks and asking about her experience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Rand Corp. wrote in its 2020 paper that it didn't find any academic studies that examined whether these networks do what its supporters claim — save money and improve patient care.&lt;br&gt;"In theory, quality should improve with the alignment of health care organizations, but there is no evidence," the report said. The paper also said such networks could end up increasing prices, something that can occur with traditional mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bradfield and White said they have the evidence, at least for their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Community Care Alliance members have reduced their insurance costs while improving patient outcomes, such as reducing their need for inpatient and emergency care, Bradfield said.&lt;br&gt;White said data from a pilot program between Caret Health, a care coordination company, and SMP Health-St. Kateri, one of Rough Rider's hospitals, showed the program helped a significant number of patients catch up with preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86672" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Reaching out to patients, bringing in business&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gabby Wilkie, finance director at the St. Kateri hospital, in Rolla, N.D., near the Canadian border, said Caret Health staff called and texted patients who were behind on annual physicals, cancer screenings, vaccinations, and other visits. She said staffers explained to patients why this preventive care is important for their health before setting up a three-way call with St. Kateri staff to schedule an appointment. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;White said it took an average of 11 outreach attempts before patients came in for any visits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To be honest, we didn't have the resources to reach out," Wilkie said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She said St. Kateri would have spent an estimated $300,000 to do that kind of outreach for 1,000 patients. Meanwhile, she said, the hospital estimates it will earn more than $100,000 when that many patients come in for their preventive care. Cibolo Health and the Rough Rider Network both contribute to the cost of the Caret Health service, which is now rolling out to other network hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goebel said joining a network to remain independent is also beneficial for the economy of rural areas, where hospitals are often major employers. He said health systems sometimes cut services and staff at rural hospitals they acquire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jacobi is taking medication and doing physical therapy after a doctor examined her MRI results. If that doesn't work, she may need to make a five-hour round trip to Bismarck to get an ultrasound-guided steroid shot. Jacobi was thankful she could get a diagnosis and treatment advice without having to travel far for the MRI.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anytime we can maintain more local control, it's a good thing for our small towns," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Spousal correlations for nine &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; are consistent across cultures and persistent over generations," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a large-scale analysis to quantify spousal correlations across nine psychiatric disorders and to test cultural and generational stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohorts included approximately five million spousal pairs in Taiwan, 571,534 pairs in Denmark, and published estimates from 707,263 pairs in Sweden, comprising 14.8 million individuals, with up to six million matched controls. Case counts across cohorts ranged from 1.4 million for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depressive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt; to 31,195 for anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Taiwanese couples, spousal resemblance appeared positive for every disorder pair, and estimates largely aligned with Nordic registry patterns aside from anorexia nervosa, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obsessive+compulsive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and bipolar disorder, which diverged across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Generational patterns in Taiwan showed multiple substance use disorder combinations rising by birth cohort, while obsessive compulsive disorder matched within spouses declined. Sex-specific differences appeared limited, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder fluctuated without a study-defined trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent–offspring resemblance tracked these shifts, rising for major depressive disorder and substance use disorder and falling for obsessive compulsive disorder across birth cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family risk increased when both parents shared a diagnosis for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic covariance signals aligned with these observations, with spousal resemblance correlating with Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) derived heritability and genetic correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate positive spousal resemblance across all nine psychiatric disorders in Taiwan, culturally consistent with Nordic estimates for most disorders and distinct for anorexia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generational patterns in Taiwan persist across cohorts, aligning with elevated offspring risk when both parents have diagnoses and arguing for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic studies&lt;/a&gt;, including GWAS, to account for non-random mating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While genetics and environmental factors are typically considered to be underlying psychiatric disorders, the discovery of assortative mating adds another layer to both the genetic and developmental upbringing environment roles in acquiring a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we proudly stand alongside every heroic American mother, grandmother, sister, and daughter who is courageously battling ovarian cancer.  We solemnly remember the cherished loved ones whose lives were tragically cut short by this devastating disease.  Above all, we recommit to eradicating all forms of cancer, and to building a healthier, stronger, and more vigorous American future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration remains determined to ensuring that future generations live free from all forms of cancer.  For this reason, I established the Make America Healthy Again commission, tasked with addressing the root causes of diseases like ovarian cancer.  Additionally, we have taken decisive action to ensure transparency in healthcare pricing, lower the cost of prescription drugs, expand access to telehealth, and give terminally ill patients the right to try experimental drugs that could save their lives—ensuring that women who are battling ovarian cancer have the vital support and resources they need to successfully battle and conquer their disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month, our Nation unites in prayer and resolves to defeat ovarian cancer—and to bring hope, healing, and comfort to every patient and family suffering from it.  Together, with the incredible work of scientists, researchers, and medical professionals, we will forge a future free from the ravages of cancer, and we will make America healthier and greater than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A dangerous, sometimes deadly, infection spread by kissing bugs is regularly spreading within America. In a recent paper, researchers are claiming that Chagas disease is endemic to parts of the southern U.S. and is probably here to stay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Florida, Texas, and California made the case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. Citing evidence from infected humans, animals, and kissing bugs, they argue that Chagas has established a persistent presence in the country, albeit at low levels. Correctly recognizing that Chagas is endemic, they say, will allow us to better combat the infectious disease, which can cause chronic heart problems if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The kissing bug disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html"&gt;Chagas&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, and the infection is spread by various species of kissing bugs, or triatomines. As their nickname implies, kissing bugs feed by sucking blood from around a host’s mouth (or sometimes eyes). The bugs usually infect people via the poop they leave behind near a bite wound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People infected with the parasite can first experience an acute phase of flu-like illness, after which the infection enters a chronic phase if left untreated. Most people avoid any symptoms in either phase, but up to a third of people with chronic Chagas disease will eventually experience serious health problems, such as an enlarged heart and colon. People can also die from heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest as a result of the infection. It can take years and even decades for these chronic symptoms to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 8 million people worldwide are thought to have Chagas, including 280,000 in the United States. Most of these U.S. cases were caught elsewhere, particularly in parts of Central and South America where &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; is locally circulating. But the researchers present evidence that the parasite has probably made a cozy home within the southern U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why Chagas should be seen as endemic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, there have likely been locally acquired (autochthonous) human cases of Chagas documented in at least eight states, including Texas, California, and Florida. These cases are typically found in people with no relevant travel history or other risk factor for having caught the parasite outside of the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000651958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651958" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000651958" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1.jpg" alt="24 1700 F1" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1.jpg 900w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-336x206.jpg 336w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-768x471.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-672x412.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651958" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A map showing where the Chagas parasite has been found in local human, animal, and kissing bug populations. © Beatty, et al/Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers additionally note that southern U.S. states are known to have several kissing bug species that can theoretically carry and transmit the &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; parasite, including species that will regularly invade human dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And studies have detected the parasite circulating among local kissing bug populations. Just last July, for example, researchers &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/kissing-bugs-are-creeping-into-florida-homes-and-theyre-carrying-a-dangerous-parasite-2000627551"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that a third of kissing bugs collected in Florida carried the parasite. The parasite has also been &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-013120-043949"&gt;commonly found&lt;/a&gt; in local wildlife, captive animals, and pets (dogs in particular), providing a reservoir for it to survive in the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these bits of data together point to a single conclusion. “&lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; and the ecologic conditions that sustain its transmission cycles are naturally occurring throughout the southern half of the United States,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low-level but persistent threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one silver lining is that Chagas is likely hypoendemic to the southern U.S., the researchers say, meaning it’s only present in low levels. But as things stand now, we’re largely fighting blind against it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chagas disease in people is not a nationally notifiable condition, so doctors in most places aren’t obligated to report cases to their health departments, the researchers point out. It is notifiable in some of the states where local cases have been found, but not all (in California, only two counties require notice).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While Chagas might not be as huge an issue in the U.S. as it is in other parts of the Americas, classifying it as endemic will allow scientists to better track its distribution and range, the researchers say. Improved awareness of the disease will also make it easier for infected people to get the timely care they need before their infection turns into something more serious and potentially life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;There are regions where an atypically large number of people enjoy a much longer lifespan than elsewhere on the planet. In these so-called Blue Zones—such as Ogliastra in Italy, Ikaria in Greece, Okinawa in Japan, and Martinique—the population tends to eat healthy, stay physically active, engage with a community, and live with a sense of purpose. (Why are we surprised they live longer, again?).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has investigated how these Blue Zone lifestyle principles apply in four Western Finland regions—Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia, Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia, Swedish-speaking Åland, and Finnish-speaking South Ostrobothnia. The new research highlights a potential new Blue Zone but also more broadly reveals that longevity in Nordic regions isn’t necessarily associated with the Blue Zone lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The potential coherence between longevity, health and lifestyle may vary in different cultural, political, social and economic contexts,” the researchers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/jare/5535904"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the Journal of Aging Research. “The present study aims to examine if adherence to Blue Zone lifestyle principles and good health is highest in the most longevous region.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blue Zone principles don’t always apply&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By analyzing survey data from the Gerontological Regional Database from 2021 and 2022, the researchers found that Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia hits most of the Blue Zone checkmarks with its population’s long life expectancy, good health, and Blue Zone lifestyle. Interestingly, Åland does not meet all the Blue Zone lifestyle principles and yet is Finland’s most longevous region. It scored higher in environmental agreeableness and had the healthiest population among the regions studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, South Ostrobothnia, along with Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia, most closely followed the Blue Zone lifestyle, and yet had the poorest health and lowest life expectancy of the studied regions. Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia demonstrated the fewest Blue Zone lifestyle principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t pinpoint clear reasons for the regional differences in how longevity, health, and lifestyle are connected. But it shows that Blue Zone principles don’t strictly define Finland’s most longevous region—though the country may still host a newly described Blue Zone in Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, “we require additional demographic studies to verify the extraordinary life expectancy in Ostrobothnia, especially among the Swedish-speaking community,” Sarah Åkerman, co-author of the study and principal investigator of Åbo Akademi University’s Blue Zones in the Nordics project, said in a university &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-potential-blue-zone-region-finland.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long healthspan is the goal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Åkerman and her colleagues also point out that longevity doesn’t necessarily mean good health or a healthy lifestyle. We’ve all heard about the friend-of-a-friend’s 98-year-old grandmother who’s been smoking 15 cigarettes a day for seven decades. My own grandmother is 94 years old, rarely leaves her armchair, and drinks a hefty glass of red wine with almost all of her meals (she claims her doctor prescribes it, but we’re obviously skeptical).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you’re hoping for a long life, however, I think it’s safe to say that you shouldn’t bank on being like these grandmas. Plus, people have become increasingly interested in more than just long lives—the new holy grail now is long &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2025/01/14/what-is-healthspan-and-how-can-you-maximize-yours"&gt;healthspans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            For Henry Cockburn, the onset of schizophrenia felt like pure common sense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe600063b6nzs5h14lj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was February 2002, and the 20-year-old art student had strayed from the University of Brighton to satisfy his desire for a life of magic outside the city. He also wanted to take a 70-mile journey (about 113 kilometers) barefoot back to his childhood home in Canterbury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe600073b6n00ts3j74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 15 miles (24 kilometers) into his walk, he heard planes in the distance, and told CNN he believed “that somehow an evil force knew I had left.” Cockburn knew with absolute certainty that he was being followed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe700083b6nwwbt4s66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The solution, he believed, was to dive into the frigid tidal waters of the Newhaven Estuary and swim away from the malevolent presence. Fishermen found him and rescued him just before he blacked out from hypothermia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe700093b6nolph6xmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After being revived in a general hospital, he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia. The institution was the first of several where he would spend the next eight years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Schizophrenia is simultaneously one of the most famous mental illnesses and one of the most misunderstood. Affecting &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fnews-room%2Ffact-sheets%2Fdetail%2Fschizophrenia&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571584505%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=KpvCnrRSI%2B7QDRdAjg7KgE7PmaVm1leGfUR%2FIZIQMz4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;0.32% of the global population&lt;/a&gt;, or around 24 million people, schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder often marked by psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, lack of motivation, and disorganized thinking and speech, according to the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychiatry.org%2Fpatients-families%2Fschizophrenia%2Fwhat-is-schizophrenia&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571600929%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=WgJ56bMFUnfjusypugqW7SAmlCilCToWlK660XCZfi4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;American Psychiatric Association&lt;/a&gt;. Cockburn’s case reflects a typical pattern of onset: in early adulthood, a psychological break into false beliefs, hallucinations and paranoia, all of which escalate over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesxssze00003b6nt7c6rlqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I saw it as more of a spiritual awakening and not paranoid schizophrenia,” Cockburn recalled. “It almost felt like I was on the run, and if you’re part of the system and you take yourself out of the system, the system doesn’t like that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000g3b6n3jvr49t6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was kind of cross and angry, like, ‘Why can’t people understand me?’” Cockburn added. “I can sort of see their point of view a bit more now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Part of the confusion about schizophrenia may originate from the name of the disorder itself. Coined by Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Paul Eugen Bleuler in 1908, “schizophrenia” derives from the Greek words “schizo,” meaning “split,” and “phrene,” or “mind.” To describe the severe social withdrawal of some patients with schizophrenia, Bleuler also &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC3757918%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571633403%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=vWvd4%2BfTUPhlByN0FCoBtiI3OAr%2Fta%2FjPVRRKmotu48%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;devised the term “autism&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the early 20th century, Bleuler proposed that the disorder was marked by a “splitting of psychological functions” by which “the personality loses its unity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000j3b6n8xg8ojaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea that schizophrenia means a split mind has contributed to a widespread belief in more formal contexts that the condition is like &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F9792-dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571651706%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=lOduwMGjdvmJ3YeelW8YC2tPcUqY0Rk%2Fde39LwsikEc%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;dissociative identity disorder&lt;/a&gt;, previously called split or multiple personality disorder, said Dr. Daniel Weinberger, director and CEO of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. Dissociative identity disorder, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F9792-dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571670477%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=%2BjtrkyrqeyIreg40OenJw7bFM75hodlCQkwHmWLIPzY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;caused by trauma&lt;/a&gt;, is when two or more distinctive personalities control a person’s behavior, causing gaps in memory when the personalities switch off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000k3b6nfqf8wqzc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond those misperceptions about its underlying nature, schizophrenia is one of the most heavily stigmatized mental health disorders, said Dr. Deepak D’Souza, Vikram Sodhi ’92 Professor of Psychiatry and director of the Schizophrenia Neuropharmacology Research Group at Yale University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000l3b6nkf1dxow0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a widespread stereotype that people with schizophrenia are a threat to others — “the homeless person walking barefoot in the winter screaming at no one in particular (or the) mass murderer compelled by their symptoms to kill strangers,” said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, the Lawrence C. Kolb Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000m3b6njg2nu3t6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s the condition that people “associate with madness and psychosis and lunacy,” said Lieberman, who is the author of “&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Malady-of-the-Mind/Jeffrey-A-Lieberman/9781982136420" target="_blank"&gt;Malady of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;: Schizophrenia and the Path to Prevention.” While some of these stereotypes are based in true symptoms that some patients experience, they aren’t reflective of all patients and can prevent a holistic, compassionate view of schizophrenia as a treatable disorder that’s usually more harmful to the patient than to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000n3b6nxtszvbc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way society has dealt with it — from ancient times through medieval times, even until the 21st century — is to ostracize or segregate people with these severe mental disorders,” Lieberman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000o3b6nmgh3rf57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To make matters worse, among people who don’t have schizophrenia, there’s also the popular colloquial use of “schizophrenic” or “schizo” to describe feeling self-contradictory or frazzled by having multiple stressors or responsibilities simultaneously.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000p3b6ni4ir2zil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misperceptions and fears about schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to recognize its signs and seek help for themselves or others, experts say. That help is critical since the disorder is associated with co-occurring mental health issues, a lower quality of life and life expectancy, and higher rates of disability, according to the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nimh.nih.gov%2Fhealth%2Fstatistics%2Fschizophrenia&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571686990%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=v9XMvTZvvOYxdtxfK3G9YHwWYhLGOAMvLXqiESmGg7g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.

            Accordingly, among some experts there &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.schres.2021.08.034&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571703302%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=LlAVt2yAt1fuVBw%2BCaAkyicilSO%2BAdwy%2FGD3TO%2Fy4j4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;is growing interest&lt;/a&gt; in changing the name of this chronic brain disorder.

            Symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 25, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000s3b6nzszqqjkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People might have been doing OK or even great in their lives, and then suddenly they have what experts call a “first break” in their capacity to function normally, said Weinberger, also a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetic medicine at the Johns Hopkins University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmexb7lmf00003b6nw96nrjy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To me, (schizophrenia) is the most devastating of mental illnesses — because it strikes before a person reaches their potential,” D’Souza said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000t3b6nq1ujl03q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research suggests this disruption may stem from alterations in normal &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC3080672%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571735713%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=PEZbs4WQhXgiX8XTRixOaion2YeqV4bQF3gLReQ8SAI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;neurodevelopmental processes&lt;/a&gt; that happen as adolescents mature — especially since the higher end of the typical age range of onset is when the brain completes maturation, D’Souza said. But for some people, the stage for such changes may be set as early as infancy and require 20 years of brain maturation for the effects to become obvious, Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000u3b6nqviqf69o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are forms of schizophrenia that can begin earlier, but it’s rare, D’Souza said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000v3b6n37ic7uzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schizophrenia predominantly occurs in males, he added. Still, “there’s an interesting second peak in the rates of schizophrenia that occurs &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC5688947%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571752085%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=8jk8C7sqfFG%2BtPemeMQYktiNlHoc7Zvat6yRzNM4%2BCA%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;in the early 50s&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s predominantly among women,” D’Souza said. “It’s thought to be related to menopause.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000w3b6n79jfrcvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What directly causes schizophrenia isn’t clear, but there are several known risk factors, Weinberger said. Those include brain chemistry and genetics that increase the likelihood that, with enough risk factors accumulated, someone will develop the disorder. Many neuroimaging studies have also shown structural abnormalities in the brains of people with schizophrenia, but nothing consistent enough across patient populations to become signature features of the disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A pregnancy complicated by factors such as preeclampsia, prolonged labor or low birth weight can double a child’s risk, Weinberger said. Stress and trauma can also &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fschizophrenia%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20354443&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571768194%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=uoysOQ8ur7WiN1nDYKvZ92VwBJGLFVB0pCmet1Ojm8A%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;increase one’s likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia.

            Taking mind-altering drugs as a teen or young adult is another risk factor, and researchers have increasingly been finding associations between &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F07%2F22%2Fhealth%2Fmarijuana-schizophrenia-study-wellness&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571784439%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=jeCN1eKgPZOtA4eoSb%2Fn8B284EK7rojYJ9IKRTT8QEs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;cannabis use and schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.

            When Cockburn was diagnosed after his swimming episode at age 20, he had just quit using marijuana about four days weekly and alcohol two or three days weekly since he was 14 years old, he said. Cockburn doesn’t think drug use caused his schizophrenia, but he had also started behaving unusually — walking barefoot in the winter — before he got sober.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The system is not there to facilitate getting high, D’Souza said, but to help regulate the levels and activities of neurotransmitters that affect our mood, learning, body temperature and more. It also has a critical role in neurodevelopment, controlling where some neurons migrate to, which ones are removed and whether any are unhealthily disrupted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00123b6nqow7xefs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

That’s the compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the major active ingredient in cannabis thought to be responsible for the psychoactive effects of use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00133b6neygpzmma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weinberger thinks the cannabis-schizophrenia research is controversial, as cause and effect can’t be inferred from associations, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00143b6n61bpjaiw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the idea isn’t a new one, D’Souza said, citing 19th-century work by French psychiatrist Dr. Jacques Joseph Moreau. Moreau detailed &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2FS0074774206780102&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571869359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=bC0e5M068fKdsvOvCQWEvtvkMjej4zk4FByOCuLIGak%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;users of hashish&lt;/a&gt; experiencing delusions, hallucinations and paranoia — all things now associated with schizophrenia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00153b6no5aybxmg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several categories of schizophrenia symptoms, and they can affect how people feel, think and act.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00163b6nzl3engxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Delusions, or believing in things that aren’t true or real, and acting on them are common. They can be “extremely unsettling, tormenting and very disabling,” Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00173b6npjjy8rdd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Someone with delusions may think the Central Intelligence Agency has infiltrated their phone to spy on them, Weinberger said, and thus remove the phone’s battery. Cockburn said that this past spring, he was reading the C.S. Lewis novel “The Magician’s Nephew” and became fascinated with Aslan the lion’s ability to sing the world of Narnia into creation from a dark void.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00183b6nh455wtx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought that was how the world began,” Cockburn said. “I read fantasy books and then look for the fantasy within the reality of this world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00193b6nf68lkb2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cockburn also felt that plants and birds could talk to him, and that he could “converse with the spirits,” he added. A conversation with a tree had a big impact on him: “It told me I could rap, and that’s what I started getting into after that happened.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001a3b6nauvdhbuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During some of Cockburn’s escapes from psychiatric hospitals — a habit that led to admission to five or six mental hospitals over those eight years — he would strip naked and explore a forest on a snowy day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001b3b6n3wqhrwf2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations, such as talking to someone who isn’t there, Weinberger said. Cockburn sometimes saw snipers outside the window of his hospital room, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001c3b6n1k0689y7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Delusions and hallucinations can lead to fear and paranoia, Weinberger said. That paranoia can make patients think others are talking about them, plotting against them, or affecting or reading the thoughts in their own brains — which “makes them very uncomfortable in public settings, because they feel they’re not safe,” he added. “Most individuals with schizophrenia are much more likely to feel that they’re unsafe than they are to make you feel that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001d3b6nqqmsac3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hallucinations also commonly take the form of voices that can sometimes start out benign and darken over time, experts said. Many patients often hear multiple voices carrying on a conversation about them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001e3b6nzye18ybk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When voices told Cockburn that “there was no redemption for me,” he recalled, “I would have really bad days where I felt I was being sucked into a godless world, I suppose, and my mood would go down.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4mrai000e3b6n8z0vexpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Voices can also command someone to perform actions that are difficult to resist, even when they’re self-destructive, Weinberger said. Probably &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC1845151%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571902845%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XGNr5U%2Fzr5lOYKH0VmiOBY5kn4BvrapBnOHwL%2BF8gCs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;5% to 13%&lt;/a&gt; of patients die by suicide, and sometimes that’s due to following hallucinated orders to perform lethal actions, Weinberger added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4nhe6001n3b6nldk9bnu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In neuroimaging studies of patients hearing voices, “areas of the brain that are responsible for language and speech generation are lighting up,” D’Souza explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4n8uk001l3b6nvjizbke9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People with schizophrenia can have cognitive deficits such as difficulty creating and following a plan, processing complicated information, or using information to reach appropriate conclusions, Weinberger said. Disorganized speech, unusual movements and a lack of motivation are other common symptoms — as is social isolation, which Cockburn had begun to exhibit before his first hospitalization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001s3b6n8g6ol62f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Schizophrenia is a very disabling problem,” Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001u3b6n8o6ej7qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schizophrenia cannot be cured, Lieberman said, but it can be substantially alleviated with a combination of &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fschizophrenia%2Fdiagnosis-treatment%2Fdrc-20354449&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571918664%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=KMJWkIWl6NujfqBQwnhFHzl9LNqwHTo%2FdCnEOlycvOU%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;medications and therapies&lt;/a&gt; — though accessing multidisciplinary care and getting insurance to cover it remain difficult, even for the health care providers wanting to provide such resources for their patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001v3b6nc7zxsbtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most effective drugs for patients are antipsychotics, Lieberman said, since those medications &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2F24692-antipsychotic-medications&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571934565%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=3H%2BoXTCAjLn9JW6U%2Fo4qZSBvPdWY%2FbmEbd8QnZAj8CQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;manage the elements&lt;/a&gt; of psychosis that impair thoughts and perceptions. The cognitive difficulties are harder to treat, Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001w3b6n0b6gj7c4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time, Weinberger added, the greatest treatment obstacle is patients not taking their medications — sometimes due to anosognosia, the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nami.org%2Fabout-mental-illness%2Fcommon-with-mental-illness%2Fanosognosia%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571950457%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=UBbhP1AzDrpTynnKRPOWUjDQRZ1HDFlDztAM5M2%2Bp1U%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;unawareness of being ill&lt;/a&gt;, which affects 50% to 98% of people with schizophrenia. Other times, nonadherence results from the medicine’s uncomfortable side effects. But now that experts better understand some causal factors of schizophrenia, other drugs &lt;a href="https://info.thelancet.com/e3t/Ctc/RF+113/cs6tF04/VWCXBV8mKV--W6svZxF4Jd0c9W2F3lfm5xBfCFN2dmMxz3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3psW7bcCBD1_xCl7W20wsmb2lm2LsW7MT-KL5DGNmxN6PyNNBQpdYnW8LB7ns30JNBhW1pHHmb7nb4GTW1Qyjrp5YMkCCW1ZcDn95TNNFqN675bf231m84W2_9C7k9kWWytW4L7BL75kV9nSW3Hk8Jb6_FtfgN1TFFq1fbrP9W4RpS0934t9n4W2N003_5k3jPNW1gM1lV4z6KyzW8S7ylF42-k44W17BztH4qjV7XW1q_ZK04G3jqqW4tnFW98xT6_HVJkz1h3x4XXNW3WNZVX5qpbHbW7M4VqG88JRLKW5B9Nxx2pX94nN6MDzLQFtT0qW5mwJKX4GhLPSW8trjhr4kw0ngW3vb4b76MvtH3f18-80C04" target="_blank"&gt;currently being studied&lt;/a&gt; or developed should be much more effective with fewer side effects, Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Effective therapies include talk therapy, social skills training and &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mountsinai.org%2Fcare%2Fpsychiatry%2Fservices%2Fschizophrenia%2Ftreatment%2Fcbtp&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571967416%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=Lhk2mwc4BDGmyj6eilkRjvYmlonHZRyDhztiSJZgn5s%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; for psychosis, Weinberger and D’Souza said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;With comprehensive treatment, patients can learn to dismiss or respond to urges or voices in healthier ways.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001y3b6ndprqiuu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since Cockburn was discharged from his last hospital in 2011, he has largely accomplished just this, thanks to CBT for psychosis, medications and counseling. Just before his interview with CNN, he had gone on a run. He felt something beyond himself urging him to run further than he usually does, but instead of obeying, he turned around, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001z3b6nfe46ds3z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I felt a little bit guilt-ridden for it,” Cockburn said. “But then as I got towards the end of the run, I realized that I wouldn’t have been able to finish it if I hadn’t turned back at that moment. I guess common sense got the better of me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch00203b6ns9cq17r4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dating is nonexistent for Cockburn, he said, but he has close friends and family and lives with a roommate in England. He’s on government disability benefits, but also sometimes makes a living from his paintings. He still gets panic attacks occasionally, but the comforting stillness of sitting in a dark, cool room helps them pass. Cockburn has also finished his bachelor’s degree and tries to dwell more on the good in life than the bad.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch00213b6ne0j9whyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2011, he cowrote a memoir with his father, journalist Patrick Cockburn, titled “&lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHenrys-Demons-Father-Journey-Madness%2Fdp%2F1439154716&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571985453%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=1mIJqQnER2W2RufpKnh5v60B6QImLKfDdX6t1h2h27g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Henry’s Demons&lt;/a&gt;: A Father and Son’s Journey Out of Madness.” The book was shortlisted for a prize by the now-defunct Costa Book Awards and dramatized into a radio &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fprogrammes%2Fb0150mld&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432572002687%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=wTFFGnnik5svzz2sWGeQoSJl8m47EE%2FznuGsKvsSkhs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;play for BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;.

Even things that would have once made me roll my eyes. Chromotherapy, sound baths, mushroom extract. Reiki, leg compression boots, strategic humming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If the devil (hopefully the Liz Hurley Bedazzled version) offered me full health in exchange for my soul, I would have a hard time saying no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And so, I am an easy target. I have become a selectively gullible person – disillusioned with mainstream medicine, waiting for a cure, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of an infrared light panel wearing nothing but a pair of protective wraparound sunglasses and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I contracted Covid-19 at a Harry Styles concert in June 2022. Three months later, I was diagnosed with post-Covid-19 syndrome, colloquially known as long Covid because, well, it does like to hang around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2ccfb5f6-a352-4339-8128-b5c1c8345fc2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Walking my dog, I feel free to wear the most unhinged outfits – and nobody minds","elementId":"2ccfb5f6-a352-4339-8128-b5c1c8345fc2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/06/walking-my-dog-i-feel-free-to-wear-the-most-unhinged-outfits-and-nobody-minds"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since then, I have sampled from the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;200+ available symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including but not limited to heart palpitations, gastrointestinal chaos, joint pain, the ability to feel my heartbeat in my arms, brain fog so bad I once forgot how to turn off the shower and the type of fatigue that regularly makes me Google “can you die from tiredness”. At times, a five-minute phone conversation has sent me to bed for days. I’d have to rest halfway up a small set of stairs. I’d answer a single email then slip into a sleep that felt much closer to a coma than a nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When things are that grim, the promises made by the wellness industry sound very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; appealing. An industry worth &lt;a href="https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$6.3tn globally&lt;/a&gt;, with some of the most diabolically persuasive advocates available – celebrities, influencers, internet strangers, a friend’s sister’s boyfriend’s colleague who swears this one supplement made him better in a week. I shudder to think what my own contribution to that figure has been – and I will not be voluntarily doing maths to find out. I’ve been through enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whenever someone recommends something new, I haven’t had it in me to ask “where’s the rigorous scientific proof of this thing’s efficacy?” when I’ve had “help me! I will do anything to feel well” playing inside my head on a loop for thousands of days. Sometimes this is fine, even great – there are many alternative things that really work for me – I love my acupuncturist! Somatic dance! Shiatsu!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other times, it’s been more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the screening call for a wellness program I now believe to be at best a pyramid scheme, at worst a cult, I was asked if I felt able to “put aside” my “critical thinking” before they signed me up. I practically begged them to let me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs.

I had found the limit of my wilful gullibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I found it again by accidentally taking part in a ceremony to commune with angels because it was advertised as a nice relaxing group meditation.

Now I feel extremely protective of other people like me, too sick to necessarily have the clarity of mind to tell the false promises of wellness culture from the legit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What else? I’ve done 90-minute sessions lying in a sealed hyperbaric oxygen chamber, which felt somewhat like road-testing my own coffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A small, frighteningly positive man poked my spine and pulled my arms and pummelled my back while he bellowed things like “your immune system works perfectly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs. Sweated in saunas. Let a man strike a drum balanced on my belly so the vibrations would stimulate my cells. Stirred mushroom powders into hot water for an alleged boost to my cognitive function.

I down a pint of water and electrolytes. Place a little device that looks like a high-end sex toy on my sternum to stimulate my vagus nerve. Stand on a vibration plate to move muscles that may otherwise atrophy after roughly 900 days of lying down. Dance aggressively to a Selena Gomez-heavy playlist to release trapped emotion from my body. Put my legs up a wall at every possible opportunity. And guzzle a handful of supplements, thinking to myself, &lt;em&gt;at the very least, maybe I can have some placebo effect, as a little treat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Do I think these things have helped? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Am I sure about that? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what else can I do? There is no treatment protocol, no known cure for long Covid.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Trinity College Dublin have discovered that electrically stimulating macrophages—one of the immune systems key players—can reprogram them in such a way as to reduce inflammation and encourage faster, more effective healing in disease and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This breakthrough uncovers a potentially powerful new therapeutic option, with further work ongoing to delineate the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages are a type of white blood cell with several high-profile roles in our immune system. They patrol around the body, surveying for bugs and viruses, as well as disposing of dead and damaged cells, and stimulating other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;—kicking them into gear when and where they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their actions can also drive local inflammation in the body, which can sometimes get out of control and become problematic, causing more damage to the body than repair. This is present in lots of different diseases, highlighting the need to regulate macrophages for improved patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Physical Science&lt;/i&gt;, the Trinity team worked with human macrophages isolated from healthy donor blood samples provided via the Irish Blood Transfusion Board, St James's Hospital. They stimulated these cells using a custom bioreactor to apply electrical currents and measured what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists discovered that this stimulation caused a shift of macrophages into an anti-inflammatory state that supports faster tissue repair; a decrease in inflammatory marker (signaling) activity; an increase in expression of genes that promote the formation of new blood vessels (associated with tissue repair as new tissues form); and an increase in stem cell recruitment into wounds (also associated with tissue repair).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We have known for a very long time that the immune system is vital for repairing damage in our body and that macrophages play a central role in fighting infection and guiding &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tissue+repair/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tissue repair&lt;/a&gt;," said Dr. Sinead O'Rourke, Research Fellow in Trinity's School of Biochemistry and Immunology, and first author of the research article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a result, many scientists are exploring ways to 'reprogram' macrophages to encourage faster, more effective healing in disease and to limit the unwanted side effects that come with overly aggressive inflammation. And while there is growing evidence that electrical stimulation may help control how different cells behave during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wound+healing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wound healing&lt;/a&gt;, very little was known about how it affects human macrophages prior to this work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are really excited by the findings. Not only does this study show for the first time that electrical stimulation can shift human macrophages to suppress inflammation, we have also demonstrated the increased ability of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/macrophages/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; to repair tissue, supporting electrical stimulation as an exciting new therapy to boost the body's own repair processes in a huge range of different injury and disease situations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from the interdisciplinary team led by Trinity investigators, Professor Aisling Dunne (School of Biochemistry and Immunology) and Professor Michael Monaghan (School of Engineering) are especially significant given that this work was performed with human blood cells (showing its effectiveness in real patients). Electrical stimulation is relatively safe and easy in the scheme of therapeutic options, and the outcomes should be applicable to a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author Prof. Monaghan added, "Among the future steps are to explore more advanced regimes of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrical+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical stimulation&lt;/a&gt; to generate more precise and prolonged effects on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory cells&lt;/a&gt; and to explore new materials and modalities of delivering electric fields. This concept has yielded compelling effects in vitro and has huge potential in a wide range of inflammatory diseases."&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it's a deadline at work, a difficult-conversation, or just trying to stay on top of daily tasks, pressure is inevitable and along with pressure comes undulating stress. We all try to address stress through the big-ticket items, like sleep, exercise, or meditation. But there is one little habit that may be influencing how we respond to stress more than we know — 'staying properly hydrated'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study indicates that even mild dehydration may put a stress burden on the body, making you more likely to develop long-term health problems. It's a reminder that hydration is not merely about quenching our thrist but also it helps calm our minds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/news/articles/2025/8/22/dehydration-and-stress-study" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Liverpool John Moores University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (LJMU) recently investigated the relationship between &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00408.2025" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;hydration and stress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the impact of fluid consumption on cortisol, the key stress hormone in the body. They discovered that individuals who consumed less than 1.5 litres of fluid per day, about the level found in seven cups of tea, had a cortisol increase that was more than 50 percent greater when stressed compared to individuals consuming sufficient water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because prolonged high levels of cortisol are associated with serious health issues, such as heart disease, diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study entail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain a better idea, scientists categorized healthy young adults according to their typical daily fluid consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one group, people had less than 1.5 litres of fluid regularly. The other group maintained the recommended daily levels of 2 litres for women and 2.5 litres for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one week, the participants maintained their regular consumption of alcohol while providing blood and urine samples for the measurement of hydration status. They were then requested to undertake a test of stress by undergoing a simulated job interview and solving mental arithmetic questions under time constraints at the conclusion of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though both groups were equally anxious and their heart rate responded similarly to the test, the group that consumed less water had a more intense cortisol response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important to our health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol isn't entirely an evil-stress hormone, it assists the body in reacting to immediate danger as well. However, when cortisol remains elevated too frequently, it can be more harm than help. Chronic elevation of stress hormones is associated with a multitude of medical conditions, including high blood pressure, weight gain, mood disorders, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained by Professor Neil Walsh, the lead researcher, "Cortisol is the body's main stress hormone and heightened cortisol reactivity to stress is related to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more surprisingly, the under-hydrated individuals did not perceive themselves as thirstier than the hydrated group. Their only true indication of dehydration was in their urine, which was more concentrated. This indicates that we cannot trust only thirst to inform us that we need additional water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much to drink?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily recommended intake is approximately 2 litres for women and 2.5 litres for men. This may consist of water and also fluid from tea, coffee, and other beverages. High water content foods like fruits and vegetables contribute to fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick is to notice not only thirst, but habits. If you find you frequently go all day without a drink, or if your urine is dark yellow, that can be an indication you're not drinking enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is one of the simplest and most neglected ways to help both your mental and physical well-being. It's not the holy grail, but it is a healthy daily habit that can pay real dividends in the long run. We all have to start from somewhere, so why not the simplest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5gFBVV95cUxNZ1hrNTlEU2lVd3ZtWU5LNXlaZDVXSG1abHl5bjMyMGY0Q0JoVmRMcURhczg0SzB5b1VJMzhxVlJBdXAzeXloU3ZKM2RrY2o5Nl9ZQ3R2NkVZUGhZSVlaSWZTME9zRl93RXBIRy1CZG5US2hxWUpZMzhCWlJ0alhuSGZRVmlNVk5QazdjUktVd0pDQWFjeXNQakhmOE9QRzU0U2RLLW05MUExN0s0QWhyOU1rblF4eEpsc0FWRHNNb0poUWsxcVNEam4zZ3czSEVGWjF1SS1pN2xsMkd6aGQ5QjZfVUpvUQ</guid></item><item><title>多达10万名加利福尼亚人可能患有以前在美国罕见的潜在致命“接吻虫”疾病-雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://ca.news.yahoo.com/100-000-californians-could-potentially-141242198.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Up to 100,000 &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/california" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Californians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Californians&lt;/a&gt; have been infected with a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/heart-disease-diet-salt-potassium-risk-b2817255.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potentially fatal disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;potentially fatal disease&lt;/a&gt; — without even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas disease, caused by a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/parasites" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:parasite;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;parasite&lt;/a&gt; that lives inside so-called “kissing bugs,” has been reported in California and 29 other U.S. states, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-01/chagas-disease-the-deadly-disease-youve-never-heard-of-but-is-here" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Los Angeles Times.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The illness, which has potentially infected between 70,000 and 100,000 California residents, lies dormant for years, only making itself known when victims suffer serious cardiac issues, including heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are roughly a dozen species of the blood-sucking kissing bugs in the U.S., and four are found in California. Some &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/los-angeles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Los Angeles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Los Angeles &lt;/a&gt;hotspots, including Griffith Park, are teeming with bugs infected with the Chagas disease parasite. A third of all kissing bugs at the famous park and observatory carry the parasite, and the disease has been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” Norman Beatty, an epidemiologist and Chagas disease expert, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. “But it’s also here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 100,000 Californians have been infected with Chagas disease, caused by kissing bugs, according to a report. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Due to its prevalence in the U.S., researchers are now calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify the disease as endemic, which means it is consistently present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;California has more residents who have been infected with Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, than any other state, in part due to there being so many residents who come from countries where the disease is endemic, according to the report. A study by California’s Department of Health found that 31 of 40 human cases reported between 2013 and 2023 were acquired in other countries. Officials could not rule out local transmission for the remaining cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the disease was once only found in more rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, it is now present in at least 30 U.S. states. About 8 million people globally and an estimated 280,000 in the U.S. have Chagas disease without even knowing it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors and physicians are not required to report cases of the disease in California, as they would have to for other diseases such as influenza, Lyme and malaria, meaning cases are likely vastly underreported. Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg,” and that no one truly knows the true total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance,” Hamer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Hamer, many people only discover they have Chagas after trying to donate blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas can cause acute reactions, including swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, though its longer-term effects, such as seizures or strokes, are much more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other symptoms include fever, feeling tired, body aches, headaches, rash, a loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting and eyelid swelling. These symptoms may be mild but would appear in the first weeks or months after infection, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disease, while curable if antiparasitic treatment is provided early on, can often lead to sometimes fatal cardiac issues, including heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 14:12:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPaVNzbkdOTDhqOEZjM25ETks4eEpVXzhncjcxU2tKU2M2Sl9CMWt3eGM0SW5CVjRFQ0kwb1VaaUR5OTAzQmNocFM3UkVjamNpWmVMWG1tVS1TZjZ6YUlFX1EwaWNmdm1rckRPS3pIMGZUeHB5aUxYMXR5UzlfOThiV1dkMnhOUQ</guid></item><item><title>我以为我的眼睛疼痛是因为屏幕时间过长……这是一种令人痛苦的疾病的第一个迹象--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-15054967/woman-eye-pain-multiple-sclerosis-symptom-sign.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who thought her eye pain was from too much screen time has revealed how she discovered that it was actually the first sign that she was battling a harrowing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amanda Hahn, 29, from New York, said there were little clues for years that something was wrong with her - including memory problems and random bouts of numbness - but she 'brushed them off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first big symptom that 'made her pause' was a 'sharp pain in her eye' whenever she 'looked down and to the side.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it didn't occur to her that it was something serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first, I blamed it on my job. I work in digital marketing at an agency, so I'm glued to a computer screen all day,' she explained during an exclusive chat with the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I am not glued to my computer screen, I am on my phone. It felt natural to assume it was just eye strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've always been the type to brush off little health things like, "Oh, it's nothing." So the idea that it could be something serious didn't even cross my mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when her vision 'started to change' in 2019, she finally decided it was time to go to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman who thought her eye pain was from too much screen time has revealed how she discovered that it was actually the first sign that she was battling a harrowing disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda Hahn, 29, from New York, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things looked blurry, colors seemed off, and my eye just didn't feel right,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew it wasn't just screen fatigue anymore. That's when I went to the eye doctor - and everything escalated quickly from there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After examining her, the eye doctor suggested she go to the ER for an MRI, and she soon learned that she was battling multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was completely in shock. My parents were out of the country at the time, and I had spent the entire day in the ER waiting for my MRI and the results,' she recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a nurse finally came in, she just handed me a pamphlet and said, "This is what your life will look like in 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Honestly, I didn't even believe her at first. My mom also has MS, so I was confused... how could this really be happening to me too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I ended up going to several other doctors just to confirm the diagnosis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said there were little clues for years that something was wrong with her - including memory problems and random bouts of numbness - but she 'brushed them off'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The first big symptom that 'made her pause' was a 'sharp pain in her eye' whenever she 'looked down and to the side'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said, 'When I am not glued to my computer screen, I am on my phone.

That mindset helps me stay grounded and positive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she admitted that she was 'not very healthy' before her diagnosis - 'late nights, bad food choices, and not much activity' during college - she said the diagnosis 'completely changed how she approaches her health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flash forward to now, six years later, and Amanda has learned to live with the disease &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'[Every day] I remind myself that MS is part of my life, but it doesn't define my life,' she explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She often documents her journey with MS on social media, where she said she's received a slew of positive messages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I try to walk every day, eat fewer processed foods, and stick to a low-carb lifestyle.

They found remnants of the human pegavirus (HPgV) in half of all brains with Parkinson's and none in those without the degenerative disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with the virus had distinct immune responses and advanced brain changes, which were further impacted by genetic mutations. Parkinson's gets worse over time, gradually degrading the part of the brain that produces dopamine, a chemical critical for controlling movement, which causes tremors, stiffness, and falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with Parkinson's who had the virus in their brains showed more advanced brain damage. Those who had the virus in their blood also showed signs that their cells were struggling to produce energy and clean out damaged parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPgV is spread through blood and is a close relative of the Hepatitis C virus. However, unlike Hepatitis C, HPgV was not previously believed to cause any illness and was thought to lie dormant in the body. This latest study challenges that assumption, suggesting it may play a role in Parkinson's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, said in a statement: ‘For a virus that was thought to be harmless, these findings suggest it may have important effects, in the context of Parkinson’s disease. It may influence how Parkinson’s develops, especially in people with certain genetic backgrounds.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause of Parkinson’s, which affects about one million Americans and also causes trouble walking and cognitive problems, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14800655/The-huge-Parkinsons-risk-linked-you-LIVE-worse-upmarket-areas-Experts-reveal-risk.html"&gt;is still unknown&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have been researching &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856205/Doctors-environmental-cause-Parkinsons-young.html"&gt;possible contributors&lt;/a&gt; for years, and viruses are among several possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the brain detects a virus, it triggers inflammation as a defense mechanism. While this is meant to fight the infection, chronic or overzealous inflammation can accidentally damage or kill delicate brain cells, including the dopamine-producing neurons whose death is characteristic of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michael J Fox, pictured in April 2025, is one of the most high-profile Parkinson's sufferers. He founded The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which has been responsible for landmark research into the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the blood analysis, researchers turned to a library of samples from over 1,000 participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), a major study launched by The Michael J. Fox Foundation to accelerate research and treatment discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists analyzed the brain tissue of 24 deceased individuals. Ten of them had Parkinson's when they died, and 14 did not. They detected the virus in half of the Parkinson's brains and in none of the brains from the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPgV is a common, symptomless infection previously not known to infect the brain. As of 2024, studies estimate that about four percent of Americans have an active HPgV infection, and up to 12 percent have been exposed to the virus at some point in their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary route of transmission is through exposure to infected blood, such as from shared needles or, historically, through blood transfusions before widespread screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with a specific Parkinson’s-related gene mutation, LRRK2, the body’s immune system reacted more aggressively to the virus compared to Parkinson’s patients without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene mutation rewired the brain's immune circuitry when the virus was present in the blood, leading to a dysfunctional and harmful inflammatory response that would not have happened if the person had either the virus or the gene mutation alone, but not both together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ensuing inflammation in the brain led to brain damage that contributed to Parkinson's. It damages and kills neurons, particularly the dopamine-producing cells in the brain region known as the substantia nigra, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We were surprised to find it in the brains of Parkinson’s patients at such high frequency and not in the controls,’ Dr Koralnik said. ‘Even more unexpected was how the immune system responded differently, depending on a person’s genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The little-known group of conditions can lead to Parkinson's disease, the fresh study revealed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This suggests it could be an environmental factor that interacts with the body in ways we didn’t realize before.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also detected the virus in the spinal fluid of Parkinson's patients, but not in those without the neurological disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Parkinson’s disease, the area of the brain that produces dopamine begins to deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to playing a crucial role in the brain’s reward system, dopamine is key to the brain's movement control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without sufficient dopamine, the brain's movement circuit becomes impaired, leading to stiffness and tremors, as well as difficulty initiating movement, such as getting up from a chair, and slowness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with the virus in their brain tissue also had a greater build-up of toxic tau protein and abnormal levels of key brain proteins, indicating very advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau is a protein that typically helps stabilize microtubules, the internal scaffolding of brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it becomes damaged and misfolded, it is a general sign that the brain cell is failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dopamine levels in the brain from normal levels to Parkinson’s affected levels (left to right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding more tau pathology in these patients is a strong indicator that the virus is associated with more widespread brain cell damage and dysfunction, not just the specific dopamine cell loss typical of pure Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://devel-insight.jci.org/articles/view/189988"&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment options for Parkinson’s are limited in what they accomplish. They mainly provide symptomatic relief by managing motor symptoms, but they cannot cure or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levodopa (L-Dopa) is the gold standard and most effective treatment. The brain converts L-Dopa into dopamine, which directly replaces the missing chemical that is causing the core movement symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 10 million people worldwide, including about 1million Americans, are estimated to have Parkinson’s disease, and that number is to grow to more than 25 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Koralnik said: ‘We plan to look more closely at how genes like LRRK2 affect the body’s response to other viral infections to figure out if this is a special effect of HPgV or a broader response to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One big question we still need to answer is how often the virus gets into the brains of people with or without Parkinson’s. We also aim to understand how viruses and genes interact; insights that could reveal how Parkinson’s begins and could help guide future therapies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
