Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren’t considered “added sugars” under FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Now our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what’s in a typical can of soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But that might be too flexible, Popp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The key is to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/food-safety"&gt;be mindful of what you’re eating&lt;/a&gt;, even if the product &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/28e626562c88439b96056e843215aa8d"&gt;seems healthy&lt;/a&gt; or if the package is labeled organic, Popp said. Roasted nuts, plant-based milks and wasabi peas, for example, can include a surprising amount of added sugars.

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;The patient was rushed to the Cam Khe Regional Medical Center suffering from dizziness, persistent vomiting, and acute pain in the right upper abdomen, doctors said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to her family, she initially took three tablets, but when the pain persisted, she consumed five more, nearly exhausting an entire blister pack. It is not clear while the family failed to monitor her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with a severe overdose and provided intensive treatment involving antidotes and intravenous fluids, allowing her condition to stabilize after five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;While paracetamol is a common over-the-counter pain reliever, medical experts warn of a rising trend in poisoning cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Nguyen Duy Long from the center's Toxicology Department noted that while the drug is generally safe, overdoses or even therapeutic doses can be toxic for individuals who are malnourished, alcohol-dependent, or suffering from liver disease. Prolonged use or combining multiple medications containing paracetamol can lead to severe complications, including acute liver injury, liver failure, coagulation disorders, and multi-organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Medical recommendations state that the maximum daily dose for adults should not exceed 3.5 to 4 grams within 24 hours, with doses spaced four to six hours apart. For the standard 500 mg tablet, this equates to a maximum of six tablets per day. In children, the dosage must be strictly calculated based on body weight, typically 10–15 mg per kilogram per dose, with a daily maximum of 50–70 mg per kilogram. Parents are advised to use powder sachets or rectal suppositories when necessary, ensuring each dose is spaced at least five to six hours apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Doctor Long advises against self-medicating with excessive doses or using painkillers for prolonged periods without professional guidance. Medications should always be taken according to the specific instructions of pharmacists or healthcare workers, with a particular warning against combining different drugs that contain the same active ingredient, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Parents are urged to supervise medication use for children, store medicines safely to avoid confusion, and seek immediate medical attention if any abnormal symptoms occur after ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4856728,4908227,4695117,3639716,3502109" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, feel free to mix and match meals if there's one you don’t like. Because we created this meal plan with healthy blood sugar in mind, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutritional profile, particularly as it pertains to calories, carbohydrates, fiber and protein. You can feel free to repeat a meal in this list or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17899/health-condition/diabetic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diabetes-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if you prefer. Each breakfast ranges from 301 to 453 calories and 35 to 48 grams of carbs. Lunch options span 374 to 416 calories and 43 to 46 grams of carbohydrates. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;How many carbs should I eat per day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation for how many carbs you should eat per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Factors like body size and activity level can impact how your blood sugar responds to carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Paying attention to how your blood sugar reacts to the foods you eat can help clue you in to the best routine for your body. For more individualized recommendations, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_181-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Overlook Your Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;: People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart disease compared to people without.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When eating for better blood sugars, consider the impact on your heart health as well. Strategies like increasing fiber and keeping an eye on saturated fat and sodium can help protect your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair Protein With Carbs&lt;/strong&gt;: To prevent blood sugar spikes and promote more stable levels, aim to pair carbohydrates with protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that this strategy results in lower blood sugar levels compared to a carbohydrate consumed without a protein source.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To do this in practice, pair a carbohydrate food, like fruit, with a protein source such as nuts, edamame, peanut butter, cottage cheese, yogurt or a hard-boiled egg.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;: Because total added sugar intake can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, it may be helpful to take inventory of where added sugars may be making their way in your routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While we opted to skip added sugar entirely in this plan, that’s not necessary or sustainable for most people long-term. Instead, aim to follow the American Heart Association's recommendation of limiting added sugar to 9 teaspoons (36 grams) for men and 6 teaspoons (25 grams) for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to dessert items, things like sweetened drinks, flavored yogurt, cereals, granola bars, granola and many prepared foods are common sources of added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump Up the Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate that can help promote better blood sugar and improve heart health - a win-win!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber-rich foods travel through the digestive system slower than refined grains and added sugar, which means it can help you feel fuller for longer and promote a steadier release of glucose, resulting in more stable blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber-rich foods include whole-grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include Physical Activity&lt;/strong&gt;: The American Diabetes Association recommends people aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While that’s a great goal to aim for, don’t fret if you’re not there yet. Research shows that walking for just two to five minutes after a meal can help reduce blood sugar levels, further proving that small daily habits can lead to big impacts on health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The company clarified that the issue pertained to a single batch identified in January 2025 and did not merit a blanket warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company strongly refuted the “over-cautionary and misplaced reference” to 2023 made in the recent Australian advisory, stressing that it “does not reflect the current situation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhayrab has been manufactured by IIL since 2000, with over 210 million doses supplied across India and 40 countries. It continues to hold a 40 per cent market share in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) advised that Australian travellers who received the anti-rabies vaccine Abhayrab in India after November 1, 2023, should consider the vaccination invalid and start a new course. In January 2025, IIL proactively identified a packaging anomaly in one specific batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company official said, “The company immediately notified Indian regulators and law enforcement agencies, lodged a formal complaint and worked closely with authorities to ensure swift action. Importantly, this was an isolated incident and the counterfeit batch is no longer available on shelves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inbtw_content_maindiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IIL emphasised that every batch of vaccine manufactured in India was tested and released by the Central Drugs Laboratory before being made available for sale or administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunil Tiwari, vice-president &amp;amp; head of quality management, IIL, said the company aimed to reassure stakeholders that its pharmacovigilance and quality systems were robust and the public could continue to trust vaccines supplied directly by IIL and its authorised channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Tribune India</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 20:30:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUDhEZVdxeFJVMk01c0lFZnNuM0YxUF9KUVhQX0hlOTJrR2I0OVdPMnI3NUdmcXhqLUZ5UldWUW5FVllvd3dOd3F5LW43MFZVRFE0TkFNSG9SYUNZdlJ6VjQxZlpGYkxWUFhXSHdVQ0k5T0FDVF8zdVdYdGE3UklBZDFGcjY0bjJnRFd6bEJpZDhZZE4zTHJDZWZOWThUdHluQVUybE10VjNBNlXSAa8BQVVfeXFMTnFIaDRYRFExU21HUHNKeS1Bb2IxUmVQaHpqM3hDTUtkQ1gxclBBUmlzVlVaOE9Gek5uTTZybnJNaDdtUDR1dWJiQUk4a0xWTjAzd1NLNXY2YUIwRWg1dnRSZTBBVjhvUnRHUjFLYVk2aHJVRXNubDF5X3MzSkhadjM0VC1QcWQzT2tITk9sRzloMktkZlVrZUppUDNVeFIta3Q2UFM3OEdxTG9idlVTRQ</guid></item><item><title>一位胃肠病学家说，这种受欢迎的食物正在严重破坏您的肠道- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/gastroenterologist-says-popular-food-wreaking-183000546.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Avoid This Popular Food for Better Gut Health&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;d3sign - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69771726/symptoms-of-unhealthy-gut/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy gut;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt; and digestive tract has much wider implications for your health than just avoiding GI woes.

Dr. Dibba explains that processed foods, especially those that are acidic, may damage the gut lining—the barrier that absorbs water and nutrients while preventing toxins and partially digested food from making it to the bloodstream.

Researchers showed that a severe drop in NAD+—a core energy molecule—drives Alzheimer’s pathology in both human brains and mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring proper NAD+ balance with the drug P7C3-A20 not only prevented disease in at-risk mice but also reversed advanced pathology, repairing brain damage and fully restoring cognitive function. The findings point to a major shift in how Alzheimer’s may be treated, suggesting that recovery—not just slowing decline—could one day be achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central NAD+ Failure:&lt;/strong&gt; Human and mouse Alzheimer’s brains showed a dramatic loss of NAD+, impairing essential cellular functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversal Achieved:&lt;/strong&gt; Restoring NAD+ balance repaired pathology and fully recovered cognition even in mice with advanced disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Treatment Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; The targeted drug P7C3-A20 restored healthy NAD+ levels without the dangers linked to over-the-counter NAD+ boosters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University Hospital Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For over a century, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114448"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/alzheimers-reversed-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finding that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on their previous work, published in &lt;em&gt;Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA,&lt;/em&gt; showing that restoring the brain’s NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, not only did preserving NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer’s disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to dangerously high levels that promote cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to supraphysiologic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer’s reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766864151217"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about NAD+ in Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They found that a severe decline in NAD+ is a major driver of Alzheimer’s pathology, disrupting energy balance and damaging key brain systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766864152647"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can restoring NAD+ actually reverse advanced Alzheimer’s effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Here, however, we provide proof of principle for therapeutic reversibility of advanced AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advanced disease amyloid-driven 5xFAD mice, treatment with P7C3-A20, which restores nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis, reverses tau phosphorylation, blood-brain barrier deterioration, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and neuroinflammation and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, resulting in full cognitive recovery and reduction of plasma levels of the clinical AD biomarker p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P7C3-A20 also reverses advanced disease in tau-driven PS19 mice and protects human brain microvascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress. In humans and mice, pathology severity correlates with disruption of brain NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and the brains of nondemented people with Alzheimer’s neuropathology exhibit gene expression patterns suggestive of preserved NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-six proteins aberrantly expressed in advanced 5xFAD mouse brain and normalized by P7C3-A20 show similar alterations in human AD brain, revealing targets with potential for optimizing translation to patient care.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 19:41:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBXeHI4RXRfalQ5MVEyZmlucDdQV1dZWGlBTTAwd3JBZGVvU1ZrY3NxUEJORVR2LXlVS0dYRDdKeUJzbWE0czJ6Q2xXVXV1OEdjS3pVN05hMEswMk1HTHBNUUFDOThYaU1neUJ4dE96dnY2V0xUMFNKckpDVU8xUQ</guid></item><item><title>女人的妈妈不可信，最终假装心脏病发作，所以她的女儿拒绝拨打911 ，让她忍受后果- TwistedSifter</title><link>https://twistedsifter.com/2025/12/womans-mom-fakes-a-heart-attack-so-her-daughter-refuses-to-call-911-and-leaves/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pek061/aita_for_not_calling_an_ambulance_for_my_mother/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In this story&lt;/a&gt;, one woman is in this exact situation with her mother, and she refused to call 911. Now, she wondering if that was the wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s read the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for not calling an ambulance for my mother?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My (20f) mother (55f) is a narcissist. It’s become worse as I’ve gotten older, but basically, she has to make everything about herself always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s always twisting someone else’s problems to make it about her or lying about the dumbest stuff to gain attention or screaming and fake crying when someone says she’s in the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s a complete attention seeker, and I’m convinced she has a personally disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her mother is convinced she has other medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, she’s taken to faking medical issues or illness to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s done this before like faking a gluten allergy despite still eating gluten with no problems, or pretending to have the most obviously fake panic attack when being called out for her nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems, that isn’t enough, and for the past few weeks, she’s been talking about being diagnosed with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an argument at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we had dinner and my brother (25m) told us that he wanted to marry his girlfriend (just said it casually, not like he actually proposed yet or anything).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom doesn’t like brother’s girlfriend ever since they started dating (even though she’s only meet her a handful of times), and decided to get into a screaming-match about it with my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t having any of it, and just got up and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with him because, jokes on me if I’m going to stay with her when she’s like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mother’s next move was pretty extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, she then ‘fainted’, making pain-noises, while writhing on the ground. I think she was trying to imitate a seizure while conscious? IDK but she looked like a fish flopping around crazily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I just stared at her, as it honestly looked like an adult throwing a tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told us she was having a heart attack and to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When neither of us did, she screamed that we were selfish children letting her die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was definitely faking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t end up leaving then, but we did stay to see what she’d do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After neither of us really reacted for a few minutes, she got up, totally fine, but was mad at us for not helping her and started screaming again about how we’re abusing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then brother and I left for real, and went to his girlfriend’s house. That’s where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, she’s wondering if she should’ve called 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently she posted on Facebook about how she survived her heart attack, while berating my brother and me for not caring about her and being emotionally abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aunt (not actually my aunt but mom’s best friend), messaged me and my brother about it and I told her what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said I should have just called 911 anyway because it wasn’t my place to say and they could have determined if she was really fine or not, but I’m so sick of her lying nonsense and I’m not wasting 911’s time on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So AITA because I didn’t call them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling 911 would’ve been a waste of time for 911. She did the right thing. Her mom needs therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how Reddit reacted to this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person would’ve called 911.&lt;/p&gt;

But epigenetic factors such as our behaviors, environments and diets can turn some genes on or shut others off through different processes. One such mechanism is DNA methylation, the focus of the new study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What we were looking for here are the chemical ‘tags’ that can be added onto your DNA,” said Jordana Bell, a professor in epigenomics at King’s College London and the lead author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Consider it the “grammar” of your genome, said José M. Ordovás, a senior scientist and leader of the Precision Nutrition &amp;amp; Healthy Aging directive at Tufts University who was not involved in the study. These markers don’t alter the fixed sequence of your DNA, but the tags (like punctuation marks) affect how they are expressed,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;DNA methylation patterns also shift with age, allowing for the development of epigenetic clocks that estimate biological (rather than chronological) age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Using these clocks to compare epigenetic markers of aging among the study participants, the researchers found a link between higher levels of theobromine in the blood and reduced signs of cellular aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;After running further tests to see whether other cocoa components - including caffeine - showed similar patterns, Bell and her team discovered it occurred only with theobromine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What our results are suggesting is that [theobromine] might be affecting the activity of genes,” Bell said. “And then that contributes to aging and health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s also possible that something synergistic is going on with the theobromine and other chocolate components they &lt;i&gt;didn’t &lt;/i&gt;measure in the study, such as polyphenols, Bell said. These anti-inflammatory compounds, which are also found in dark chocolate, are linked to better brain function, a more varied gut microbiome, and lower risks of conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_are_the_study_limitations" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

One of the sample groups did complete a food questionnaire that asked how frequently the participants ate chocolate, but it didn’t delve into specifics such as what kind they were eating, the percentage of cocoa it had, or how much of it they ate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The data also comes from one single point in time, so the study wasn’t able to see how theobromine levels over weeks, months or years might relate to aging rates, Bell said. “You need to see things moving one time after another,” Ordovás said. “That brings more confidence.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And epigenetic clocks aren’t set in stone. “These are dynamic estimates,” Bell said. “It just means that at this point in time, looking at your DNA, we estimate that you seem to be aging a little bit slower or faster than we would expect based on your chronological age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This is a good thing because you can use this knowledge to guide diet or other health interventions to change your biological age estimate, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_does_this_mean_for_choosing_chocolate" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile 
             padding_top_24"&gt;What does this mean for choosing chocolate?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The findings about theobromine add to what we know about the other health-promoting compounds in dark chocolate, such as polyphenols. And here are some recommendations about dark chocolate from Alexis Supan, an outpatient dietitian at the Bariatric &amp;amp; Metabolic Institute with the Cleveland Clinic:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While anything above 50 percent cocoa solids can be considered “dark” chocolate, that range is a big one, and you’d probably be better served aiming for 70 percent or greater.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The higher the percentage, the more bitter it will be, but it will also bring a higher concentration of the beneficial compounds and less of the “not-so-healthy things like the saturated fat and the sugar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure that cocoa is the first ingredient listed on the label. Ideally, you’d want just three ingredients: cocoa, sugar and cocoa butter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Choose chocolate that isn’t Dutch-processed, which is sometimes listed on the label. This alkalization process mellows its flavor, but also strips away some of the polyphenols. “You’re not getting quite as much antioxidant power,” Supan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For balance in your diet, keep the rest of your daily added sugar in check. A one-ounce serving of dark chocolate can provide about one-third of the daily upper limit for women and one-quarter for men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dark chocolate can contain higher levels of harmful metals such as cadmium and lead, which are riskier for pregnant people or younger children, Supan said. Consumer Reports has a list of levels in many popular brands, so you can make an informed decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As long as the chocolate fits this criteria, what form you choose to consume it in, whether in a mug or bar, shouldn’t matter. But when used in baking - say, that dark chocolate cake or rich, gooey cookies - keep in mind that the cocoa is competing with ingredients such as butter, sugar and flour, so you’re probably taking in less of the good products, Supan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Her tip for the holidays? Try a dark chocolate bark. You can make it festive with some fruit and nuts, but you’ll still be getting a solid dose of the actual dark chocolate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finally, if you aren’t a fan of chocolate, don’t force yourself to eat it simply for some type of cellular benefits that theobromine might bring. After all, “methylation is involved in aging, but it is a tiny percentage compared with all the many other factors,” Ordovás said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These include your diet as a whole, physical activity, sleep and stress levels. “This is one tiny little sliver, and it’s a great reason to not feel bad about having an ounce of dark chocolate today,” Supan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQdXNQR19uMmJzOXc4QWh5MzNucXk2UkxyS0IyNUxDWElsRmhDYmQxZGhnWEM5VDRSUTl2RGJHN28wSXYwZnJfa1lPSFNiWnNVR3VmT3Rib1EtNG1OUjJkTmZ6UTF3VkFCaFh1ZUpUZWw0ZWJLZEphQlVvNzNxWkdyWlVOMkNZcGxIdEE</guid></item><item><title>与大学生多动症症状增加相关的童年不良经历- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/adverse-childhood-experiences-linked-to-increased-adhd-symptoms-in-college-students/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251370427" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides new evidence that difficult childhood experiences may contribute to symptoms of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in young adults. The findings suggest that these adverse events disrupt an individual’s ability to regulate emotions and practice self-compassion, which in turn exacerbates attention and hyperactivity issues. This research highlights the potential for psychological interventions focusing on self-kindness to help mitigate ADHD symptoms stemming from early life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Individuals with the inattentive presentation often struggle to sustain focus, stay organized, and remember daily tasks. Those with the hyperactive-impulsive presentation may experience inner restlessness, excessive physical movement, and difficulty waiting their turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ADHD is often viewed as a biological or genetic condition, environmental factors also play a significant role in its development and severity. Previous scientific literature has established that adverse childhood experiences, often referred to as ACEs, are linked to a variety of negative mental health outcomes. ACEs include events such as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as household dysfunctions like domestic violence, parental divorce, or family incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the known link between early trauma and general psychological distress, fewer studies have specifically examined how these events influence ADHD symptoms in college students. There is also a lack of research regarding the internal protective factors that might buffer these effects. The authors of the current study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the psychological mechanisms connecting early adversity to adult ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers specifically sought to understand the role of emotion regulation and self-compassion. Emotion regulation refers to the processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have and how they experience and express them. Self-compassion involves treating oneself with warmth and understanding during difficult times rather than reacting with harsh self-judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in Türkiye, a cultural context where traditional child-rearing practices and family structures may influence how adverse experiences are processed. The research team recruited a sample of 442 young adults from a public university. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 29 years, with an average age of approximately 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample was predominantly female, making up 67.4% of the group, while males accounted for 32.6%. The researchers collected data using a web-based survey tool. Participants were informed of their rights and provided consent before completing a battery of validated psychological measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess early life difficulties, the researchers used the Adverse Childhood Experiences Checklist. This 10-item measure asks participants to indicate whether they experienced specific types of abuse or household dysfunction before the age of 18. Responses were recorded using a simple yes or no format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current ADHD symptoms were measured using the Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1). This 18-item questionnaire screens for symptoms experienced over the past six months. It includes two subscales: one for inattention and one for hyperactivity-impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed emotion regulation using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short Form. This scale measures how frequently individuals use strategies like cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression to manage their emotions. For this study, the authors focused on the general ability to manage emotional experiences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion was measured using the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. This 12-item instrument assesses how kind and caring individuals are toward themselves during instances of pain or failure. It includes elements such as self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that adverse childhood experiences were common among the participants. Approximately 76% of the students reported experiencing at least one adverse event. About 27% of the sample reported four or more adverse experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis revealed clear associations between the variables. Students who reported a higher number of adverse childhood experiences tended to have lower levels of self-compassion. These students also exhibited lower levels of emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, higher scores on the ACEs checklist were associated with higher levels of both attention deficit and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms. The researchers used a technique called path analysis to test how these variables influenced one another. This analysis suggested that the relationship between early adversity and ADHD symptoms was not entirely direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data supported a model where adverse childhood experiences lead to lower self-compassion. This lack of self-compassion then predicts difficulties in emotion regulation. Finally, poor emotion regulation predicts increased severity of ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion appeared to play a mediating role. The analysis showed that self-compassion had an indirect effect on the relationship between ACEs and emotion regulation. It also had an indirect effect on the association between ACEs and ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that emotion regulation mediated the link between self-compassion and ADHD symptoms. This implies that one reason self-compassion helps reduce ADHD symptoms is that it improves an individual’s ability to manage their emotions. All variables together accounted for 22% of the variance in attention deficit symptoms and 16% of the variance in hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that individuals with high levels of self-compassion are better equipped to process adverse experiences constructively. They are less likely to engage in self-criticism or shame. This positive self-regard appears to foster better emotional control, which subsequently reduces the intensity of ADHD-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted that adaptive emotion regulation strategies serve as protective factors. When individuals can reappraise stressful situations rather than suppressing their feelings, they may experience less impulsivity and better focus. The disruption of these skills by early trauma appears to be a key pathway to ADHD symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to this study that should be considered. The research relied on self-reported data, which can be subject to memory errors or social desirability bias. Participants may not have remembered childhood events accurately or may have been hesitant to report them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study utilized a cross-sectional design, meaning data was collected at a single point in time. This prevents the researchers from establishing definitive cause-and-effect relationships. It is possible that the relationships between these variables work in different directions than hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample consisted solely of university students in Türkiye. This specific demographic means the results may not generalize to other populations, such as older adults, those not in college, or people from different cultural backgrounds. Additionally, the participants were screened for symptoms but were not clinically diagnosed with ADHD by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlighted the potential overlap between ADHD and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Individuals with PTSD often display hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts that can mimic the inattention seen in ADHD. It is important for clinicians to distinguish between trauma-related inattention and neurodevelopmental attention deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should employ longitudinal designs to track these variables over time. This would help clarify how early adversity impacts the development of these symptoms throughout young adulthood. Including clinical samples with formal ADHD diagnoses would also strengthen the validity of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers significant implications for mental health support. The results suggest that interventions aimed at increasing self-compassion could be beneficial for college students with ADHD symptoms, particularly those with a history of trauma. Teaching students to be kind to themselves may improve their emotional regulation and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251370427" target="_blank"&gt;Adverse Childhood Experiences and ADHD in College Students: Exploring the Role of Emotion Regulation and Self-Compassion&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Fikriye Eda Karaçul and Gökmen Arslan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:07:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQVXl0eHpUSDdOZ0M1MWlxNG9QLW1mT0FvQlVYajQtTGd1RDZkRnJwZHVJeEdDSU92Z1Ayci0wVTV5cVE4Q3VWWmpVUURteDFQSnJPdXAyRk1vNDVIWFdTTkpCTTZuODdwR3VJY19wTDQyOGEyblBYU0l4WWQyeVRUZExrenlwZHA4U0JMUkczQjNtdE0ybzgxQ19FNUxFYnJ0S3ZMd3llVklIY01a</guid></item><item><title>狗在多大程度上减轻了我们的压力？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/how-much-do-dogs-reduce-our-stress-1/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-hEgojh wpds-c-hEgojh-ikjuZWZ-css PodcastCarousel_storyCard__hJIce"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" alt="Broken Doors " src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcast.posttv.com%2Fseries%2F20220324%2Ft_1648139452139_name_RelatedImage_900x300.jpg&amp;amp;w=400"&gt;&lt;p class="PodcastCarousel_storyDesc__ZCeG0"&gt;An investigation into no-knock warrants in the American justice system — and what happens when accountability is flawed at every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:02:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxONnRWQjlnN0trWGFaMGJnT1NieGpVdGN6SjEyTm1rWVBWenFKZFNyN3U0UkViNE9hTUg0bk1PX1lRNTBaZEROOEdHMXNRU3hGYUZtbEp0RkMzV2VpYTZ0UmZBVXRfRGJvSmphck1RWFJQcDdSMFB2dmw3YjIwN21aYXV3MHdlZVVRcEdXSGxDV0F6TEcw</guid></item><item><title>我每天早上喝柠檬水，并注意到身体的这3个好处-健康：值得信赖和富有同情心的健康信息</title><link>https://www.health.com/daily-lemon-water-benefits-11831207</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking lemon water is the first thing I do every single morning. I have done it for as long as I can remember. Why? It keeps me hydrated, supports digestion, and boosts my immune system—and it might even make my skin glow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love water, but lemon makes it more fun. Starting every morning with lemon water helps hydrate me after sleep and sets me up for my morning workout. It also knocks several cups of water off my daily hydration goal of at least ten.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I always appreciate simple digestive aids that don't require supplements. Lemons are one answer. For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;One very small study found that the acid in lemons increases gastric emptying (how quickly the stomach digests food).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another study found that taking vitamin C supplements improves "good" gut bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, which also helps fight infection.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-it-supports-heart-health-and-healing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Citrus fruits like lemons are high in vitamin C and other antioxidants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phenolic compounds are antioxidants that support healthy blood pressure, blood flow, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/lower-cholesterol-naturally-8350243" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; ("healthy cholesterol") levels. All of this reduces your risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C helps with tissue repair and growth. It's an important part of collagen, a key protein in skin, joints, and bones that loses strength with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what exactly do I do? (Hint: It's very simple.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm up water:&lt;/strong&gt; I fill a 24-ounce mason jar with water and microwave it for about 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add lemon:&lt;/strong&gt; I add half a lemon per 24 ounces of water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink slowly:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first thing I consume every day, before tea/coffee or breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I continue this trend when traveling as much as possible—because how hard is it to bring or buy a lemon? It's especially helpful after later-than-usual bedtimes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning lemon water is simply what I do now: it is a fully-formed habit. It reminds me that health doesn't need to be overcomplicated, time-consuming, or expensive. It also reminds me that the smallest habit can make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lemon water has a few caveats due to its acidic nature.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;My top tip: Wait about an hour before brushing your teeth.&lt;/strong&gt; This allows your saliva to wash away the acid and protects tooth enamel.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Dental Association (ADA) also recommends rinsing your mouth with water or eating dairy after highly acidic meals or beverages and using a straw for acidic beverages, which I will start doing.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Side note: I often do oil-pulling, otherwise known as swishing coconut oil in my mouth for several minutes and spitting it out. Many people believe it has benefits, but the ADA points out the lack of research.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, my dental hygienist recently commented on the whiteness of my teeth and told me I have basically no plaque.

The new weekly toll marks a 38% week-over-week surge in laboratory-confirmed flu infections. It's a milestone in an already rough flu season that &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/flu-season-arrives-in-ny-with-major-spike-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrived early&lt;/a&gt; and drove down &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-school-attendance-drops-parents-freak-out-as-flu-season-foils-christmas-plans" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attendance at the city’s public schools&lt;/a&gt; during the week leading into the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1gcvh"&gt;Hospitalizations tied to influenza jumped sharply, with 3,666 New Yorkers requiring inpatient care compared to 2,251 the week before, continuing a trend of rising severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fhqm6"&gt;“We can look at how hospitals are doing around New York every two hours, so we can monitor whether hospitals are being overwhelmed or not,” McDonald said. “Right now things are going smoothly, but this is something we're paying close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="khon"&gt;Health officials declared influenza “prevalent” across New York state earlier this month, requiring health care facilities to have unvaccinated personnel wear masks around patients and residents. The designation reflects widespread transmission across all regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9lh0v"&gt;McDonald said it was too early to say when the season would reach its peak, but warned “it is gonna get worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="djg7s"&gt;State health officials say it's not too late to get a flu vaccine. This year’s vaccination rate is roughly in line with past years. But this year's flu strain is more severe, McDonald said, so “if you haven't had your flu vaccine this year, this is the year to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ee2bu"&gt;Those who are sick — especially children, people who are older or people who have underlying health conditions — should reach out to their doctors for antiviral drugs that can reduce symptoms and complications. However, the drugs must be started within 48 hours of coming down with the flu to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7cft6"&gt;People who are feeling ill “should really not go to work or not visit family,” McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f2epd"&gt;He also suggested those who are immunocompromised or have a serious underlying disease wear an N95 or KN95 mask in crowded indoor spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bpmrs"&gt;COVID-19 and RSV — another respiratory illness — also continue to circulate, but state data shows COVID-19 hospitalizations have been relatively stable in recent weeks and RSV activity has seen smaller increases compared with influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPa1I2U1VoLVROOEJOVDBlN2ExbGlYTFlwb1pfMHpXRFg3MHhoVUJ3ZFBhMGJpZ3BON1RENWZIWDdWZ0gtT1A2QkhmTGVUaXNueHZ6VTZlclRGRkFrUklmcWxCQXRTWlZLZVRNb3FOUDZEQmtScFNyUWdZWm5hV08zblNyZmh2eTV5czdTNkhuX3V3V01CLXFyaQ</guid></item><item><title>专家说，世界上超过60 ％的人缺乏这种1维生素—这会增加您生病的风险- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillianwilson/vitamin-d-deficiency-colds-covid-viruses</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;It’s common for PCPs to recommend between 1,000 to 2,000 IUs per day of vitamin D3, Stadler said. Holick thinks adults should be on a higher amount than this, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, I recommend adults should be on minimum 2,000 units per day — and most I recommend 5,000 units a day because you want to get your blood level, in my opinion, of [vitamin D] between 40 and 60 ng/mL, [but] up to 100 is perfectly safe,” said Holick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get the go-ahead from your doctor, you can buy vitamin D supplements online or in stores like CVS and Walgreens. You’ll likely find vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 on the shelves, but vitamin D3 is more readily available and tends to be more recommended. Holick said vitamin D2 is perfectly acceptable, too, and is often preferred by vegans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s better to get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; nutrients directly from food, that isn’t easy or potentially even possible with vitamin D. Oily fish, milk and orange juice are all good for increasing vitamin D levels, but can’t do so to the level necessary, said Holick. The same goes for the sun, which also carries a risk of skin cancer with too much exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holick said he recommends vitamin D supplementation to all of his patients, friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot get enough from your diet. You aren’t able to get enough from sunlight, unless you’re a ... hunter-gatherer, so vitamin D supplementation is essential,” Holick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults and people with darker skin are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, Stadler added. But, once again, it’s advisable for most people to take a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

His departure in the coming days means nearly half the 27 NIH divisions will have interim leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koroshetz sent an email to NINDS staff late Friday night explaining that a request to reappoint him was denied, adding that his current temporary extension ends Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s some possibility for a short term extension, but iffy at best,” he wrote in an email obtained by STAT.&lt;/p&gt;

The state came down with a record-breaking 71,123 cases the week ending Dec. 20 — the highest since flu became a reportable disease in 2004, officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 15,000 of those lab-confirmed flu cases &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/new-york-state-flu-tracker"&gt;were on Long Island&lt;/a&gt; during that period — 7,924 in Nassau and 7,571 in Suffolk, state data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing the highest number of flu cases ever recorded in a single week,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement, adding that the agency is monitoring hospital bed capacity “to better understand hospitalization trends and to guide any necessary response related to impacts from respiratory viral infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State hospitalizations &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/respiratory_viruses/activity/2025-2026/docs/current_respiratory_report.pdf"&gt;due to influenza went up 63% &lt;/a&gt;over the last two reporting weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="/news/health/flu-cases-ahead-uwosj55h"&gt;Experts have warned of a likely severe flu season&lt;/a&gt; attributed to low vaccination rates and a surprise variant that emerged after the vaccine was formulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide, there have been 189,312 positive flu cases reported since October, including &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/new-york-state-flu-tracker"&gt;20,415 in Nassau and 18,109 in Suffolk&lt;/a&gt;. Infectious disease doctors have said lab-confirmed tests represent only a portion of actual flu cases because many people who are sick may not seek medical help or get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospitalization rate in Suffolk County more than doubled over the last two weeks, from 8.79 to 20.38 per 100,000 people, while Nassau County's increased from 15.4 to 23.2 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials noted that reporting of flu cases has gone up in recent years due to increased testing but "the record number underscores that this season is impacting more people than in other recent years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald advised all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated against the flu, and stay home when they get sick. People at higher risk of severe flu, such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, can benefit from antiviral medication if it is administered within 48 hours of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the current flu vaccine is not a perfect match to the circulating strain, it is still worth getting, said Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of public health and epidemiology at Northwell Health, during a briefing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The flu vaccine] is very good at preventing hospitalizations and deaths,” he said. “It's not as good at preventing flu per se, but if you get flu, more likely than not, it will be a lot less severe than if you are not vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data"&gt;25% of eligible New Yorkers&lt;/a&gt; have received flu shots as of Dec. 24, including 20% in Suffolk County and 24% in Nassau County. The state Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended the flu vaccine for everyone over the age of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

Their work also points to a potential strategy for lowering that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining modern laboratory techniques with previously published data from vaccinated individuals, the team uncovered a two-stage immune response. In this process, the vaccine activates one type of immune cell, which then stimulates another. Together, these immune reactions drive inflammation that can damage heart muscle cells and set off additional inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines Remain Highly Safe and Effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come despite the fact that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been given billions of times worldwide and continue to show an excellent safety record, said Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The mRNA vaccines have done a tremendous job mitigating the COVID pandemic," said Wu, the Simon H. Stertzer, MD, Professor and a professor of medicine and of radiology. "Without these vaccines, more people would have gotten sick, more people would have had severe effects and more people would have died."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mRNA vaccines are considered a major advance because they can be developed quickly, adjusted as viruses change, and tailored to target very different pathogens. Still, as with any medical intervention, reactions are not identical for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Vaccine-Associated Myocarditis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One uncommon but documented side effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is myocarditis, which refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and heart palpitations. These symptoms occur without a viral infection and typically appear within one to three days after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most affected individuals show elevated levels of cardiac troponin in their blood, a widely used marker of heart muscle injury. (Cardiac troponin is normally found exclusively in the heart muscle. When found circulating in blood, it indicates damage to heart muscle cells.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition occurs in roughly one out of every 140,000 people after a first vaccine dose and increases to about one in 32,000 after a second dose. Rates are highest among males age 30 and younger, where it affects about one in 16,750 vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcomes Are Usually Mild and Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu emphasized that the majority of myocarditis cases linked to vaccination resolve quickly, with heart function either fully preserved or restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's not a heart attack in the traditional sense," he said. "There's no blockage of blood vessels as found in most common heart attacks. When symptoms are mild and the inflammation hasn't caused structural damage to the heart, we just observe these patients to make sure they recover."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rare instances, however, severe inflammation can cause serious injury, leading to hospitalization, intensive care treatment or death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But COVID's worse," Wu said. He noted that a COVID-19 infection is about 10 times more likely to cause myocarditis than an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the many other risks posed by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Closer Look at the Immune Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu is a senior author of the study, publisded Dec. 10 in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, along with Masataka Nishiga, MD, PhD, a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar now at The Ohio State University. The study's lead author is Xu Cao, PhD, also a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Medical scientists are quite aware that COVID itself can cause myocarditis," Wu said. "To a lesser extent, so can the mRNA vaccines. The question is, why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspects Identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, the team analyzed blood samples from vaccinated individuals, including some who developed myocarditis. When they compared these samples with those from people who did not develop heart inflammation, two proteins stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Two proteins, named CXCL10 and IFN-gamma, popped up. We think these two are the major drivers of myocarditis," Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CXCL10 and IFN-gamma are cytokines, signaling molecules that immune cells use to communicate and coordinate their activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Immune Cells Interact After Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers grew human immune cells called macrophages in laboratory dishes and exposed them to mRNA vaccines. Macrophages act as early responders in immune defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exposure, the macrophages released multiple cytokines, with especially high levels of CXCL10. Their behavior closely matched immune responses previously documented in vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When T cells were added to the system, either directly or by exposing them to fluid from the macrophage cultures, the T cells began producing large amounts of IFN-gamma. In contrast, T cells exposed to the vaccine alone did not show this spike. These findings showed that macrophages primarily produce CXCL10, while T cells are the main source of IFN-gamma following vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Cytokines Affect the Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether these cytokines directly harm the heart, the team vaccinated young male mice and observed increased cardiac troponin levels, indicating heart muscle injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also found that immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, had entered heart tissue. Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells that respond aggressively to threats and are a major component of pus. Similar immune cell infiltration is seen in people who develop myocarditis after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocking CXCL10 and IFN-gamma reduced the number of these immune cells entering the heart and limited damage to healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also detected increased levels of adhesion molecules in heart blood vessels. These molecules help immune cells latch onto vessel walls, making it easier for them to move into heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings confirmed that CXCL10 and IFN-gamma directly contribute to heart injury. Blocking them preserved much of the immune response to vaccination while lowering signs of heart damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Human Heart Tissue Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu's lab specializes in converting human skin or blood cells into stem-like cells that can become heart muscle cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells. These cells can be assembled into small, beating clusters that mimic aspects of heart function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these cardiac spheroids were exposed to CXCL10 and IFN-gamma collected from vaccinated immune cells, markers of heart stress rose sharply. Using inhibitors to block the cytokines reduced this damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of heart function, including contraction strength and beating rhythm, were impaired by the cytokines but improved once the signaling was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saved by a Soybean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu suspected that a widely available dietary compound might help protect the heart. Since myocarditis is more common in males and estrogen has anti-inflammatory effects, he revisited genistein, a soy-derived compound his team had studied previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study published in Cell, the researchers showed that genistein has anti-inflammatory properties and can counter marijuana-related damage to blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genistein is only weakly absorbed when taken orally," Wu said. "Nobody ever overdosed on tofu."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Genistein's Protective Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team repeated their experiments while pre-treating cells, cardiac spheroids and mice (the latter by oral administration of large quantities) with genistein. This treatment reduced much of the heart damage caused by either mRNA vaccination or the CXCL10 and IFN-gamma combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form of genistein used in the study was more purified and concentrated than supplements commonly sold in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's reasonable to believe that the mRNA-vaccine-induced inflammatory response may extend to other organs," Wu said. "We and others have seen some evidence of this in lung, liver and kidney. It's possible that genistein may also reverse these changes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications Beyond COVID Vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heightened cytokine signaling may be a broader feature of mRNA vaccines. IFN-gamma, in particular, plays a critical role in defending the body against foreign DNA and RNA, including viral genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your body needs these cytokines to ward off viruses. It's essential to immune response but can become toxic in large amounts," Wu said. Excessive IFN-gamma can lead to myocarditis-like symptoms and breakdown of heart muscle proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This risk is not limited to COVID vaccines alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other vaccines can cause myocarditis and inflammatory problems, but the symptoms tend to be more diffuse," Wu said. "Plus, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines' risks have received intense public scrutiny and media coverage. If you get chest pains from a COVID vaccine you go to the hospital to get checked out, and if the serum troponin is positive, then you get diagnosed with myocarditis. If you get achy muscles or joints from a flu vaccine, you just blow it off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01 HL113006, R01 HL141371, R01 HL141851, R01 HL163680 and R01 HL176822) and the Gootter-Jensen Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists explain that the human body operates on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/circadian-rhythms" target="_blank"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, internal 24 hour cycles that influence metabolism, hormone release and glucose control. These rhythms are highly sensitive to light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_126206028" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-126206028"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that artificial light at night can disrupt these cycles and raise blood sugar levels. Conversely, spending time outdoors in daylight appears to improve the body’s response to insulin. What remained unclear until now was whether similar benefits could be achieved indoors through natural light alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside the study rooms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, researchers led by Joris Hoeks at Maastricht University in the Netherlands conducted a small but closely monitored experiment involving 13 older adults with type 2 diabetes. According to the New Scientist report, participants spent 4.5 days in rooms where they were exposed to daylight through large windows from morning to evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They followed controlled routines. Meals, exercise and sleep schedules were kept consistent. Participants continued their usual diabetes medications and spent most of the day seated, using phones and computers with dim screen settings. Nights involved low artificial lighting before sleep in complete darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_126206028" id="div-vdoai-mid-126206028"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same participants later repeated the experiment in windowless rooms lit only by artificial light, allowing researchers to compare the two environments directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-msid="126206028" class="masterclass_carousel"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-126206028" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the blood sugar data revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose monitors showed that during the days spent with natural light exposure, participants stayed within a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/healthy-blood-sugar-range" target="_blank"&gt;healthy blood sugar range&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; about 50 percent of the time. During the artificial light phase, that figure dropped to 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-126206028" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-126206028" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-126206028" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the difference may appear modest, Hoeks told New Scientist that prolonged periods outside the healthy range can meaningfully increase the risk of diabetes related complications such as heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers defined healthy blood sugar levels in line with guidance from health authorities such as the UK National Health Service and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why light through a window matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the effect may stem from light sensitive cells in the eyes that help regulate metabolic cycles. These cells respond more strongly to the shorter wavelengths found in natural daylight than to artificial lighting, potentially reinforcing healthier circadian signals throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the exact biological mechanisms require further investigation, the implication is clear. Exposure to daylight does not require strenuous effort, special equipment or lifestyle overhaul. Experts caution that larger studies are needed before drawing firm conclusions. Glen Jeffery from University College London, quoted in New Scientist, noted that scientific understanding of daylight’s importance is still developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the takeaway is striking in its simplicity. For many people with type 2 diabetes, improving blood sugar control may begin with something that also lifts mood and mental clarity. Sitting by a window, letting daylight shape the day, could be one small but meaningful step toward better metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 15:35:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新研究揭示糖尿病对人类心脏进行物理重新布线- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/new-study-reveals-diabetes-physically-rewires-the-human-heart/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 15:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNbGQ2NzRfTDQ4cldXOEZCNEcwdEVUMEJMYUY1WnBPYkJnemNiemRJUWRFVTk2VUx6bUZxV1VaSF9TNk1KVndfLWVMQUpsRGwyQ05MTEwzQVdTVkZNU1c3NFZkaFpGTGk1NVNhQklMVkZYUExrVkRtcEhfaWlZTGYwUHJvQlRsSURydUt1eXZxSnQ</guid></item><item><title>可能增加炎症的“健康”习惯- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/healthy-habits-that-may-increase-inflammation-11874610</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to daily habits to support our health, it’s easy to assume our routines are helping us. But sometimes, what seems “healthy” on the surface can put too much stress on the body and contribute to chronic inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-overexercising"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Overexercising &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overexercising is often admired as the ultimate display of discipline and determination. But pushing your body too hard or too often can do more harm than good. “Overexercising can lead to chronic stress on the body, elevating cortisol levels and causing microtears in muscles that don’t have adequate time to repair [themselves],” says &lt;a href="https://theorganicdietitian.com/about-me-2/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sara Koreniewski, RD, FDN-P&lt;/a&gt;. “This creates a state of systemic inflammation as the body struggles to recover.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is especially true for intense or prolonged training without sufficient recovery periods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that very long, intense workouts trigger the body to release pro-inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, chronic overexercising—or “overtraining syndrome”—can lead to frequent injuries, persistent fatigue, joint pain and a weakened immune system, adds Koreniewski.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While moderate- to high-intensity exercise supports cardiovascular health, it’s important to prioritize adequate rest and recovery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Instead of chasing harder and longer sessions, Koreniewski recommends a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833111/exercise-when-you-have-no-time/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced exercise routine&lt;/a&gt; that includes rest days, gentle movement like yoga or walking, and recovery strategies such as quality sleep and proper nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-undereating"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Undereating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From skipped meals to very small portions, many people assume that undereating is necessary for weight loss. However, consistently undernourishing your body can quietly work against your health goals. “Undereating deprives the body of essential nutrients needed for cellular repair and energy production, leading to low energy and triggering the cell danger response,” says Koreniewski. The “cell danger response” is a protective stress reaction in cells that, when chronically activated, can increase inflammation. This can lead to chronic inflammation as the body perceives a threat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Couple undereating with overexercising, and you’ve created a recipe for even more inflammation. “Without enough fuel, your immune system and tissues can’t repair [themselves] properly, while intense exercise adds extra stress and oxidative damage,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionrewired.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erin Kenney, M.S., RD, LDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “Studies show that not getting enough calories while training can raise inflammation and make recovery harder.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both dietitians note that hair thinning, brittle nails, brain fog, irritability, ongoing fatigue, decreased athletic performance and persistent muscle soreness are all signs of energy depletion and underfueling.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They recommend working with a registered dietitian to ensure you’re eating enough to meet your activity needs, and practicing mindful eating to reconnect with your body’s hunger and fullness cues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-taking-too-many-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Taking Too Many Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to assume that the more supplements you take, the better your health will be. But &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/too-many-supplements-11708988" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;taking too many supplements&lt;/a&gt; may increase inflammation. “Supplements, while intended to support health, can overwhelm the body’s detoxification systems (e.g., liver, gut) and nervous system, especially if they’re unnecessary or poorly matched to your needs,” says Koreniewski. “This can create biochemical imbalances and add stress to an already dysregulated system.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, “high-dose vitamin A can accumulate in the body, disrupting immune signaling and increasing inflammation,” says Kenney.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She also notes that high-dose conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplements or very high omega-6 intake without sufficient omega-3s may promote pro-inflammatory pathways in some people.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, taking high-dose iron supplements without a clear deficiency or clinical need can increase oxidative stress and trigger inflammatory responses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Herbal supplements are another area of concern. Inappropriate use of herbal products has been linked with higher risk of liver damage and chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The key is to use supplements only when needed, preferably get nutrients from whole foods and monitor for signs of fatigue, digestive upset or liver strain,” adds Kenney.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-overexertion-and-chronic-stress"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Overexertion and Chronic Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Busy schedules and pushing your mind and body beyond their limits are often framed as being driven and productive—but this approach can backfire. “Constantly pushing past physical, emotional or mental limits activates the nervous system’s fight-or-flight response, leading to dysregulation and chronic stress,” says Koreniewski. She explains that this ongoing stress stress perpetuates inflammation, as the body remains in a heightened state of alert.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But how exactly is it linked to inflammation? Kenney notes that chronic stress from overworking can increase inflammation by keeping cortisol levels elevated and activating the immune system, leading to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased inflammatory markers&lt;/a&gt;, such as C-reactive protein (CRP).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, “research shows that working more than about 61 hours per week is linked to higher CRP compared with working under 40 hours,” she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Signs of chronic stress-related inflammation include fatigue, trouble sleeping, mood swings, anxiety, headaches, digestive issues and frequent illness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To combat this, Kenney recommends setting clear work boundaries, prioritizing rest, practicing stress-management techniques like mindfulness or nature walks, and committing to regular personal downtime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-prolonged-fasting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Prolonged Fasting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many people turn to fasting for potential health benefits like weight loss, improved metabolic health and longevity, taking it too far can have unintended consequences. Koreniewski cautions that although short-term fasting may be beneficial for some, prolonged fasting can temporarily increase inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that fasting for 48 hours or longer is associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers, including CRP, IL-6)and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Importantly, these markers usually return to baseline after refeeding, indicating that the rise in inflammation is likely a temporary stress response rather than permanent damage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, certain groups may be more susceptible to inflammation-related effects. People with preexisting conditions, such as heart disease, or those taking oral contraceptives may face additional risks from prolonged fasting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Symptoms such as dizziness, irritability, trouble concentrating and hormonal disruptions can signal that prolonged fasting is placing too much stress on the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those interested in fasting, Koreniewski recommends a more balanced approach, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676144/mistakes-you-can-make-while-intermittent-fasting/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gentle fasting windows&lt;/a&gt; of 12 to 14 hours, and emphasizes listening to your body’s signals to avoid overdoing it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the habits we consider “healthy” are often rooted in good intentions. But when taken to extremes, they can place constant strain on the body and quietly contribute to chronic inflammation. True healthy habits focus on what your body can actually sustain, like finding balance with exercise, managing busy schedules and nourishing yourself properly. By making small, thoughtful adjustments that prioritize recovery, balance and proper nutrition, your routine can support your body rather than work against it.

&lt;p&gt;Millions now proudly embrace labels like “Viking,” “Yamnaya,” or “Greek and Balkan.” But leading scientists warn: these test results are not what they seem. The categories they offer are built on assumptions, approximations, and genetic illusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to geneticist &lt;strong&gt;Carles Lalueza-Fox&lt;/strong&gt;, the narratives sold by companies like &lt;em&gt;23andMe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ancestry.com&lt;/em&gt; often oversimplify, or even distort, what DNA can truly reveal. While customers may feel connected to a grand historical lineage, the science behind these tests is far more complex, and far less definitive, than advertised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, learning they are “&lt;em&gt;part Viking&lt;/em&gt;” feels like a personal discovery. But experts argue that these interpretations don’t hold up under scrutiny. The labels used in consumer DNA reports are based on rough estimates of genetic similarity to ancient populations, which themselves are arbitrarily defined. They are neither universal, nor objective, and most importantly, they don’t reflect the real, messy history of human migration and genetic mixing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reference Populations Are Scientific Constructs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancestry tests&lt;/strong&gt; rely on comparisons between your DNA and those of so-called “&lt;em&gt;reference populations&lt;/em&gt;.” These populations are usually built from ancient genomes taken from archaeological samples, assigned labels like “Romans,” “Steppe nomads,” “Anglo-Saxons,” or “Slavs.” But as Lalueza-Fox &lt;a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/dna-and-its-discontents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, these categories are not fixed. Scientists select them based on their specific research goals, and their definitions can vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These classifications create the illusion of a static human past, where populations stayed in one place long enough to develop isolated genetic identities. In reality, human movement has been constant. From the &lt;em&gt;Out-of-Africa&lt;/em&gt; migration some &lt;strong&gt;60,000 to 70,000 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;, to the forced displacements of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Slave Trade&lt;/em&gt; starting in the 16th century, history has been defined by mobility. That mixing makes it nearly impossible to tie a person’s genome to a single place or group with any real certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if a person’s &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/dna-reveals-story-of-beachy-head-woman/" data-type="post" data-id="100171"&gt;DNA &lt;/a&gt;shows similarities with ancient genomes from Viking-era Scandinavia, that doesn’t mean they are “&lt;em&gt;part Viking&lt;/em&gt;.” According to Lalueza-Fox, these associations are built on statistical approximations, not concrete genealogical links. Genetic ancestry testing offers resemblance, not lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Diversity Is Extremely Limited&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a glance, human beings appear strikingly diverse. We differ in skin tone, facial structure, height, disease resistance, and more. But genetically, humans are among the least diverse species on the planet. Approximately 99.9% of the human genome is shared by all people. The remaining 0.1% accounts for the small genetic variations that tests analyze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In population genetics, defining a “&lt;em&gt;population&lt;/em&gt;” is also fraught with complexity. In theory, it means a group of individuals that mate among themselves and are distinct from others. But in practice, especially with humans, these boundaries are blurred. No human group is truly isolated, and traits like language or geography don’t always correspond with distinct genetics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this, geneticists &lt;em&gt;James Kitchens&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Graham Coop&lt;/em&gt; visualized the scale of human genetic variation. Starting with 2.9 billion nucleotide sites, they analyzed 609 individuals from the Americas and found only 39 million observable variants. Restricting the analysis to common variants, those found in more than 5% of people’s chromosomes, reduced the number to 10 million. That’s a minuscule portion of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also found that the vast majority of these variants are &lt;em&gt;not exclusive&lt;/em&gt; to any single population. In one example, 99 Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry showed 5,726,377 variants, while 96 African Caribbeans from Barbados had 8,018,649. The overlap was massive. According to the findings, even variants considered “&lt;em&gt;regional&lt;/em&gt;” are typically present in multiple parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Race and Identity in Genetics Are Collapsing Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outdated concept of “race” still influences how people interpret genetic ancestry, but the science has moved on. While some visible traits, like skin pigmentation, show clear geographic trends, full-genome studies have revealed that these patterns are superficial. According to &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/genetic/your-dna-might-say-viking-but-science-says-genetic-ancestry-tests-never-tell-the-whole-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZME Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, humans exhibit gradual genetic variation across continents, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; distinct racial boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift is reflected in the scientific literature. The use of the term “Caucasian,” once common in population genetics papers, has dropped dramatically, from 12% in the mid-20th century to less than 1% in the early 2000s. In its place, broader continental terms like “European” gained popularity, rising to 42% of papers between 2009 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet even these continental categories are imperfect. Comparing a relatively homogenous island nation like &lt;em&gt;Iceland&lt;/em&gt; to a vast and diverse territory like &lt;em&gt;Russia&lt;/em&gt; reveals the limitations of grouping people by nationality. Scientists have adopted different approaches; some define populations by country, others by culture, but both methods come with significant trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In non-human species, the situation is clearer. Isolated populations like &lt;em&gt;Madagascar lemurs&lt;/em&gt; or the extinct &lt;em&gt;dodo&lt;/em&gt; of Mauritius show well-defined genetic distinctions due to physical separation. But humans have always been connected. The concept of &lt;em&gt;“endemism&lt;/em&gt;,” where a species is confined to a specific location, simply doesn’t apply to our species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of broad population models, modern geneticists increasingly work with ancient individuals tied to specific places and periods. This allows them to reconstruct movement and change over time without assigning modern identities to ancient people. According to Lalueza-Fox, this method offers a more accurate, nuanced view of the past, without collapsing it into modern labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you've ever struggled with constipation, you know how miserable it can be. But the good news is you have more control over your condition than you might think. For starters, your breakfast, specifically, a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easy-15-minute-high-fiber-breakfast-recipes-8728534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber morning meal&lt;/a&gt;, can make a big difference in keeping things moving smoothly.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does a high-fiber breakfast that will help you poop look like? It might be different from what you think. Forget boring bowls of bran cereal.

Whether you prefer something sweet or savory, the key is combining a variety of foods that contain different types of fiber with other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-to-support-gut-health-11791719" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gut-supporting nutrients&lt;/a&gt;. This includes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes. Of course, it helps to choose foods you also enjoy eating.

The mix of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;soluble and insoluble fibers&lt;/a&gt; works together to support healthy digestion, while the soaked oats become easier for your body to process. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This muesli recipe yields 4 servings that each provide a generous 15 grams of fiber per serving," says &lt;a href="https://www.nyit.edu/bio/mindy-haar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mindy Haar, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides delivering the fiber your gut needs, this muesli is also nutrient-dense, providing vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, iron and potassium. The nuts bring heart- and brain-healthy monounsaturated fats to your bowl that add staying power to keep you satisfied all morning.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Constipation can be caused by a lack of fiber and hydration.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats are a make-ahead breakfast winner, especially when you're looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287743/6-high-fiber-food-swaps-to-make-right-now/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These overnight oats pack 9 grams of fiber per serving, half of it soluble and half insoluble fiber, according to Haar. The yogurt makes it a protein powerhouse while adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/probiotic-rich-foods-that-are-not-yogurt-11794516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beneficial probiotics&lt;/a&gt; for your gut. Thanks to the orange juice, you'll also get a shot of vitamin C, plus magnesium, folate, iron and potassium.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast doesn’t have to always lean toward sweet. This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-vegetable-breakfast-grain-bowl-8742347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl&lt;/a&gt; is a savory grain bowl loaded with roasted vegetables and is a nutritional powerhouse. "While this may not be what Americans think of eating for breakfast, savory grain and vegetable meals can get the day off to a nutritious, high-fiber start," says Haar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 16 grams of fiber per serving, this hearty bowl keeps you full and supports regularity.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And at 534 calories with a good amount of healthy fats, it works as a substantial meal that provides vitamin C, vitamin B12, folate, magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin A and potassium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Orange-Peach Chia Seed Smoothie &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smoothies can be an easy way to pack in fiber for busy mornings when you need breakfast on the go. This refreshing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/orange-peach-chia-seed-smoothie-11817673" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Orange-Peach Chia Seed Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; blends juicy oranges and peaches with fiber-rich chia seeds for a drink that supports digestive health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This smoothie is a wonderful gut-supportive option because the chia seeds deliver soluble fiber, which helps form a gentle gel in the digestive tract and keeps things moving regularly," explains &lt;a href="https://www.vitalrd.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jessica Crandall Snyder, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fruit adds both hydration and additional fiber for smooth digestion. "This combination of fluid, soluble fiber and easy-to-digest blended fruit can be especially helpful for maintaining regularity," adds Snyder.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-chocolatebanana-bread-baked-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Chocolate–Banana Bread Baked Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking for something warm and comforting? These &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chocolate-banana-bread-baked-oats-11795176" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chocolate-Banana Bread Baked Oats&lt;/a&gt; are your solution. The whole-grain oats provide beta-glucan fiber that feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, while ripe bananas contribute natural sweetness and additional fiber.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The result is a satisfying breakfast that supports regularity without overwhelming your system. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "That combination helps the meal stay filling but gentle on the digestive tract, and the warm, comforting texture can make it easier to digest than heavier or high-fat breakfasts," says Snyder. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turn breakfast into something fun with a playful take on a classic dessert, like we do with this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7984982/kiwi-granola-breakfast-banana-split/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kiwi-Granola Breakfast Banana Split&lt;/a&gt;. "This clever breakfast banana split delivers fiber from multiple sources, banana, kiwi, and whole-grain granola with nuts or seeds," says Snyder. "This breakfast offers a balanced way to support bowel regularity and reduce constipation risk without causing the discomfort that can come from very bulky or high-fat morning meals." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, the yogurt adds filling protein and creates a creamy, gut-friendly, probiotic-rich base. Probiotics are beneficial gut bacteria. They require a food source to thrive and multiply—and fiber happens to be their favorite. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans at breakfast might sound unusual to some, but they're one of the most effective foods for supporting digestive health. This savory &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/black-bean-pepper-jack-quiche-11778332" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Black Bean &amp;amp; Pepper Jack Quiche&lt;/a&gt; combines protein-rich eggs with fiber-filled black beans for a filling meal that keeps things moving.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, says that beans are one of her favorite fiber-providing foods. On its own, this quiche provides 6 grams of fiber per serving, but you could boost that even more by adding sliced avocado and salsa on the side. Beyond just fiber, Sauceda notes that beans have been found to positively influence gut bacteria and contain carbohydrates with prebiotic potential.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Prebiotics feed your gut’s beneficial bacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;

Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes with Blueberry Sauce &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, pancakes can support your digestive health, especially when they’re these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-poppyseed-pancakes-with-blueberry-sauce-8599338" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes with Blueberry Sauce&lt;/a&gt;—not your typical white-flour flapjacks. "What makes these pancakes special are the ingredients, whole-wheat flour and blueberries," explains Sauceda. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By using whole-wheat flour instead of refined flour, you automatically increase the fiber content. The fiber in whole wheat has been shown to increase short-chain fatty acids, which are beneficial compounds for your gut barrier.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The blueberries also support gut health by bringing their fiber to the sauce, and may help improve digestive discomfort symptoms.
&lt;/p&gt;

Tofu Scramble with Spinach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu scrambles are incredibly versatile, making them perfect for using up whatever vegetables you have on hand while boosting your fiber intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "What makes this scramble great for your gut is the tofu," says Sauceda. Soy contains carbohydrates that can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, and soy isoflavones may positively influence gut bacteria.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add some chia seeds.&lt;/strong&gt; Chia seeds make a nice addition to many breakfast foods, including oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies and baked goods. Sauceda likes to sprinkle them into pancake batter for extra protein and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a goal. &lt;/strong&gt;When planning for your morning meals, it's a good idea to aim for at least 5 grams of fiber per serving, says Haar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oatmeal isn't required.&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it's a great source of fiber, but if you don't like it, don't eat it. High fiber fruits, like apples and berries, are staples of breakfast for Sauceda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;Don't forget to drink water! "Fiber works best when you've had enough fluid," says Haar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat your leftovers.&lt;/strong&gt; "If you're not a breakfast person, then go savory and think of dinner for breakfast. I've been known to just reheat last night's leftovers," says Sauceda.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A high-fiber breakfast is one of the most effective—and delicious—ways to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support regular bowel movements&lt;/a&gt; and overall digestive health. The key is choosing foods that deliver at least 5 grams of fiber per serving while combining different types of fiber. Soluble fiber forms a gentle gel in your digestive tract, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to help keep things moving along. Whether you prefer sweet options like overnight oats and smoothies or savory choices like breakfast grain bowls and tofu scrambles, there are plenty of tasty ways to start your day with gut-friendly fiber. Just remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day, since fiber works best when you're well-hydrated.

			&lt;p&gt;When you look at clouds, tree bark, or the front of a car, do you sometimes see a face staring back at you? That's "face pareidolia" and it is a perfectly normal illusion where our brains spot faces in patterns that aren't actually faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, these illusions are harmless. But my new &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/03010066251387849"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Perception&lt;/em&gt;, suggests people with visual snow syndrome – a rare neurological condition that causes constant "visual static" – experience this phenomenon more strongly and more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding offers a unique window into how an overactive brain may amplify the erroneous illusory patterns it sees in the world. It also shows how perception isn't a perfect mirror of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-discovery-on-mars-looks-exactly-like-a-human-face"&gt;Eerie Discovery on Mars Looks Exactly Like a Human Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is visual snow syndrome?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual snow syndrome is characterised by the persistent perception of flickering dots, like television static, across the entire field of vision. People with the condition often report the dots never go away, even in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of this syndrome remains unclear, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000001258"&gt;recent evidence&lt;/a&gt; points to hyperexcitability in the visual cortex, the region of the brain that interprets what we see. In essence, the neurons responsible for processing visual information may be firing too readily, flooding perception with noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many individuals with visual snow syndrome also experience migraines, light sensitivity, afterimages or visual trails that linger after motion. These symptoms can make everyday visual experiences confusing and exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite growing awareness, the condition remains under-diagnosed and poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Testing how 'visual snow' shapes perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether this hyperactive visual system changes how people interpret ambiguous visual input, our research team invited more than 250 volunteers to complete an online experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed a short questionnaire to determine whether they experienced symptoms of visual snow. They were then shown 320 images of everyday objects, from tree trunks to cups of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="186740" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, and asked to rate, on a scale from 0 to 100, how easily they could see a face in each image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 132 people met the criteria for visual snow syndrome, while 104 formed a control group matched for age. We also tracked whether participants experienced migraines, allowing us to compare four subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A collection of fruit and vegetables, half of which are covered in static." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=401&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=401&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=401&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=504&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=504&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/699339/original/file-20251030-64-orkzhx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=504&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;People with visual snow often report the dots never go away, even in the dark.

Goadsby/Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-NC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The brain that sees too much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. People with visual snow consistently gave higher "face scores" to each and every image than those without the condition. This suggests they were more likely to see faces in random textures and objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with both visual snow and migraines scored highest of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern was remarkably consistent. In general, the groups agreed on which images looked most like faces, but the visual snow group reported seeing illusory faces more vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the same objects triggered a stronger illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results align with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-023-02435-w"&gt;earlier theories&lt;/a&gt; that the visual snow brain is hyper-responsive. Normally, our visual system generates quick, low-level "guesses" about what we're seeing, followed by slower checks to confirm those guesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that feedback loop is disrupted by excessive neural activity, an early "false alarm", such as mistaking an object for a face, may be amplified rather than corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why migraine makes it stronger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraine and visual snow have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2021.05.012"&gt;frequently linked&lt;/a&gt;, and both involve abnormally high levels of cortical activity. During a migraine, visual neurons can become hypersensitive to flicker, light and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that when migraine and visual snow occur together, the brain's sensitivity to illusory faces increases even further. This may reflect a shared neural pathway underlying both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could use this relationship to develop new diagnostic tools. Face pareidolia tests are quick, accessible, and could be adapted for children or nonverbal patients who can't easily describe what they see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new way to understand perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face pareidolia isn't a disorder – it's a side effect of a perceptual system that prioritises social information. Evolution has biased our visual system to spot faces first and ask questions later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with visual snow, that system may be dialled up too high. Their brains may "connect the dots" in visual noise, interpreting ambiguous input as meaningful patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding supports the idea that visual snow is not just a vision problem but a broader disturbance in how the brain interprets visual input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding why some people see too much, we can learn more about how all of us see at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual snow syndrome is often dismissed or misdiagnosed, leaving patients frustrated. Linking the condition to a measurable illusion such as face pareidolia gives clinicians a tangible sign of the altered brain activity behind the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also humanises the experience. People with visual snow aren't imagining their perceptions – their brains are genuinely processing the world differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond diagnosis, this research contributes to a bigger question in neuroscience: how does the brain strike a balance between sensitivity and accuracy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too little activity, and we miss the signal. Too much, and we start to see faces in the snow.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267007/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
