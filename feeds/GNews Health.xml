Viewers are finding them enlightening and comforting as many people  — mainly women — are undiagnosed as they reach adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://neurodivergentinsights.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Megan Anna Neff;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Megan Anna Neff&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Oregon, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35204992/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a recent study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that 80% of women with autism are still undiagnosed at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many reasons for this: For starters, people learn to adjust their behavior to fit in with society. Additionally,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the autism diagnostic tools used today were developed exclusively on white boys from high socioeconomic status, said &lt;a href="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephanie Gardner-Wright;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stephanie Gardner-Wright&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed master social worker and certified autism clinical specialist in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is also a huge focus on the external signs and not so much the internal symptoms of autism, Gardner-Wright said. And those internal symptoms are very different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are so many ways that autism can show up and present,” Neff added. “I think there’s more diversity within autism than there is between autism and allistic.” (Allistic people are folks who aren’t on the autism spectrum.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, there are a number of signs or thought patterns that undiagnosed autistic people may be able to relate to. HuffPost spoke with mental health professionals, including some people who are neurodivergent themselves, about the signs of autism in adulthood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Feeling Of Being ‘Different’ From Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Pixelcatchers / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurengarafano/doctors-share-little-things-people-ignore?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors Are Sharing The 16 &amp;quot;Tiny&amp;quot; Health Things That Most People Ignore But 100% Shouldn't;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors Are Sharing The 16 "Tiny" Health Things That Most People Ignore But 100% Shouldn't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All four experts shared that it’s common for autistic people to feel different. &lt;a href="https://effectiveartistry.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brandon Tessers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Brandon Tessers&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Effective Artistry, a therapy group that supports neurodivergent people, said some folks will describe it as “feeling like an alien sometimes,” while &lt;a href="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Vanessa Bal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Vanessa Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Adult Autism Services Psychological Services Clinic at Rutgers University in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; said folks describe it as “a lifetime experience of feeling different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference between this feeling and the occasional outsider feeling everyone deals with from time to time is that for autistic folks, this feeling does not come and go and is not only during one specific period, like middle school, Bal told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that this is a big indicator and an internal experience at that — you cannot look at a person and know if they feel like an outsider. The feeling could be overpowering or could be more subtle, it depends on the person, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, it’s important to know that autistic people don’t necessarily feel like outsiders all the time, Bal noted. They may find settings that are more inclusive for neurodivergent people. Additionally, some adults also say they feel more comfortable with who they are and worry less about differences, sometimes seeing them as strengths, as they get older, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty With Social Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oliver Rossi / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Social cues are also another sign. Someone with undiagnosed autism may find they have trouble deciphering how much eye contact is appropriate or when they should stop smiling during a conversation, Gardner-Wright said. They may be able to mask these uncertainties by learning how much is appropriate, but it’s not an innate sense as it is with someone who is allistic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Confusing Relationship History — Both Romantically Or Platonically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Peopleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Neff, many undiagnosed autistic adults have a confusing and complicated social relationship history. Additionally, romantic relationships may feel tough to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There might be relationships that have that kind of suddenly burst apart but the autistic person doesn’t understand why,” she said. When it comes to the reason behind this complicated relationship history, it’s likely that the person with autism doesn’t know why their relationships fail when other people’s don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/scarymouse/doctors-sharing-mild-symptoms-actually-serious-medical-3?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Get To The Doctor Right Now" — People Are Revealing 24 "Mild" Medical Symptoms That Can Actually Be A Sign Of A Major, Major Issue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;"Get To The Doctor Right Now" — People Are Revealing 24 "Mild" Medical Symptoms That Can Actually Be A Sign Of A Major, Major Issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Simpleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sensitivity to sensory input — like noise and sight — is another potential sign of autism, said Gardner-Wright, who added that this can mean being hyper-aware of a sound or totally unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are not autistic tend to be more or less responsive to sensory stimuli, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, an autistic person may find that they’re constantly aware of a ticking clock at a friend’s house or really sensitive to the sound of a loud siren, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tatiana Maksimova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people with autism thrive on consistency. “The world we occupy is much more uncertain and unpredictable. So we go to routine as a way of self-soothing,” Neff said. When a routine is disrupted, strong &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/which-human-emotion-are-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emotions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; may present, including intense irritability or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that the routine doesn’t need to be super strict, either; it’s a common misconception when people think about people with autism’s day-to-day schedule. Instead, it could be a strong preference for a certain mug every morning. Routine looks different for different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, big changes can be hard, too. “If they move [homes] or they move careers, this could create a season of insomnia or anxiety,” Neff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Routine can extend to certain behaviors as well. It also includes repetitive body movements, which is known as stimming, Neff added. &lt;a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, stimming behaviors can include body rocking, hand flapping, spinning, rubbing a specific surface, and squealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need For Solitude &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-lies-medical-myths?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;There Is No Cure&amp;quot;: Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health &amp;quot;Lies&amp;quot; People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"There Is No Cure": Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health "Lies" People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jordan Siemens / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another common sign? “Needing solitude to recharge after social situations or really overstimulating situations — and overstimulating could be different for everyone — but that is a very typical hallmark of [autism],” Gardner-Wright said. This could mean feeling totally exhausted after a work presentation or a family party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal said this exhaustion comes from a term known as “camouflaging” or “masking.” “This is the idea that you have to really hide different facets of yourself or different behaviors in order to fit in what you think the expectations around you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while we all do this at times, the degree that autistic people have to camouflage aspects of themselves may result in a feeling of total drainage where afterward they report spending long periods of time alone or in dark and quiet places to recover, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tessers added that, from the outside, people have no idea when someone is camouflaging. “They’re doing what everybody wants or expects of them to some successful degree.” This could look like behaving as you “should” at work but going home and crashing and dreading the idea of having to do this camouflaging all over again tomorrow, Tessers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Intense Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Natalia Lebedinskaia / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A deep curiosity and passion for one particular activity or subject can also develop. “Our brains tend to gravitate with a lot of passion towards our area of interest and we become very invested in them and it’s also a way we self-soothe,” Neff said. This could mean building a career around a specific interest or knowing everything about a specific hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while everyone has interests — and many people have strong interests — Neff said autistic folks likely find a way to relate everything to their specific interest. For example, this could look like finding a way to talk about a favorite TV show even when the conversation revolves around current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Allistic people can have a special interest but then it doesn’t become their lens for their whole world,” Neff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dislike Of Small Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tom Werner / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-warning-signs-symptoms-shouldnt-ignore?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The &amp;quot;Small&amp;quot; Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The "Small" Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people don’t love small talk, but for people with autism, small talk can feel totally exhausting or something that shouldn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They typically don’t enjoy small talk and perhaps found ways to avoid it,” Neff said. “Maybe they structured their life or their career in a way that they don’t have to do a lot of that allistic communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that people who are on the spectrum tend to prefer deep, meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Direct Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Manu Vega / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with autism thrive on straightforwardness, with “really honest, clear communication being a strong preference,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neff said autistic people tend to be pretty literal. For example, when you say the phrase “it’s raining cats and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseamarshall/what-kind-of-dog-are-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;,” she said autistic people may picture literal cats and dogs falling from the sky in their mind, but then realize the person speaking is referring to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So, actually, I think it’s perhaps more precise to say we’re visual in our communication style versus literal, but it often shows up as being literal,” Neff said. Additionally, the communication style can be described as direct and honest. “What we say, we tend to say at face value,” Neff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have these signs, look to autistic voices for guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both Gardner-Wright and Neff recommend exploring the hashtag &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:#actuallyautistic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;#actuallyautistic&lt;/a&gt; on social media to listen to lived experiences and hear from people in your specific community about how this exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Discovering that you’re autistic as an adult can be really validating,” Gardner-Wright said. It can help you more fully understand yourself and your life. “But there can also be a grieving process for that,” she said, where you may wish you had this information when you were a kid so certain situations could have been different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Feeling a mix of grief and also excitement is very, very normal,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://embrace-autism.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:embrace-autism.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;embrace-autism.com&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource for free screening tools and tests to help you understand if you are autistic — though it is not diagnostic, they’re simply online guides to help arm you with information, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can reach out to mental health professionals, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Olga Pankova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neff said it can be helpful to connect with a therapist to talk about this new discovery, but she stressed that it’s important to find one who is neurodivergent-affirming or -informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal agreed and said “we have a long way to go with respect to training medical professionals and mental health professionals about autism. I worry there’s a lot of misinformation and misconceptions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal added that you can also look up autism centers near you for diagnosis or treatment, but noted that many have a yearslong waitlist and may focus only on children. If they can’t fit you in, Bal said, you can ask if they have resources they recommend, or look for community autism organizations to see if they have any resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, a community of supportive people can be helpful as well, which is where the #actuallyaustic hashtag — or other online communities — can be helpful.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-9-biggest-signs-of-autism-in-adulthood-goog_l_68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-bad-health-habits?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"They Had No Idea How Dangerous It Was."

Although it was evident that these waves varied with symptom severity, the methods used to interpret the buzz left a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix of patient diversity, combinations of symptoms, and a lack of unaffected controls made it difficult to compare the brain-wave activity of diseased states with a 'healthy' standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pooling multiple datasets and comparing differences in similar activity between more-or-less affected basal ganglia in each brain hemisphere, the researchers behind this latest study could 'listen in' on harmonies hidden within the brain's roar.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It's not just your body that needs to be 'worked out'. Your brain also needs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-made-a-video-game-that-boosts-short-term-memory-in-older-adults"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; to stay young and fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A digital brain exercise, developed by the American biotech company &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posit_Science_Corporation"&gt;Posit Science Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, has been put to the test by neurologists at McGill University in Canada, with some promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rigorous, double-blinded controlled trial, 82 healthy adults over the age of 65 were randomly assigned to play either Posit's 'BrainHQ' app or a recreational computer game for thirty minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 weeks, brain scans revealed that those who played BrainHQ, which focused on speed-based challenges, showed measurable increases in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"&gt;cholinergic&lt;/a&gt; activity, a type of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/part-of-your-brain-acts-like-a-pause-button-that-freezes-your-whole-body"&gt;brain signalling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was seen in a part of their brain known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt; (ACC) – which supports selective attention, inhibitory control, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-type-of-activity-is-particularly-effective-at-keeping-your-brain-young"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Type of Activity Is Particularly Effective at Keeping Your Brain Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in cholinergic signaling was comparable in magnitude to how much the ACC usually shrinks over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The training restored cholinergic health to levels typically seen in someone 10 years younger," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/researchers-neuro-show-brain-exercise-yields-benefits-368265"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Etienne de Villers-Sidani from McGill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time any intervention, drug or non-drug, has been shown to do that in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179584" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-642x402.png" alt="Brain-Training App " class="wp-image-179584 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-642x402.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-1077x675.png 1077w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-768x481.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-600x376.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179584" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In the Double Decision exercise in the BrainHQ app, participants identified images on a screen at increasing speed.

That said, it is rigorously designed and uses advanced brain scanning techniques in collaboration with McGill neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used a rare technology," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/researchers-neuro-show-brain-exercise-yields-benefits-368265"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; de Villers-Sidani.

            Children may be more likely to be diagnosed with autism and other neurodevelopment disorders if their mother had a Covid-19 infection while pregnant, according to a new &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/9900/neurodevelopmental_outcomes_of_3_year_old_children.1392.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300043b6nzxm4apar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed more than 18,000 births that occurred in the Mass General Brigham health system between March 2020 and May 2021, assessing records for laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 tests among the mothers and for neurodevelopment diagnoses among their children through age 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300053b6nl7sqz3df@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found that children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopment disorder than those born to mothers who did not have an infection while pregnant: more than 16% versus less than 10%, or a 1.3 times higher risk after adjusting for other risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300073b6n1rgwvjnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, differences in risks were more pronounced among boys and in cases where the mother had a Covid-19 infection during the third trimester. Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300063b6na3bx6p6z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300083b6nn0v0elm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/covid-19-during-pregnancy-linked-to-neurodevelopmental-disorders" target="_blank"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;.

            About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/autism-rate-cdc-report-2022"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes"&gt;caused the autism epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a news conference in September on the “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/finding-the-cause-of-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;cause of autism&lt;/a&gt;,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/health/trump-autism-announcement-cause-tylenol"&gt;Tylenol during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.

            The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”

The owner of Reichardt Duck Farm, which sits in the rolling hills between Petaluma and the Two Rock area, confirmed that his facility recently recorded positive cases of the dreaded virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;added to its public database&lt;/a&gt; a second incidence of the highly virulent avian flu in Sonoma County, this one at an egg farm. The Press Democrat was unable to immediately confirm the location of that outbreak, which resulted in the deaths of 231,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing is a wake-up call. Two winters ago, when Sonoma County poultry farms were &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/01/12/sonoma-county-poultry-farmers-euthanize-thousands-more-birds-as-avian-flu-losses-devastate-local-industry/"&gt;ravaged by the spread of avian influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the first case didn’t hit until around Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreak is another blow to the Reichardt family. Their Middle Two Rock Road farm was also heavily affected in 2023-24, when it was &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/12/01/250000-birds-to-be-killed-at-2-petaluma-poultry-farms-after-avian-flu-detected-2/"&gt;the first of multiple local facilities &lt;/a&gt;infected by the deadly and highly virulent avian flu virus, which typically requires producers to destroy all of their birds on site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-8p60lgsb" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_8p60lgsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird flu outbreaks hit flocks at nine other chicken, duck and egg-laying facilities in the county that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Reichardt paused to talk to a reporter &lt;span&gt;Tuesday &lt;/span&gt;as his farm staff went about euthanizing 57,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at the last six years now, with &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/12/03/activism-prospective-ballot-fight-heighten-drama-of-sonoma-county-bird-flu-outbreak/"&gt;the DxE (animal liberation) raid&lt;/a&gt;, COVID, bird flu in ’23, now bird flu again in ’25. My older sister passed in 2020,” he said. “It’s been hit after hit. We’re looking for our fate to change at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reichardt Duck Farm is not to be confused with Liberty Ducks, a smaller Sonoma County&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;producer, owned by members of the same family but operating at a separate location.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreak was detected after Reichardt Duck Farm staff noticed “a modest increase in mortality” — eight dead birds — in one of the barns last week, Phil Reichardt said. The next morning, there were a few more than that. They took a sample of birds to UC Davis for analysis, and received confirmation of Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu, or HPAI, on Oct. 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duck farm began “depopulating” its flock Sunday, borrowing some machinery from Weber Family Farms, an egg facility that also was forced to put birds to death in 2023-24. Phil Reichardt expected to finish the grim task Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a departure from two years ago, when local ranchers knew much less about the spread of the pathogen and how best to block it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that previous round, Reichardt said, the farm received instructions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture the day before Thanksgiving. Because of the holiday, and a lower sense of urgency, they didn’t begin depopulating for six days. This time, Reichardt expected to be done five days after confirmation, which he hoped would reduce the chances of the flu hopping to another facility.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“The industry, unfortunately, is getting very good at this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report Thursday of another outbreak in one of the region’s bird farms demonstrates the limitations of that quick action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo Gallardo, professor of poultry medicine at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and an expert in poultry RNA viruses, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely a concerted effort,” Gallardo said. “The California Department of Food and Agriculture usually helps with this, the USDA usually helps. We’re all at high alert. We’re approaching winter. And we have learned a lot of things about biosecurity and prevention. The hope is that we will reduce dissemination after one detection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations on biosecurity measures haven’t changed based on the new appearance of HPAI, said Sue Ostrom, Sonoma County’s assistant agricultural commissioner, because — as Reichardt alluded — producers have gotten the work pretty buttoned down since their unprecedented local losses in the winter season two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that led to,” Ostrom said, “is that producers understand what needs to happen. How we dispose of carcasses, bedding and so forth. They can get to that faster now.”&lt;/p&gt;

The farm had to destroy 550,000 chickens and 3.2 million eggs after an avian flu outbreak. (Christopher Chung / The Press Democrat)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="icon-enlarge mng-gallery-fullscreen-expand" aria-label="Expand fullscreen slideshow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strain of bird flu detected in recent tests at Reichardt Duck Farm is the same as the one that swept Sonoma County two years ago, resulting in the &lt;span&gt;destruction of 1.2 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any real smoking gun,” Reichardt said. “We can only expect it was migratory birds flying overhead. We step into their droppings and enter the barns. We have foot pans in place, and we are careful to use them. But I guess we can’t hit everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like viruses transmitted among humans, HPAI tends to peak during the cold winter months. It generally spreads from migrating waterfowl to domesticated flocks along the major north-south flyways, including the Pacific Flyway that travels above Sonoma County. Researchers estimate 1 billion birds fly south along the Pacific Flyway each fall, and north again in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s normal, in a certain sense, to think cases will go up in the winter,” Gallardo said. “Usually, respiratory infections in chickens are related to changes in temperature and humidity. With birds migrating south, we’re right at a time when this might happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Reichardt Duck Farm was obligated to put down all of its birds, the business is not without prospects. Phil Reichardt estimated they have about 15,000 eggs currently incubating, and another 20,000-30,000 that are eligible to take that step soon. Those eggs must be moved off the property to raise elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an expensive process when no revenue is coming in,” Reichardt said. “But it’s all we know how to do. So we keep going even when it feels like we’re battering our heads against a brick wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/01/21/why-local-poultry-farmers-say-10-million-bird-flu-reimbursement-falls-short-2/"&gt;has an indemnity program&lt;/a&gt; that compensates poultry farmers for income lost to avian flu. In the 2023-24 outbreaks, affected Sonoma County farms received a total of $10.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reichardt said he’s appreciative of “anything that helps keep us afloat,” but noted that he and the department are far apart in their estimation of fair market value for the ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also is hoping to open a discussion on USDA depopulation requirements. Because the flu is so highly transmissible, the federal agency insists on complete depopulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Could we have euthanized the affected birds and monitored the others? And continue testing birds?” Reichardt wondered, noting that only a couple dozen were confirmed sick in the recent outbreak. “I think I understand USDA’s stance. This thing is terrible. When it takes hold, it’s like a wildfire. But I think there are other methods to put out the wildfire. It’s a depressing process to put down healthy, happy birds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duck farm must now wait four months before reintroducing birds, and it will takes months beyond that for young ducks to mature and become egg layers. Reichardt Duck Farm had yet to fully bounce back from late 2023, when the company was forced to euthanize more than 200,000 birds. The owner estimates that before getting the bad news last week, they were at about 40% of their pre-2023 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most depressing for Phil Reichardt is knowing there’s a good chance the staff members who have been handling the depopulation may soon find their hours slashed, or could even be laid off as some were two winters ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really gets me emotional. Some of them are family to us,” Reichardt said. “These people are working their butts off to put themselves out of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big California outbreak of 2023-24 was also in late October, at a turkey meat facility in Merced County. By the end of that winter, at least 6.3 million commercial birds had been killed in the state. In Sonoma County alone, officials estimated the financial loss to producers at around $22 million. The effects were felt well beyond farm properties, with &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/01/15/aftermath-of-bird-flu-lowers-supply-and-ups-cost-of-eggs-2/"&gt;egg prices skyrocketing in stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last winter was far more devastating statewide, with more than 16.5 million dead birds. But that pandemic left Sonoma County unscathed. This winter already threatens to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

This behavior appears to be a strategy to satisfy two distinct psychological needs: signaling social status and projecting a sense of personal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is often understood as a personality trait characterized by a grandiose sense of self, a persistent need for admiration, and a focus on one’s own importance. While this may project an image of supreme confidence, psychological research has shown that narcissism can exist alongside deep-seated feelings of insecurity, such as low self-esteem or a sense that one is not living as their “true self.” It is this particular combination of traits that interested the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, cultural taste was seen through the lens of social class. Sociologists argued that elites used their preference for “highbrow” culture, like classical music and fine art, to distinguish themselves from other social classes. In recent decades, however, this pattern has shifted. Observers have noted the rise of the “cultural omnivore,” an individual who appreciates both high-status cultural products and more popular, “lowbrow” forms like pop music or street art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors proposed that this modern trend might be explained not just by social class, but by specific personality dynamics. They hypothesized that people high in narcissism but low in self-security might use cultural consumption as a tool. Liking highbrow culture could serve their need to signal superior status, while an appreciation for lowbrow culture, often seen as more authentic, could help soothe their inner feelings of inauthenticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this idea, the researchers conducted two separate studies. In the first experiment, they surveyed 178 university students. Participants completed questionnaires designed to measure their levels of narcissism and self-esteem. They were then asked to rate how likely they would be to participate in a variety of cultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these activities were classified as highbrow, including attending a classical symphony or visiting art galleries. Others were categorized as lowbrow, such as going to pop concerts or viewing graffiti and street art. The researchers analyzed the data to see if there was a connection between the participants’ personality scores and their cultural intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed a distinct pattern. For individuals who scored high on the narcissism scale, having lower self-esteem was associated with a stronger intention to participate in highbrow cultural activities. A similar relationship appeared for lowbrow culture. The participants with high narcissism and low self-esteem also expressed a greater interest in lowbrow activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirmed that the insecure narcissist profile was linked to being a cultural omnivore, showing an appetite for both ends of the cultural spectrum. The analysis also suggested that this behavior was connected to a general motivation for “distinction seeking,” or a desire to establish a unique and notable identity through their choices. This relationship held even when the researchers accounted for other factors, like a person’s openness to new experiences or their own perception of their social status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study was designed to explore the specific motivations behind these dual preferences. The researchers wanted to confirm if status seeking was driving the interest in highbrow culture, while a need for integrity was behind the preference for lowbrow culture. This experiment involved 144 university students and used a slightly different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of measuring general self-esteem, the researchers measured a more specific form of insecurity known as self-alienation, which is the feeling of being out of touch with one’s true self. They also focused on a particular aspect of narcissism related to superiority and arrogance. Participants were then randomly assigned to read a biography of a fictional artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One version of the biography presented the artist as highbrow, noting that her paintings were exhibited in major museums around the world. The other version framed her as lowbrow, explaining that her work was given to family and friends before being discovered by an art dealer in her hometown. After reading one of the biographies, participants rated their interest in seeing the artist’s work. They also answered questions about their current motivations, including their desire to signal status and their need to project self-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this experiment provided clearer support for the researchers’ hypothesis. Among participants who read about the highbrow artist, those with the insecure narcissist profile showed greater interest in her work. This increased interest was statistically linked to a heightened desire for status at that moment. Consuming high-status art appeared to satisfy their need to be seen as having high status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the participants who read about the lowbrow artist, a different motivation was at play. In this case, the insecure narcissist group’s interest in the art was connected to their desire to signal self-integrity. The perceived authenticity of the lowbrow artist seemed to offer a way for these individuals to bolster their own shaky sense of self. The two studies together paint a nuanced picture of how personality can shape cultural tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research provides a new psychological perspective on a phenomenon that has largely been studied through a sociological framework. It suggests that for some people, the choice of what art to consume is not merely a matter of taste but a complex strategy for managing their identity and internal insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that their findings are based on statistical associations, and future research could explore these mechanisms further. For instance, an experiment could temporarily change a person’s feelings of security to see if it directly affects their cultural preferences. Researchers could also examine whether this pattern of behavior extends to other domains, such as luxury consumption, social media use, or even charitable giving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/aca0000303" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;How Insecure Narcissists Become Cultural Omnivores: Consuming Highbrow Culture for Status Seeking and Lowbrow Culture for Integrity Signaling&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hanna Shin and Nara Youn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 22:03:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxON2c5TFNxeEx6Z2M3d0xpekt3RUozU1l1X05xQmdvaE9GRXNOMERPZXVmVUFjUjJfYVBLd0Y1a3JNVlg1bzBCTHAwbHpxeVhXcURDbU0xSU0zS3NpS1VYbmZkTHp0VjRnSEJnYmtnb29zeEU1bHZXTlAxOFpSQ0ttOXdWc095S1lzWk1SV0V6R0hhUU1CNzI0</guid></item><item><title>专家揭示了超加工食品对身体的100种影响...以及如何扭转它们-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15243725/effects-ultra-processed-foods-junk-exercise-gut-hormones.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is no secret that high-fat, high-sugar ultra-processed foods make a person sluggish and depressed. It is also not a surprise that a sedentary lifestyle compounds those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent study, University College Cork researchers discovered that a two-month &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13135781/processed-foods-cigarettes-expert-cancer-heart-lung-disease.html"&gt;junk food diet&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;span&gt;that mirrored &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;an ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; food (UPF) diet typical in the US, &lt;/span&gt;drastically altered the gut environment of rats, changing 100 out of 175 measured bacterial compounds and depleting specific metabolites that affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain and gut are closely connected via what scientists call the gut-brain axis, a complex and constant 'conversation' between the digestive system and brain, where gut bacteria produce compounds that directly influence mood, stress levels and cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the latest study, exercise combatted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-bdb7db90-b5d5-11f0-be90-313e077171fe"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; caused by a diet mirroring the one that Americans often adhere to, by rebalancing crucial metabolic hormones and restoring beneficial gut compounds.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity also reduced anxiety- and depression-like behavior and enhanced learning and memory in the rats who ate the junk food diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, it has been unclear whether exercise can reverse the unhealthy diet’s effects on mood, as well as cognitive behaviors, but this latest study suggests that it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that a primary way exercise combats depression is by repairing the gut microbiome, which is damaged by a poor diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The restored gut bacteria then release beneficial substances that travel from the gut to the brain, acting as crucial chemical signals to improve mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While exercise is known to improve mood and cognition, it has been unclear whether it can counteract the negative effects of an unhealthy diet on these same behaviors (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) dominate the American diet, accounting for roughly 70 percent of grocery items. The industrially engineered products contain artificial flavors and additives rarely found in home kitchens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their hyper-palatable, salty, and sweet design makes them hard to resist, with emerging research suggesting they may be addictive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans get about 55 percent of their daily calories from cheap, tasty and unhealthy manufactured foods. Diets made up mainly of these offenders are strongly linked to an increased risk of heart disease, heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is a consistent and growing body of evidence linking a diet high in UPFs to an increased risk of overall cancer and specific cancer types such as colorectal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 analysis found that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10285062/"&gt;every 10 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in the proportion of UPFs in the diet was associated with a four percent higher risk of colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets heavy in UPFs have also been associated with markedly higher rates of depression. In August, Turkish researchers reported that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12393073/"&gt;a 10 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in UPF consumption per daily calorie intake increased the depression risk by 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure depression in rats, the Irish team conducted a swim test in which they measured the amount of time a rat spent immobile, floating passively and making only the minimal movements necessary to keep its head above water, an indication of despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers divided the rats into four distinct groups: one ate a healthy diet without access to a running wheel for exercise, a second ate an unhealthy 'cafeteria diet' without exercise, a third ate a healthy diet with voluntary running wheel access, and the fourth ate the unhealthy diet with exercise access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rats on the unhealthy diet spent significantly more time floating passively compared to the healthy diet group. However, when the rats with unhealthy diets had access to a running wheel between meals and then were put in the pool, this inactivity was reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Sedentary rats on a junk food diet ((CAF-SED) gave up swimming faster, a sign of depression. But when they exercised (CAF-EX), they kept swimming, showing that exercise reversed the diet's adverse effect on mood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They spent less time floating and more time actively swimming, just like the healthy rats. Rats were less likely to give up, which researchers interpret as indicating they were less depressed in the context of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While exercise had a minimal effect on the gut microbiomes of rats eating healthy food, it had a powerful restorative effect on the rats eating junk food, reversing dozens of the harmful changes caused by the poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unhealthy diet depleted three key gut compounds: anserine, a brain-protecting antioxidant; deoxyinosine, a building block for stable mood; and indole-3-carboxylate, which aids in the production of serotonin. The loss of these beneficial molecules disrupted crucial communication between the gut and the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise restored these compounds. Since these molecules are known to influence mood and brain function, this appears to be a primary way exercise combats diet-induced depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unhealthy diet spiked insulin and leptin levels, hormones that, when chronically elevated, are linked to depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the rats on the unhealthy diet exercised, researchers observed that insulin did not spike after eating, leptin levels were reduced and the body increased production of beneficial hormones that were reduced by the poor diet, such as GLP-1, which helps regulate blood sugar and promotes feelings of fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise effectively normalized these hormones, improving metabolic health and directly contributing to a better mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to performing a forced swim test after eight weeks, they also performed tests for anxiety and spatial memory. Rats were placed in a large pool of opaque water. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A hidden platform was submerged just below the surface, invisible to the rats. The rats had to learn and remember the location of the platform based on visual cues placed around the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the four training days, all groups of rats learned to find the hidden platform at a similar rate. The unhealthy diet did not severely impair their ability to learn the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most telling result came from analyzing how the rats searched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that sedentary rats on an unhealthy diet tended to use less efficient, more random swimming patterns, such as circling, while exercised rats on the same diet used more direct and purposeful search paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study’s results must be interpreted cautiously, as human studies are still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study’s lead author, Yvonne Nolan, professor in anatomy and neuroscience at University College Cork, said: ‘We studied young adult male rats only. While animal models provide valuable mechanistic insights, we cannot assume identical effects in humans, females, or different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our rats exercised voluntarily with continuous wheel access, which differs from structured human exercise programs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025a.0116/article-10.61373-bm025a.0116.xml#d96192e456"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You’re mid-sentence when you realize you totally forgot what you’re saying, or you’re driving to work—on a route you’ve traveled 100 times—but you take a wrong turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that occasional forgetfulness, wrong turns, mind farts—whatever you want to call them—are a part of life, but that doesn’t make them any less unsettling, especially as you, or someone you love, gets older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65667352/dementia-misdiagnosed-normal-aging-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; affects more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. cases are expected to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:double by 2060;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;double by 2060&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s worth knowing when to take a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a67950962/excessive-sleepiness-dementia-symptom-new/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; seriously. When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68148089/how-to-improve-brain-health-doctor-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, knowing and understanding the signs of a potential problem can be a huge asset because acting at the earliest signs of cognitive changes can make a big difference. And, even if you’re not experiencing any decline, you can act now to reduce your risk. Up to 45 percent of dementia risk is modifiable, according to research in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Anyone with a brain should be looking out for their brain health, from kids to elders,” says Georgina Aldridge, MD, a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of being proactive involves knowing which signs and symptoms to take seriously. The main symptom people associate with declining brain health is forgetfulness, especially during older age, but it’s far from the only indication that something could be off. Many common symptoms fall into one of the following categories, per Dr. Aldridge: short-term memory, language, visual-spatial, executive (thinking, planning, solving problems), and behavioral. That said, everyone is different, and a person may experience any combination of symptoms depending on their condition and stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, doctors share the specific symptoms they wouldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/providers/georgina-m-aldridge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Georgina Aldridge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgina Aldridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care. &lt;a href="https://www.sutterhealth.org/research/investigators/armen-moughamian-1049681097" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Armen Moughamian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Armen Moughamian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC). &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1720493141/shae-datta" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shae Datta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shae Datta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Symptoms Brain Doctors Wouldn’t Ignore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Forgetfulness and short-term memory problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most widely-known signs of declining &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; are forgetfulness and/or having issues with short-term memory (your brain’s ability to hold limited information for a few seconds to hours). But it’s important to state upfront that memory issues in middle-aged adults could be due to any number of causes unrelated to dementia, Dr. Aldridge says, which is all the more reason to start a conversation with your doctor. “The person may have undiagnosed &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means they aren’t getting the good sleep that is necessary to form memories,” she says. “The person could also have a deficiency in a vitamin, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077099/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as B12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that is necessary for the cells and nerves to function correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General forgetfulness can start in a person’s mid-50s or 60s, but it’s particularly important to look out for progressive changes in adults over 65 since the risk of a neurodegenerative brain disease like Alzheimer’s rises significantly with age, says Armen Moughamian, MD, the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgetting recent conversations or events can be a warning sign of mild cognitive impairment that may progress to dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease, says Dr. Moughamian. Sometimes this symptom is subtle: “Families might think their loved one just ‘wasn’t listening’ or ‘isn’t paying attention,’” Dr. Moughamian says. One way to tell if there may be something more serious going on is to take note of the consistency and frequency of these episodes. If it’s happening repeatedly, it’s worth having a conversation with a doctor, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Irregular sleep patterns or poor sleep quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it wasn’t clear already, practicing good &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68129140/how-to-get-good-deep-restorative-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the key to better health all-around, and that includes your brain. (In fact, lack of sleep in middle age may increase dementia risk, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice that you haven’t been resting well lately, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s due to a brain disorder, but it’s worth getting to the bottom of. Feeling sleepy and excessive napping during the day &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; serve as an early marker of dementia, particularly for women in their 80s, per a 2025 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106755/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not concerned about dementia or Alzheimer’s, sleep influences brain health and vice versa, so to help your body function optimally, try to get your Zzzs in. “I often remind patients that sleep is one of the most effective ways to protect the brain,” says Shae Datta, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone. “Sleep is when the brain &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/neurons-help-flush-waste-out-of-brain-during-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clears waste products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clears waste products&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and consolidates memories. When sleep quality declines, it can affect cognitive performance and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68915281/sleep-brain-aging-link/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-term brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember: Everyone’s sleep needs are different, but the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) recommends that most adults get between seven to nine hours per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mood, personality, or behavior changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in mood, personality, and behavior can all be signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s. Behavior change is broad, but it can often look like someone feeling suspicious of or threatened by others for little or no reason, showing unusual sexual behavior, becoming physically violent (like hitting someone else), and more, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-changes-behavior-and-communication/alzheimers-caregiving-managing-personality-and" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It can also look like a social faux pas like talking excessively to strangers, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“New-onset anxiety, depression, or irritability in your 60s can be an early and often overlooked sign of Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Moughamian says. “These mood changes frequently appear before any memory problems, signaling that something deeper may be happening in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, personality changes can suggest a specific condition called &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65090545/mom-dementia-diagnosis-marathons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frontotemporal dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FTD), Dr. Aldridge adds. FTD is one of the most common types of dementia that affect younger and middle-aged adults. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 40 and 65, but it can strike younger and older adults as well, and it affects women and men equally, per &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dementia/frontotemporal-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Struggling with language or trouble finding the right words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had the feeling that a word is “right on the tip of your tongue?” We’ve all been there, but experiencing new or worsening issues with language (past the occasional slip-up) can signal potential problems in the brain, Dr. Datta says. In cases of Alzheimer’s and dementia, this can look like having difficulty understanding complex sentences, dropping connecting words, struggling to name a familiar object, and more, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble finding everyday words mid-sentence or frequently “hitting a wall” in conversation is also potentially concerning and may point to early Alzheimer’s or another neurological condition, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Difficulty with everyday household skills and tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s that people experience have to do with the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/executive-function" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:executive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive function&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; side of brain health, Dr. Aldridge says—basically, how you manage everyday tasks like making plans, solving problems, and making decisions. If you consistently have trouble with any of those things and didn’t necessarily struggle with them before, it could be a sign of dementia, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone stops cooking, stops managing medications, or misses paying bills, this is concerning,” he says. “People typically don’t just stop doing things, and often these changes are changes that are associated with dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Changes in visual-spatial awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with emerging brain health issues might encounter trouble with visual-spatial awareness, which is your brain’s ability to understand what you see and interpret the relationship between objects in space. Conditions like dementia can &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-215435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:affect your vision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;affect your vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so if you have trouble with something like depth perception—signing too high up on a check or not being able to find objects among clutter— it could be an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/2/157" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early sign of Alzheimer’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early sign of Alzheimer’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or certain types of dementia, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person starts experiencing visual hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there), it could be a sign of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), a complex disorder involving abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These deposits, called “Lewy bodies,” affect chemicals in the brain, which can lead to changes in thinking and behavior. As a result, a person might experience visual hallucinations that are vivid and even scary in nature. (If the hallucinations are severe, doctors can prescribe medication, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re experiencing hallucinations, you should definitely see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you love are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it may be a good time to see a doctor. Although some cognitive changes come naturally with age, things could progress from mild cognitive impairment to something more serious—so, better to be proactive and see a neurologist who can help you navigate what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:55:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQZ0hHMDhXTXMxMHk0b0R0dmlfQ0FGbHFQRUhMcXYzaVcwXzRqeHBiTkdTZlFtNTN3b2ZmTjAxbmlGWjR3NTFaSlhnN1RSaVVHd3RES1NFQW42OTZMTFdsWXB2bVIxZHhZYmxYQjFITVZQcFd1ZVllYTdQMng3Rnp4SWh2eEpMdDAydkE</guid></item><item><title>由皮特研究员共同创造的眼睛植入物帮助近视盲人再次看到- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/news/health-now/eye-implant-designed-by-pitt-researcher-helps-the-near-blind-see-again/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retinal implant the size of a strawberry seed co-created by a University of Pittsburgh researcher has helped partially restore vision for older people suffering from macular degeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in Europe and co-led by Dr. José-Alain Sahel, chair of Pitt’s ophthalmology department and director of the UPMC Vision Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396?logout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed significant vision improvement after a year for 26 of 32 people who had the tiny device surgically implanted.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants were older than 60 and considered legally blind because of the disease, which affects part of the retina and erodes central vision, or people’s ability to clearly see things in front of them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant mimics the light-sensitive cells destroyed by macular degeneration. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahel described the device, which measures just 2 millimeters each way, as a “miniaturized solar panel.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be paired with specialized glasses. A small camera mounted on the frame captures images and sends them to a cell phone-sized processor in the user’s pocket. The information goes back up to the camera and is projected onto the implant.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, the brain’s normal vision processes take over and, in many cases, patients who are nearly blind regain some of their vision.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the implant, participants couldn’t see the first or second line of a vision chart. A year in, patients saw an average improvement of five lines, with one being able to see 12 more lines than before.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can read letters, they can read words and some of them can read a book, which is something we didn’t even really think could happen,” Sahel said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one patient reported being able to navigate the subway again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Disease afflicts millions&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is called PRIMA, and has been in development for 20 years. Along with Sahel, Stanford University professor and study co-author Daniel Palanker has been a driving force behind this research.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two past pilot studies showed promise, but “this is the first study of this size and this level of improvement that has ever been achieved in this field,” Sahel said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced macular degeneration affects more than 5 million people worldwide, according to the researchers. For those older than 80, it’s the leading cause of irreversible blindness.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease progressively blurs, darkens and distorts the center of the field of vision, while leaving peripheral vision intact.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late stages of macular degeneration, central vision goes completely dark. Existing treatments can only slow the disease’s advance.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients tend to just see zaps of light after surgery, Sahel explained, but through a training program, the brain learns to better process the implant’s signals. This usually takes a few weeks.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at its best, the bionic vision is limited. It appears in black and white and can be somewhat blurry.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahel and other researchers are working on a next-generation device with higher resolution.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIMA has the potential to restore vision in patients with other diseases, as long as they have a functional optical nerve. It cannot compensate for eye trauma, for instance.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Working with regulators&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device manufacturer, Science Corp., is working to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe for use beyond clinical trials.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science hopes to make PRIMA available in Europe by the end of 2026, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth McKenzie.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not give a target date in the U.S., but said the company is engaged in an approval process with the federal Food and Drug Administration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will likely look at some of the negative effects reported in the study, mostly related to the surgery, rather than the device itself.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure is done in most cases under general anesthesia, as opposed to just numbing the eye. To insert the chip, surgeons make a small incision into the retina — the back part of the eye used to detect light — and place the chip underneath it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent side effects were pressure in the eyes, bleeding and small rips at the edges of the retina.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None were life-threatening, and nearly all resolved quickly.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies already proved to Sahel the device was safe and effective. After these latest results, widespread use of PRIMA appears closer than ever.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal was to show this is scalable,” he said.

You’re mid-sentence when you realize you totally forgot what you’re saying, or you’re driving to work—on a route you’ve traveled 100 times—but you take a wrong turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The truth is that occasional forgetfulness, wrong turns, mind farts—whatever you want to call them—are a part of life, but that doesn’t make them any less unsettling, especially as you, or someone you love, gets older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65667352/dementia-misdiagnosed-normal-aging-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; affects more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. cases are expected to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:double by 2060;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;double by 2060&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s worth knowing when to take a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a67950962/excessive-sleepiness-dementia-symptom-new/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; seriously. When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68148089/how-to-improve-brain-health-doctor-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, knowing and understanding the signs of a potential problem can be a huge asset because acting at the earliest signs of cognitive changes can make a big difference. And, even if you’re not experiencing any decline, you can act now to reduce your risk. Up to 45 percent of dementia risk is modifiable, according to research in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Anyone with a brain should be looking out for their brain health, from kids to elders,” says Georgina Aldridge, MD, a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of being proactive involves knowing which signs and symptoms to take seriously. The main symptom people associate with declining brain health is forgetfulness, especially during older age, but it’s far from the only indication that something could be off. Many common symptoms fall into one of the following categories, per Dr. Aldridge: short-term memory, language, visual-spatial, executive (thinking, planning, solving problems), and behavioral. That said, everyone is different, and a person may experience any combination of symptoms depending on their condition and stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ahead, doctors share the specific symptoms they wouldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/providers/georgina-m-aldridge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Georgina Aldridge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgina Aldridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care. &lt;a href="https://www.sutterhealth.org/research/investigators/armen-moughamian-1049681097" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Armen Moughamian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Armen Moughamian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC). &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1720493141/shae-datta" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shae Datta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shae Datta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Symptoms Brain Doctors Wouldn’t Ignore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Forgetfulness and short-term memory problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most widely-known signs of declining &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; are forgetfulness and/or having issues with short-term memory (your brain’s ability to hold limited information for a few seconds to hours). But it’s important to state upfront that memory issues in middle-aged adults could be due to any number of causes unrelated to dementia, Dr. Aldridge says, which is all the more reason to start a conversation with your doctor. “The person may have undiagnosed &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means they aren’t getting the good sleep that is necessary to form memories,” she says. “The person could also have a deficiency in a vitamin, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077099/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as B12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that is necessary for the cells and nerves to function correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;General forgetfulness can start in a person’s mid-50s or 60s, but it’s particularly important to look out for progressive changes in adults over 65 since the risk of a neurodegenerative brain disease like Alzheimer’s rises significantly with age, says Armen Moughamian, MD, the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Forgetting recent conversations or events can be a warning sign of mild cognitive impairment that may progress to dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease, says Dr. Moughamian. Sometimes this symptom is subtle: “Families might think their loved one just ‘wasn’t listening’ or ‘isn’t paying attention,’” Dr. Moughamian says. One way to tell if there may be something more serious going on is to take note of the consistency and frequency of these episodes. If it’s happening repeatedly, it’s worth having a conversation with a doctor, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Irregular sleep patterns or poor sleep quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If it wasn’t clear already, practicing good &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68129140/how-to-get-good-deep-restorative-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the key to better health all-around, and that includes your brain. (In fact, lack of sleep in middle age may increase dementia risk, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice that you haven’t been resting well lately, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s due to a brain disorder, but it’s worth getting to the bottom of. Feeling sleepy and excessive napping during the day &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; serve as an early marker of dementia, particularly for women in their 80s, per a 2025 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106755/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you’re not concerned about dementia or Alzheimer’s, sleep influences brain health and vice versa, so to help your body function optimally, try to get your Zzzs in. “I often remind patients that sleep is one of the most effective ways to protect the brain,” says Shae Datta, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone. “Sleep is when the brain &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/neurons-help-flush-waste-out-of-brain-during-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clears waste products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;clears waste products&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and consolidates memories. When sleep quality declines, it can affect cognitive performance and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68915281/sleep-brain-aging-link/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-term brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just remember: Everyone’s sleep needs are different, but the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) recommends that most adults get between seven to nine hours per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mood, personality, or behavior changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in mood, personality, and behavior can all be signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s. Behavior change is broad, but it can often look like someone feeling suspicious of or threatened by others for little or no reason, showing unusual sexual behavior, becoming physically violent (like hitting someone else), and more, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-changes-behavior-and-communication/alzheimers-caregiving-managing-personality-and" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It can also look like a social faux pas like talking excessively to strangers, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“New-onset anxiety, depression, or irritability in your 60s can be an early and often overlooked sign of Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Moughamian says. “These mood changes frequently appear before any memory problems, signaling that something deeper may be happening in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sometimes, personality changes can suggest a specific condition called &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65090545/mom-dementia-diagnosis-marathons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frontotemporal dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FTD), Dr. Aldridge adds. FTD is one of the most common types of dementia that affect younger and middle-aged adults. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 40 and 65, but it can strike younger and older adults as well, and it affects women and men equally, per &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dementia/frontotemporal-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Struggling with language or trouble finding the right words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Have you ever had the feeling that a word is “right on the tip of your tongue?” We’ve all been there, but experiencing new or worsening issues with language (past the occasional slip-up) can signal potential problems in the brain, Dr. Datta says. In cases of Alzheimer’s and dementia, this can look like having difficulty understanding complex sentences, dropping connecting words, struggling to name a familiar object, and more, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trouble finding everyday words mid-sentence or frequently “hitting a wall” in conversation is also potentially concerning and may point to early Alzheimer’s or another neurological condition, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Difficulty with everyday household skills and tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the most common symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s that people experience have to do with the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/executive-function" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:executive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive function&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; side of brain health, Dr. Aldridge says—basically, how you manage everyday tasks like making plans, solving problems, and making decisions. If you consistently have trouble with any of those things and didn’t necessarily struggle with them before, it could be a sign of dementia, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If someone stops cooking, stops managing medications, or misses paying bills, this is concerning,” he says. “People typically don’t just stop doing things, and often these changes are changes that are associated with dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Changes in visual-spatial awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with emerging brain health issues might encounter trouble with visual-spatial awareness, which is your brain’s ability to understand what you see and interpret the relationship between objects in space. Conditions like dementia can &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-215435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:affect your vision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;affect your vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so if you have trouble with something like depth perception—signing too high up on a check or not being able to find objects among clutter— it could be an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/2/157" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early sign of Alzheimer’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;early sign of Alzheimer’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or certain types of dementia, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If a person starts experiencing visual hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there), it could be a sign of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), a complex disorder involving abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These deposits, called “Lewy bodies,” affect chemicals in the brain, which can lead to changes in thinking and behavior. As a result, a person might experience visual hallucinations that are vivid and even scary in nature. (If the hallucinations are severe, doctors can prescribe medication, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re experiencing hallucinations, you should definitely see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you or someone you love are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it may be a good time to see a doctor. Although some cognitive changes come naturally with age, things could progress from mild cognitive impairment to something more serious—so, better to be proactive and see a neurologist who can help you navigate what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 19:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQdzg1OGp1ZHdvVzM5VDJHLVhfTEJVOTF6VkNwQ1FhR3JBUXNSUVdYLUFIekM0b29maVlMbks2Y2lDczFDNi1qanc4c2Z0Qm9UZ0tUVThXM1JSUzNaZ2d6c3FSTWgwQm02WDZ6endGaGdPWnVBd1lyWUl2ekZLMENiemVlS0xfT2tnVHRJcVdBOW9BbXM</guid></item><item><title>综述：人类H5N1禽流感病例可能无症状，病毒可能在人群中传播- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/review-human-h5n1-avian-flu-cases-can-be-asymptomatic-and-virus-likely</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asymptomatic human avian influenza A(H5N1) infections occur, and person-to-person transmission is likely in some settings, reveals a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840680"&gt;&lt;span&gt;scoping review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, published yesterday in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, involved a search for studies on confirmed highly pathogenic H5N1 infection published through August 25, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Since 1997, more than 1,000 infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus among humans have been reported globally," the researchers wrote. "Given ongoing A(H5N1) outbreaks in animals, understanding the frequency of A(H5N1) virus infections among asymptomatic persons can inform public health risk assessments and infection prevention guidance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 symptom-less human infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team identified 10 reports of 18 asymptomatic human H5N1 infection, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robust data collection is needed from persons with possible asymptomatic A(H5N1) virus infection to inform future public health responses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two MSC cases occurred in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam who were identified through investigations of household contacts of index H5N1 patients; one patient was also exposed to infected chickens, and the other is believed to have been infected through human-to-human spread, because they had no contact with sick or dead poultry.  Neither MSC patient had used personal protective equipment when in close contact with an infected household member or chickens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 16 MC patients (14 adults and 2 children), 11 were identified through enhanced surveillance of people exposed to poultry infected with H5N1 (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, and 1 in the United Kingdom), and the remaining 5 patients (3 in Vietnam and 2 in Cambodia) were identified through contact tracing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Asymptomatic human infections with A(H5N1) virus have been infrequently reported, with most cases identified through enhanced surveillance or household contact investigations of persons with known exposure," the authors noted. "Robust data collection is needed from persons with possible asymptomatic A(H5N1) virus infection to inform future public health responses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaps in surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840687"&gt;&lt;span&gt;commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the same journal, Rick Bright, PhD, of Bright Global Health, and Nicole Lurie, MD, MSPH, of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Harvard Medical School, noted that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with confirmed infections in more than 800 herds in at least 16 states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Human cases have been confirmed in multiple states, and as of mid-2025, approximately 70 cases have been officially reported, most with mild illness but including at least 1 death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;High viral levels have been found in raw milk, and live virus has been detected in mammary tissue and milking equipment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Spillover into, and transmission among, other mammals has been documented, including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine," they wrote. "Human cases have been confirmed in multiple states, and as of mid-2025, approximately 70 cases have been officially reported, most with mild illness but including at least 1 death." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bright and Lurie said the findings challenge the traditional perception that human H5N1 infections are almost always symptomatic and severe and that no human-to-human H5N1 spread has occurred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It also highlights a critical gap in many national and global surveillance systems, which tend to focus on the detection of symptomatic illness rather than infection, and underscores the importance of carefully examining clusters where limited transmission may occur," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel E. Lieberman calls the rigid “8 hours” rule Industrial Era “nonsense,” noting that people without modern electricity typically sleep six to seven hours without napping, and large cohorts show the lowest mortality risk around seven hours, not eight. Lieberman expanded on the research for his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exercised/dp/0141986360/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1N2T1NB5HRXT0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.r2yZNIS8wod-0Kgg7gocBjwtCkGSc66oJbZSOygtbxxo4Fr4vBxrpZYlMIlz-d52RBSGySlsN38HyEJYeg1ebrp9D7viSXFM8UARQvVytXT24YdaJXaRSQDxFukCn4meo0KfgmLVju1xphiMdrqpRgF3eBqGlcesq9XPm4EWxf0aaAtAPd8kndKpim7HDSbDFpE4hZLyTG4MZCbMkkXkPBLK2xrIDw2utEcTWUGTwb0.Q0aT327twNqjo6QylD9UhZeXHpXcZZgBSB6PLHVhYRw&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=exercised+book&amp;amp;qid=1761848364&amp;amp;sprefix=exercised+book%2Caps%2C194&amp;amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.amazon.com/Exercised/dp/0141986360/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1N2T1NB5HRXT0&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.r2yZNIS8wod-0Kgg7gocBjwtCkGSc66oJbZSOygtbxxo4Fr4vBxrpZYlMIlz-d52RBSGySlsN38HyEJYeg1ebrp9D7viSXFM8UARQvVytXT24YdaJXaRSQDxFukCn4meo0KfgmLVju1xphiMdrqpRgF3eBqGlcesq9XPm4EWxf0aaAtAPd8kndKpim7HDSbDFpE4hZLyTG4MZCbMkkXkPBLK2xrIDw2utEcTWUGTwb0.Q0aT327twNqjo6QylD9UhZeXHpXcZZgBSB6PLHVhYRw&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=exercised+book&amp;amp;qid=1761848364&amp;amp;sprefix=exercised+book%2Caps%2C194&amp;amp;sr=8-2" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;Exercised: The Science of Physical Activity, Rest and Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujRwf1HdNjk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujRwf1HdNjk" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;2023 interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;The Diary of a CEO&lt;/em&gt;. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Lieberman argues&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lieberman says the idea “natural” humans sleep eight hours is unfounded; field data from communities without electric light show typical nightly sleep of about six to seven hours, contradicting the cultural prescription of eight hours as a target.&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/21/959140732/just-move-scientist-author-debunks-myths-about-exercise-and-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/21/959140732/just-move-scientist-author-debunks-myths-about-exercise-and-sleep" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;He frames modern eight‑hour dogma as a legacy of the Industrial Revolution rather than a biological necessity, and points to epidemiologic curves where risk bottoms out around seven hours, producing a U‑shape with higher risk from both short and long sleep.&lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Popular summaries of his stance emphasize seven hours often outperforms eight for health outcomes, while stressing variability by age and condition, and that sleep need is not one-size-fits-all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How much sleep do you really need?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; explainer&lt;/a&gt;, sleep scientist Rebecca Robbins addresses the eight-hour belief, explaining how the benchmark emerged and offering practical tactics to improve sleep quality rather than fixating on a single number.&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/videos/watch/fact-or-fiction:-do-you-really-need-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night%3F/91338a5f-7719-4d1c-b12c-ac6615421d88" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More than one-third of Americans &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/28/guide-to-better-sleep/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;miss the seven-hour minimum&lt;/a&gt;, underscoring the importance of consistency and sleep hygiene as much as chasing a magic number.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society recommend “seven or more hours per night” for adults—explicitly a range beginning at seven rather than an eight-hour mandate.&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/mayo-clinic/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; guidance aligns: Adults generally need seven or more hours, with individual variation based on age, sleep quality, prior sleep debt, pregnancy, and aging patterns that fragment sleep but do not increase total need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The U‑shaped risk curve&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple large contemporary &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;datasets show&lt;/a&gt; a U‑shaped association between sleep duration and adverse outcomes, with the nadir around seven hours for all‑cause and cardiovascular mortality risk.&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;U.K. Biobank analyses also report U‑shaped relationships, with elevated risks for both short sleep (less than seven hours) and long sleep (often defined as more than nine hours for adults), after adjusting for health and lifestyle factors.&lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.10732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.10732" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mechanistic and biomarker work echoes the U‑shape, with deviations below seven or above eight to nine hours linked to markers of biological aging, though causality can be confounded by illness extending time in bed.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10178027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10178027/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical guidance for sleep&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for seven to nine hours, using seven as a realistic minimum if you wake refreshed and function well; extend toward nine during illness, heavy training, or pregnancy as needed.&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Watch for the U‑shape: chronic short sleep (less than seven hours) and habitual long sleep (more than 9 hours) are both linked to higher risks; if you routinely need more than nine hours, consult a clinician to evaluate for underlying conditions like depression, sleep apnea, or chronic disease.&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.880276/full" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Prioritize consistency and quality—regular bed/wake times, morning light, reduced evening blue light, cool dark bedrooms, and limiting caffeine/alcohol—rather than obsessing over an eight‑hour target.&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The ‘sweet spot’ for sleep&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The eight‑hour rule is a cultural simplification, not a universal biological requirement; seven hours often sits at the health “sweet spot” for many adults, with flexibility around that based on life stage and health.&lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://sleepopolis.com/news/harvard-professor-argues-against-8-hours-of-sleep/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;​&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Business leaders and individuals should reframe sleep goals toward the evidence-based range and measurable daytime function, investing in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/sleep-habits-tips-guide/" class="sc-5ad7098d-0 lcJVdL"&gt;sleep quality practices &lt;/a&gt;that improve performance and long‑term health without enforcing a rigid eight‑hour quota.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 stretched on, scientists watched for all sorts of unintended effects, from social to economic to environmental.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the experts who predict disease transmission wondered specifically whether infectious diseases other than COVID-19 would surge after the prolonged isolation of the population. Would social distancing cause us to have less immunity to common diseases? Would those diseases rebound with deadly consequences?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw4964"&gt;paper published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Georgia’s &lt;a href="https://ecology.uga.edu/directory/toby-brett/"&gt;Tobias Brett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ecology.uga.edu/directory/pejman-rohani/"&gt;Pejman Rohani&lt;/a&gt; explored which infectious diseases were impacted by COVID-19 control measures and, of those, which rebounded. They found airborne diseases were most likely to rebound — but not as much as some feared. Surprisingly, the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases remained low, even long after pandemic-era behaviors changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-medium"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252-300x300.jpeg" alt="Environmental portrait of a man in front of greenery outside" class="wp-image-83406" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/brett_toby-1-e1537387754252.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Tobias Brett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Early in the pandemic, there was some concern raised in the scientific community that lockdowns would disrupt the circulation of other diseases, such as influenza, and this would lead to what are called ‘gaps in immunity.’ So basically, because people aren’t getting infected, they aren’t developing immunity to the disease, and so then you’ve got this big buildup in the susceptible population,” said Brett, lead author of the study and a senior research associate in the &lt;a href="https://ecology.uga.edu/"&gt;Odum School of Ecology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyzing nationwide disease data from 2019 to 2023, the researchers found an increase in cases of airborne diseases like influenza and pertussis after COVID. But fewer Americans got the flu during the pandemic and, while more people started to catch flu again when lockdowns lifted, it didn’t make up for the months when social distance kept flu from spreading.  In other words, Americans caught less flu during the pandemic and the years after than would have been expected without a COVID-19 pandemic and the behavior changes that went with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It means that the fears of a rebound were valid, but the rebound didn’t cancel out the deficit,” he said. “Obviously, there were negative consequences associated with the lockdowns, but in terms of other infectious diseases, the effect wasn’t negative and was, in fact, a net positive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Airborne diseases increased slightly, STIs dropped post-pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brett and Rohani looked at the number of reported cases of 26 different pathogens, clustering them into three groups related to how they are transmitted: airborne/aerosol transmitted diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and environmentally transmitted diseases, such as food poisoning or illnesses spread by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that whether other diseases surged after the pandemic depended largely on how the disease is transmitted. Airborne diseases, such as flu, surged more, while STIs were less affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chlamydia and gonorrhea were on the rise leading into the pandemic, for example. But transmission of those diseases dropped in every state during COVID and stayed lower than expected long after the pandemic ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-300x202.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-101110" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-768x517.jpg 768w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-1536x1034.jpg 1536w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-2048x1379.jpg 2048w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-549x370.jpg 549w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pejman-Rohani-2-1096x738.jpg 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Pejman Rohani (Photo by Peter Frey/UGA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Notifications of those sexually transmitted diseases flatlined, and we don’t know why,” Brett said. “Explanations could include improved treatment practices post-COVID or a greater investment in public health after the COVID pandemic. Another explanation could be changing behavior. It’s definitely a subject for further study.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More broadly, this study highlights the important unanticipated effects of public health measures targeted at one infectious disease for other diseases,” said Rohani, Regents’ Professor and UGA Athletic Association Professor in Ecology and Infectious Diseases. “This points to a need to think holistically about the community of infectious diseases.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alaska ranks as America’s most stressed state&lt;/strong&gt;, driven by the nation’s highest suicide rate (28.15 per 100,000), sky-high living costs 25% above the national average, and harsh isolation that limits access to healthcare and legal resources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts residents experience the lowest stress levels&lt;/strong&gt; in the country with the best safety rating, lowest suicide rate (8.58 per 100,000), and strong access to mental health and legal services despite having the highest cost of living.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal injury lawyers report that state stress levels directly correlate with accident and injury claims&lt;/strong&gt;, as residents in high-stress environments face greater risks from financial strain, poor housing, unsafe working conditions, and delayed medical care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alaska is the most stressed state in the nation, according to a new nationwide study that reveals how geography plays a massive role in American mental health. Researchers analyzed everything from crime rates to air quality across all 50 states and found that where Americans live might matter more than previously thought when it comes to daily pressure and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by Florida personal injury law firm Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine, shows that Alaska earned the dubious distinction of America’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/land-of-the-worried-83-of-americans-very-stressed-over-nations-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most stressed state&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 84.50, more than three times that of Massachusetts, which came in at 24.90. For context, Alaska’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suicide rate&lt;/a&gt; of 28.15 per 100,000 residents is more than triple the national average. Add in a cost of living that runs 25% above the national average and a safety score of just 44.2, and the numbers paint a picture of a population under serious strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“High-stress environments show up in our caseload,” says Marc Anidjar, Founding Senior Partner at Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine. “People dealing with constant &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/debt-america-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial strain&lt;/a&gt;, safety concerns, and poor living conditions face higher rates of accidents and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-fuel-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health crises&lt;/a&gt;. These pressures compound, affecting their overall wellbeing and often leading to legal situations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mental illness affects approximately 51.5 million American adults, or about one in five people. Many of these cases result in stress-related legal claims, and personal injury lawyers are seeing more clients whose health problems stem from chronic pressure and anxiety. But the new research shows that not all states face equal levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-a-state-stressed"&gt;What Makes a State Stressed?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined five key factors to determine stress levels: state safety based on crime statistics, suicide rates indicating mental health struggles, cost of living showing financial burden, environmental quality measured through air pollution and waste management, and the share of residents living in extreme poverty. Higher scores indicate greater &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/open-office-seating-linked-to-lower-stress-greater-activity-levels-among-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After Alaska, New Mexico claimed second place with a stress score of 81.62, followed by Louisiana at 70.20. Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, Kentucky, Arkansas, Washington, and Hawaii rounded out the top 10 most stressed states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Mexico faces serious safety and poverty concerns. With a safety score of just 39.7, residents experience higher crime rates and less security than most other states. New Mexico also has the second-highest suicide rate at 22.76 per 100,000, signaling deep mental health struggles. An alarming 8.20% of the state’s population lives in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poverty-kills-more-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extreme poverty&lt;/a&gt;, one of the highest rates in the nation. Poor environmental conditions, reflected in a cleanliness score of 35.37, add another layer of daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We see how poverty and safety issues intersect in personal injury cases,” explains Anidjar. “When people can’t afford safe housing or reliable transportation, they’re at greater risk for accidents. When they get hurt, they often lack resources for proper medical treatment or legal help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-1200x480.png" alt="Most Stressed States" class="wp-image-145796" srcset="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-1200x480.png 1200w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-475x190.png 475w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-768x307.png 768w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Most-Stressed-States-400x160.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Top 10 Most Stressed States (Credit: Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Louisiana rounds out the top three with the highest extreme poverty rate in the analysis at 9.00%, meaning nearly one in eleven residents struggles to meet basic needs. While the state’s cost of living index of 92.3 sits below the national average, widespread poverty means many residents still can’t make ends meet. Louisiana’s suicide rate of 15.56 reflects the mental health toll of these combined pressures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Louisiana’s poverty crisis creates a cascade of legal issues,” Anidjar notes. “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Financial desperation&lt;/a&gt; leads to unsafe working conditions, inadequate housing, and delayed medical care, increasing the likelihood of injuries and accidents. People in these situations often don’t know their rights or how to access legal protections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-calm-corner-of-america"&gt;The Calm Corner of America&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum, Massachusetts takes the top spot as the least stressed state with a score of just 24.90. Residents of the Bay State enjoy the highest safety rating at 60.2 and the lowest suicide rate at 8.58 per 100,000, less than a third of Alaska’s rate. These numbers reflect a population with better access to mental health resources and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/americans-incarceration-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;safer communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts posts a cleanliness score of 80.97. In this index, higher values represent greater environmental stress. However, residents pay for it. Massachusetts has the highest cost-of-living index in the top ten at 141.2, over 40% above the national average. Despite this, only 5.00% of the population lives in extreme poverty, suggesting most residents can afford the higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Better-resourced states like Massachusetts have stronger safety nets,” Anidjar explains. “People have better access to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare,&lt;/a&gt; mental health services, and legal aid. When accidents or injuries happen, residents can get help more easily, reducing long-term stress and preventing bigger legal problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Jersey claims the second-lowest stress score at 25.72 and the lowest suicide rate in the country at 7.19 per 100,000. With 4.70% living in extreme poverty and a cost of living index of 115.1, New Jersey residents generally have the financial means to handle life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New Jersey’s proximity to major metropolitan areas means better access to specialized medical care and legal services,” says Anidjar. “When people can quickly get help after an injury or mental health crisis, it prevents situations from becoming more serious legal matters.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire rounds out the top three with a stress score of 26.14 and the lowest extreme poverty rate at just 3.90%. Fewer residents struggle with basic needs compared to other states. A safety score of 58.2 and cleanliness score of 73.43 show residents enjoy relatively safe, clean communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-1200x473.png" alt="Least Stressed States" class="wp-image-145797" srcset="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-1200x473.png 1200w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-475x187.png 475w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-768x303.png 768w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Least-Stressed-States-400x158.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Top 10 Least Stressed States (Credit: Anidjar &amp;amp; Levine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-alaska-factor"&gt;The Alaska Factor&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alaska’s isolation creates unique legal challenges that compound stress levels. When someone experiences a stress-related injury or mental health crisis, access to proper medical care and legal resources becomes difficult. Harsh living conditions, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sunlight-winter-weight-gain-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limited sunlight&lt;/a&gt; during winter months, and financial strain make people more vulnerable to accidents and health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basic necessities cost far more in Alaska than in the lower 48 states. Every dollar counts when the cost of living runs 25% above the national average. While Alaska’s extreme poverty rate of 5.60% might seem moderate compared to states like Louisiana, the actual cost of surviving in the Last Frontier makes financial pressure more intense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Living in a high-stress state affects not only your daily mood, but your physical health, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/decision-making/"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;, and overall safety, too,” Anidjar commented. “We’ve seen firsthand how chronic stress contributes to accidents, workplace injuries, and mental health emergencies that require legal support.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People facing constant &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial pressure&lt;/a&gt;, unsafe neighborhoods, or poor environmental conditions need to know that legal protections exist. Whether dealing with a workplace injury, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/adhd-car-accidents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a car accident&lt;/a&gt; caused by poorly maintained roads, or health issues stemming from environmental hazards, Americans have rights that can provide relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many states offer victim compensation programs, workers’ compensation benefits, and personal injury protections that can provide financial relief during difficult times. Free consultations with personal injury attorneys can clarify options without adding financial burden. Understanding legal rights is often the first step toward reducing stress and getting necessary support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For residents of high-stress states like Alaska, New Mexico, and Louisiana, knowing these protections exist can make a real difference when facing accidents or injuries. Meanwhile, residents of lower-stress states like Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New Hampshire benefit from better infrastructure and resources that help prevent crises before they happen. But regardless of where Americans live, understanding available legal protections remains crucial for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt; and recovering from unexpected setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined stress levels across all 50 US states by analyzing five key factors. Safety ratings from 2025 indicate overall state safety based on crime rates and law enforcement data, measured on an index of 0 to 100, where lower safety levels contribute to higher stress. Suicide rates from 2023 measure the number of suicides per 100,000 residents, with higher values suggesting increased mental and social stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost-of-living index from 2025 reflects average &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-rising-living-costs-changing-way-we-date-live-and-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;living costs&lt;/a&gt;, including housing, groceries, healthcare, and utilities, based on a national average of 100, where higher costs indicate higher stress. Cleanliness scores combine three environmental factors from 2023 to 2025: CO₂ emissions data from 2023 measuring total greenhouse gas emissions by state in metric tons of CO₂, air quality index from 2025 showing average annual AQI by state where higher numbers reflect poorer air quality, and landfill density from 2024 measuring the number of active landfills per 10,000 square miles. Each environmental sub-factor was normalized and averaged to create the cleanliness score, with higher scores indicating poorer environmental quality and greater stress contribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Share of population living in extreme poverty from 2024 represents the percentage of residents living below 50% of the poverty line, measured as a percentage where higher values indicate greater financial pressure. To calculate the final stress score, all factors were normalized on a scale of 0 to 1, then averaged and multiplied by 100. A higher score indicates higher overall state stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, a breakthrough study by researchers at the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/bioinformatics-uncovers-regenerative-therapy-for-spinal-cord-injury" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;University of California San Diego (UCSD)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is offering new hope. Using advanced bioinformatics tools, the team has identified an existing drug, Thiorphan, that shows remarkable potential to regenerate damaged nerve cells in the spinal cord, a discovery that could one day transform the treatment of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of computational biology and regenerative neuroscience, scientists have discovered that Thiorphan can stimulate nerve regrowth and restore motor function in animal models. Although still in pre-clinical stages, this finding marks a pivotal step toward therapies that may one day reverse paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The challenge of spinal cord regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human spinal cord has limited ability to repair itself after injury. While nerves in the peripheral nervous system can regenerate to some extent, the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, lacks the same capacity. This makes SCI recovery extremely difficult, often resulting in lifelong disability. Researchers have long sought ways to reawaken the body’s dormant repair mechanisms, but success has been limited until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCSD team turned to bioinformatics, using large molecular databases and computational algorithms to analyse how genes behave during nerve regeneration. They identified specific genetic patterns linked to neuron growth and cross-referenced these with known drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiorphan, a compound previously tested in humans for non-neurological uses, emerged as a top candidate because it triggered a similar gene activation profile associated with nerve repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Testing the drug on human neurons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major technical breakthrough came when scientists managed to grow adult human brain cells in the lab, a notoriously difficult task. When exposed to Thiorphan, these neurons displayed enhanced neurite outgrowth, the process by which nerve fibres extend and reconnect. This provided direct evidence that the drug could stimulate regenerative processes in human neural tissue, not just in animal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate their findings, researchers tested Thiorphan on rats with spinal cord injuries. The results were striking: the treated animals showed a 50% improvement in fine motor function, and when combined with neural stem cell transplants, recovery rates doubled. This synergy between drug therapy and cell transplantation suggests that a multi-pronged approach could be the key to effective spinal cord repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiorphan’s previous safety record in humans could accelerate its path to clinical testing for spinal injuries. This approach, repurposing old drugs using modern computational tools, represents a faster, more efficient model for drug discovery. Instead of starting from scratch, scientists can use gene expression data to identify new uses for existing compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A turning point for spinal injury treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researchers, including neuroscientist Erna van Niekerk, Ph.D., and Professor Mark H. Tuszynski, believe this marks a shift in how we approach neurological repair. By blending AI-driven bioinformatics, gene sequencing, and regenerative cell therapy, they have created a blueprint for future treatments. While human trials are still ahead, the results provide a glimpse into a future where paralysis may no longer be permanent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAJBVV95cUxNQXRwOVhDN0VXN1dLbXBmV0ROSVJQaGl0aEptVTRMMmhjMzJhRUZYLS1xMjRReGE1WWRPX3VOWGprTEl5bDAwQmZ1c2JuZm45QjFMYWxjU0JwVGZhczJCLWt5TXhXR0l1c3l2UmJ1b29VWUU1eVRQcXVQMHdmRkpaQnlZcy1HdVppeGNDRTY1aXIyWGZTQlhaVWFibWw5WXU2WlI1cDlrd3Y3d1dKWWZYZzNFeUpnTTZfNjRpUTBMaFRFMDEzc195U3dYdFMwaGF4eFprZF9iaXZIUmpndW1oQ3QySTFrcEwwMmRzVlNnYk1OSkZ1RW1JdUFfLXBsWlFiS2VuS05LZG5oM21yR0VQM1lWNHZyeVBac1VvdQ</guid></item><item><title>美国肥胖率下降- Slashdot</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/10/30/1641222/obesity-rate-declining-in-us</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="firehose-179916176" data-fhid="179916176" data-fhtype="story" class="fhitem fhitem-story article usermode thumbs grid_24"&gt;

				Gallup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt; After peaking at a record high of 39.9% in 2022, the U.S. adult obesity rate has &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;gradually declined to 37.0% in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. This is a statistically meaningful decrease representing an estimated 7.6 million fewer obese adults compared with three years ago. Meanwhile, diagnoses of diabetes -- a lifetime disease that can be managed but not cured -- have now reached an all-time high of 13.8%. Both metrics are part of the ongoing Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

[...] Over the past year, more Americans have turned to Type 2 antidiabetic GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide (brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) for weight loss purposes. The percentage of adults who report taking this class of medicine specifically for weight loss has increased to 12.4%, compared with 5.8% in February 2024 when Gallup first measured it. Usage among women (15.2%) continues to outpace men (9.7%), but both groups have more than doubled their use in the past year. These results dovetail with increased awareness of the drugs used for weight loss, which has risen from 80% to 89% nationally in the same period.&lt;/i&gt;

"Most women with breast cancer do not have a family history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: A lump is the earliest sign of breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although a lump is one of the most common symptoms of breast cancer, it is not the only sign and can be missed when performing self-examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The whole point of the mammogram is to pick up the earliest signs of a breast cancer, which are usually calcifications, not really a mass," Dr. Preeti Subhedar, breast surgery chief at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"When people come in with a mammographically or image-detected breast cancer, usually it's fairly small and outcomes are really good," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: Breast size affects your cancer risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Subhedar said that breast size has nothing to do with risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"An average-risk woman has a 12% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For high-risk women, this increases to over 20%, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.breastcancer.org/risk/breast-cancer-risk-calculators" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Spencer added that breast size and breast density are often confused, but they're not the same. A mammogram will read dense breasts as having a higher proportion of glandular and fibrous tissue compared to fatty tissue. Mammary glands typically produce milk while fibrous tissue forms the breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This can slightly raise cancer risk and make tumors harder to catch, which is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa-and-mqsa-program/important-information-final-rule-amend-mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;finalized a rule in 2024&lt;/a&gt; requiring providers to inform women if their breast tissue is dense and may require additional follow-up screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: Younger women don't need mammograms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends annual screening mammograms starting at age 40 for average-risk women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For women with a strong family history of breast cancer or a known genetic mutation, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; recommends beginning annual screenings with both a mammogram and a breast MRI at age 30, or even earlier if a close relative was diagnosed at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: A negative mammogram means you don't have breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Experts said a mammogram does not mean a patient doesn't have breast cancer but rather that breast cancer wasn't found on that specific mammogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Mammograms occasionally miss early-stage cancers," noted Spencer. "There is always a chance that you have something that pops up between screenings. We can't say 100%, which is why it's really important to get those yearly screenings." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: Mammograms can cause cancer because of radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The benefit of early detection far outweighs the tiny risk from the small amount of radiation, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The total lifetime risk for radiation-induced breast cancer is still very low at one in 5,000 -- compared to about &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;one in every eight&lt;/a&gt; women who will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and roughly one in 43 women who will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: There are safe and effective alternatives to mammograms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There's no universal replacement for screening mammograms. That is why that is the gold standard," Spencer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Mammograms are safe -- even during pregnancy when needed, she added. Other diagnostic tools including, an MRI and an ultrasound, may be used to provide additional information, but they do not replace the mammogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CLAIM: A breast biopsy spreads breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Medical experts agree that breast biopsies are safe, and the benefit of getting an accurate diagnosis far outweighs the minimal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It is extremely, extremely important that we get a tissue biopsy when someone comes in with an abnormal mammogram because there's a lot of biological information that we learn about a tumor from that biopsy," Spencer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women after skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 2024, more than 300,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and about 40,000 died from the disease.

It’s now surging again in US poultry operations and could result in another winter of high egg prices — and tens of millions of dead birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last two months, the virus was detected on nearly 50 commercial poultry farms, leading to the &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians"&gt;mass culling&lt;/a&gt; of 7.3 million farmed birds — more than during the same period in previous years. Three-quarters of those birds were egg-laying hens from just three egg factory farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Although that culling involves an enormous amount of animal suffering, the deaths represent less than 2 percent of US egg-laying hens, which, for now, isn’t enough to meaningfully affect egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But given the early wave of mortality across a range of species compared to the last couple years, the sheer number of farms that have reported outbreaks, and the fact that a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/health/bird-flu-variant-nevada-human-case"&gt;newer bird flu variant&lt;/a&gt; has become dominant, it “doesn’t bode well for a quiet year” for the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/about-us/people/krysten-schuler"&gt;Krysten Schuler&lt;/a&gt; — an associate research professor of public and ecosystem health at Cornell University — told me in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For nearly four years, bird flu has wreaked havoc on the US poultry industry and the birds themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai-depopulation-disposal.pdf"&gt;Federal policy&lt;/a&gt; requires that as soon as the virus is detected on a farm, the entire flock must be killed to slow the spread of the disease. So far, poultry farms have killed more than &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;180 million birds&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the outbreak in early 2022. And the prevailing method of killing is grim: Producers close barn vents and pump in heat to raise the temperature, which slowly — and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/14/killing-chickens-bird-flu-vsd/"&gt;painfully&lt;/a&gt; — kills the birds via &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians"&gt;heat stroke&lt;/a&gt; over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The virus has also spilled over to infect &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/animal-health/situation-updates/global-aiv-with-zoonotic-potential/bird-species-affected-by-h5nx-hpai/en?fbclid=IwY2xjawJBNJVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHXjrgdsxDiVY31-svDHVEVzSHa3Sq5_ZzJwMkDOcrTzDxK2n5UNopOtyXQ_aem_zvon3ViBbCJLSSONfXFswQ"&gt;hundreds of other bird species and mammals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety"&gt;dairy cows&lt;/a&gt;, foxes, bears, seals, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/risk-factors/bird-flu-in-pets.html"&gt;pet cats&lt;/a&gt;. Seventy human cases have been reported in the US, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/m0106-h5-birdflu-death.html"&gt;one death&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists are increasingly worried that the virus could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00245-6"&gt;evolve into the next human pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s been a costly disease. The government has spent billions to manage it, including compensating egg and dairy producers for their losses, while consumers have spent an additional &lt;a href="https://innovateanimalag.org/hpai-costs-2025"&gt;$14.5 billion on eggs&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 and 2025 alone, according to one estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have questions or comments on this newsletter?&lt;/strong&gt; Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Through it all, the egg, chicken, and turkey industries have relied on improving biosecurity on farms — like sealing barn openings and disinfecting vehicles and equipment — in an effort to keep the virus out and killing infected flocks when that doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Several effective bird flu vaccines for use in poultry birds have been licensed in the US, which you’d think would be a no-brainer solution to the outbreak.

Instead, they would focus on farms located in the &lt;a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/29233-egg-industry-seeks-action-as-hpai-devastates-flocks"&gt;four major flyways&lt;/a&gt; where wild birds migrate and shed the virus, which is where farms have been hardest hit by bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While many egg and turkey producers are eager to start vaccination programs, the US doesn’t let them over concerns that it would impact the chicken meat industry’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last year, chicken meat companies exported &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/poultry-eggs/sector-at-a-glance"&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their product, which is valued at &lt;a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/livestock-and-poultry-market-news/poultry-and-egg-export-volumes-lower-to-close-out-2024"&gt;$4.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;. But most of the countries that import American chicken meat would &lt;a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letter-to-USDA-Re-HPAI-Vaccine.pdf"&gt;pause those imports&lt;/a&gt; if &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; farmed birds in the US are vaccinated, even if no chickens raised for meat are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The reason behind these blanket bans stems from importing countries’ concerns around the so-called “DIVA” problem, which is short for “differentiating infected from vaccinated animals.” It represents the challenge of identifying whether a poultry bird is infected with bird flu or simply has avian influenza antibodies from vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s led the chicken meat industry, for now, to firmly oppose vaccination of any poultry birds in the US. “Until we have written assurances and trade protections in place with our trading partners, we will continue to oppose vaccination for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI),” a spokesperson with the National Chicken Council wrote in an email to Vox. (Losing $4.7 billion in export value would also lead to an oversupply of chicken in the US, which would hurt the industry’s profits.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R9abcrib96:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;In 2022, over 5 million egg-laying hens were culled after bird flu was detected at a farm in Iowa owned by the egg giant Rembrandt.

The USDA surveils the affected area for bird flu and tests birds until the virus is no longer detected and trade resumes once the US has proven that exports are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It would be the same approach here with the vaccination strategy,” John Clifford, a former USDA chief veterinary officer and current adviser to the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, told me. The US would show trading partners “how the US would still protect them, and we would not be shipping them any products that would be unsafe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s precedent for this approach. Since late 2023, France has been vaccinating ducks against the bird flu, which has proven to be &lt;a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/poultry-meat/diseases-health/avian-influenza/news/15768593/france-resumes-hpai-vaccination-program"&gt;highly effective&lt;/a&gt;. But in response, the US and Canada banned poultry imports from France, which the countries lifted early this year after French authorities “succeeded in convincing the American and Canadian authorities of the safety” of vaccination, according to &lt;a href="https://www.euromeatnews.com/Article-United-States-and-Canada-lift-of-embargo-on-poultry-imports-from-France/8118"&gt;Euro Meat News&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccination program has cost French duck producers a little under &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-kicks-off-bird-flu-vaccination-despite-trade-backlash-risk-2023-10-02/"&gt;$2 per bird&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In June, the USDA &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/usda-develops-potential-plan-vaccinate-poultry-bird-flu-2025-06-20/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was developing a vaccination plan to show to countries that import US chicken meat as a way to gauge whether vaccination would disrupt trade. The update represented forward momentum, but some scientific experts, and some in the egg industry, are becoming increasingly impatient with the USDA’s reluctance to allow egg producers to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The agency is, according to them, putting the chicken meat industry’s financial well-being above the massive impacts the bird flu has had on egg, turkey, and dairy producers. I would add that it’s also putting it above American consumers, animal welfare, and broader public health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The USDA didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="actually-measuring-the-cost-of-bird-flu" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actually measuring the cost of bird flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Glenn Hickman, a large egg producer in Arizona who had to cull millions of hens earlier this year, has been direct about how he feels about the status quo. “The reason we’re not vaccinating chickens in this country today is because of trade implications…but I’m past caring,” Hickman &lt;a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/hickman-details-slow-motion-wreck-from-bird-flu"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the agricultural publication Feedstuffs in July. “I’d like to vaccinate my chickens and protect my flock, and I cannot because of the obstacles that the poultry meat industry is putting in front of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The argument that we shouldn’t vaccinate egg-laying hens and turkeys in order to protect $5 billion or so in chicken meat exports doesn’t sit well with &lt;a href="https://vetmed.umn.edu/bio/college-of-veterinary-medicine/carol-cardona"&gt;Carol Cardona&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

But experts say that fact alone does not make it a given that the US would follow the same pattern if it eliminates school vaccination requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida state law currently requires students in public and private schools from daycare through 12th grade to have specific immunisations. Families can opt out for religious or medical reasons. About 11 percent of Florida kindergarteners are not immunised, recent data shows. With Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s backing, Ladapo is pushing to end the state’s school vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The countries Ladapo cited – Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK and parts of Canada – don’t have broad vaccine requirements, research shows. Their governments recommend such protections, though, and their healthcare systems offer conveniently accessible vaccines, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNICEF, a United Nations agency which calls itself the “global go-to for data on children”, measures how well countries provide routine childhood immunisations by looking at infant access to the third dose in a DTaP vaccine series that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 94 percent of one-year-olds in the United States had received three doses of the DTaP vaccine. That’s compared with Canada at 92 percent, Denmark at 96 percent, Norway at 97 percent, Sweden at 96 percent and the UK at 92 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal, government-provided healthcare and high trust in government likely influence those countries’ vaccine uptake, experts have said. In the US, many people can’t afford time off work or the cost of a doctor’s visit. There’s also less trust in the government. These factors could prevent the US from having similar participation rates should the government eliminate school vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="universal-healthcare-stronger-government-trust-increase-vaccination"&gt;Universal healthcare, stronger government trust increase vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies have linked vaccine mandates and increased vaccination rates. Although these studies found associations between the two, the research does not prove that mandates alone cause increased vaccination rates. Association is not the same as causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors that can affect vaccination rates often accompany mandates, including local efforts to improve vaccination access, increase documentation and combat vaccine hesitancy and refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The countries Ladapo highlighted are high-income countries with policies that encourage vaccination and make vaccines accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, for example, where all vaccinations are voluntary, the vaccines included in national programmes are offered for free, according to the Public Health Agency of Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive care is more accessible and routine for everyone in countries such as Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK with universal healthcare systems, said Dr Megan Berman of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the US, our healthcare system is more fragmented, and access to care can depend on insurance or cost,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More limited healthcare access, decreased institutional trust and anti-vaccine activists’ influence set the US apart from those other countries, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these other countries’ cultural norms favour the collective welfare of others, which means people are more likely to get vaccinated to support the community, Berman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anders Hviid, an epidemiologist at Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, told The Atlantic that it’s misguided to compare Denmark’s health situation with the US – in part because Danish citizens strongly trust the government to enact policies in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, as of 2024, fewer than one in three people in the US over age 15 reported having confidence in the national government, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of advanced, industrialised nations. That’s the lowest percentage of any of the countries Ladapo mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effectiveness of recommendations depends on faith in the government and scientific body that is making the recommendations,” said Dr Richard Rupp, of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="without-mandates-vaccine-education-would-be-even-more-important-experts-say"&gt;Without mandates, vaccine education would be even more important, experts say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said they believe US vaccination rates would fall if states ended school vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining high vaccination rates without mandates would require health officials to focus on other policies, interventions and messaging, said Samantha Vanderslott, the leader of the Oxford Vaccine Group’s Vaccines and Society Unit, which researches attitudes and behaviour towards vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be especially difficult given that the United States’s top health official, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, has a long history of anti-vaccine activism and scepticism about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the US an outlier, Vanderslott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Governments tend to promote/support vaccination as a public health good,” she said. It is unusual for someone with Kennedy’s background to hold a position where he has the power to spread misinformation, encourage vaccine hesitancy and reduce mainstream vaccine research funding and access, Vanderslott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people decide to follow recommendations based on their beliefs about a vaccine’s benefits and their child’s vulnerability to disease, Rupp said. That means countries that educate the public about vaccines and illnesses will have better success with recommendations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, experts said that just because something worked elsewhere doesn’t mean it will work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hitchings, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida’s College of Public Health and Health Professions, said a vaccine policy’s viability could differ from country to country. Vaccination rates are influenced by a host of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I said that people in the UK drink more tea than in the US and have lower rates of certain cancers, would that be convincing evidence that drinking tea reduces cancer risk?” Hitchings said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Translate was used throughout the research of this story to translate websites and statements into English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:57:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNRzZiRVFEZWpxLWYxSlVaaGU0VmhCR0RPSk1hWmtfNk8xbndaSFMyeHdIRW9hSUFvWVliVGdzMTlGOTlmVUFqT2FOUFlTdFZhOGlmdzJDU3RaaEt0SElKVUdyODdnekU1OW54UDkyLUZuSmltS003eUc2b2pWYXR5SjZZbWNzTERycTVDNmtlZVdFajZ3SDhHYWRGU3pwNUhRZkdkVGRR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9wdy1KQ092ZWN6XzZNSVN4MVZ3NDFVOXEwaWE3ZzJ6QVh6akJUc1prc0w0aE1ZM0JtOGhkS2VMcGlCTFJNZlJjSEtyRUZxY19ud3lmRFBLYjdPNkg0elo1LUhmM1NXclgxbUllc0pvZVFtWEY5NXFhMWZ4cEFVV191R29UcmlzS01RaV9lNHdDUUVwMTlWeEJzTHhKbU5RLTV0Y2hUVlVYOUNDdw</guid></item><item><title>48张展示我们身体原始力量的病症、伤害和疾病的照片—以及现代医学- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahmarder/absolutely-fascinating-body-photos-fs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz__description

			&lt;p&gt;Honing in on the junk-food pyramid to rank its most harmful members, researchers from Virginia Tech have discovered that ultra-processed meats and beverages are the worst for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who consumed one or more extra servings of either of these foods showed a significantly increased risk of developing cognitive impairments, including those associated with forms of dementia such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178582" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, the researchers tracked 4,750 US residents aged 55 or older to evaluate how their health had evolved over a period of up to 7 years, assessing their cognitive status every two years from 2014 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-daily-diet-of-burgers-and-pizzas-could-be-putting-you-at-risk-of-alzheimers"&gt;A Daily Diet of Burgers And Pizzas Could Be Putting You at Risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-could-sabotage-weight-loss-even-on-a-healthy-diet"&gt;previously explored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;in general&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though researchers had yet to compare discrete categories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health costs of a diet heavy in UPFs are now known to include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2023.09.009"&gt;obesity, type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular diseases, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2024.11.011"&gt;anxiety, depression&lt;/a&gt;, and an increase in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-078476"&gt;all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, diets high in UPFs also have a detrimental impact on brain health. However, a more specific question remained: which specific junk foods were driving these associations, if any?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer (sadly, for many) encompasses some of the most-consumed comfort foods known to culinary science: meats and beverages, meaning that a meat-lover's pizza and a cola could combine to create a double brain-bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178596" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642.jpg" alt="meat and soda" class="wp-image-178596 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178596" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sugary drinks like sodas and heavily processed meats were the big offenders.

They tested both immediate and delayed recall capacity, along with other assessments such as counting backward or subtracting several numbers in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 1,363 of the participants developed cognitive impairment. Those who consumed at least one extra serving of ultra-processed animal products per day showed a 17 percent heightened risk of developing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-diet-soda-a-day-may-raise-your-type-2-diabetes-risk-by-38"&gt;sodas&lt;/a&gt;, iced teas, and sugary fruit drinks, were only a bit less brain-rotting, as individuals who consumed at least one extra serving per day showed a 6 percent increase in the risk of developing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that total UPF consumption was not significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Neither were other UPFs, such as spreads, sweets, savory snacks, grain- and dairy-based foods, or ready-to-eat meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, this new research shows that patients have a simple, if not necessarily easy, avenue for protecting their brain health: making dietary changes to avoid ultra-processed meats and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are things that you can change," &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/09/clahs-food-cognition-research.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brenda Davy, professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise at Virginia Tech and the study's co-author. "It's moderation and being reasonable and balanced in your dietary choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the overabundance of junk food may be shocking. About &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2024.100713"&gt;65 percent of foods and 38 percent&lt;/a&gt; of beverages bought by US households in 2020 were considered UPFs, which are characterized by high industrial processing and the presence of artificial colors, flavorings, and emulsifiers – additives that aren't present in home-cooked meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both the younger generations and older adults get more than half their daily calories from these UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest cooking classes could offer a crucial healthcare intervention – knowing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;what to eat&lt;/a&gt;, and how to prepare it, can be half the battle when making better food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Virginia Tech human development scientist Ben Katz &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/09/clahs-food-cognition-research.html"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;, "It's one thing to follow a diet, but it's another thing to give [people] the cooking skills to prepare that diet." So while the junk-food statistics may seem daunting, at least there's a clear and achievable strategy for dealing with decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525000760"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out, there are a few things going on that create the conditions for brain fog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One is that there is a drop in gray matter volume in regions like the frontal and temporal cortices and the hippocampus—and all of these play major roles in memory and decision-making. (Gray matter makes up the outermost layer of the brain.) These decreases in gray matter are linked with drops in certain types of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It's not all bad, though. The researchers found that gray matter volume may bounce back—at least partially—after menopause, which suggests that the brain may learn to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt; During menopause, researchers also notice more bright spots on brain scans known as white-matter hyperintensities. These lesions are linked to a higher risk of neurological symptoms like cognitive decline and mood changes. This tends to be more common in people who have early menopause or frequent hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The brain also seems to have a higher density of estrogen receptors (which has been linked to memory issues) during menopause, likely due to the brain trying to compensate for falling levels of the hormone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-can-menopause-alter-brain-structure" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why can menopause alter brain structure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The study didn’t break down why all of these changes happen. Instead, it tried to lay out exactly what takes place in the brain during menopause in an effort to explain why some women experience brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But the cause of all of these changes is likely due to the drop in estrogen that naturally happens during menopause, according to &lt;a href="https://www.atlantichealth.org/find-a-doctor/fatima-naqvi-1740383066" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.atlantichealth.org/find-a-doctor/fatima-naqvi-1740383066" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fatima Naqvi, MD" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fatima Naqvi, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an ob-gyn at Atlantic Health. “Our brains are driven by estrogen,” she explains. So, when there is a drop in estrogen in the body, it also can impact the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“If your ovaries are making less estrogen, your brain is going to start to remodel in a way,” Dr. Naqvi says. “Your brain is deciding what will go where, and how it will modify with less estrogen.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But there’s likely more than brain changes that lead to brain fog in menopause, says &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-jennifer-leighdon-wu-md-1366487126" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-jennifer-leighdon-wu-md-1366487126" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Wu, MD" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Wu, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an ob-gyn at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital. “This isn’t just a change in hormones or blood flow,” she says. “Women often aren’t sleeping as well, and lack of sleep is just one thing that can cause brain fog.” Menopause is also often a stressful time, making it understandable that women would have trouble concentrating, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-prevent-and-treat-brain-fog" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;How To Prevent And Treat Brain Fog &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The study authors hope their work will help lead to effective therapies for the cognitive concerns that may come along with menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But in the meantime, there are a few things you can do to set yourself up for more mental clarity. Dr. Naqvi recommends eating “brain food,” like foods rich in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="omega-3 fatty acids" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; (think: fatty fish, walnuts). “That can help prepare your brain to transition,” she says. Exercising regularly and eating a well-balanced diet can help, too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Talking to your healthcare provider about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62734967/hormone-therapy-who-should-take-it/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62734967/hormone-therapy-who-should-take-it/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hormone therapy" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt;—which replaces the estrogen your body stops producing—can also be helpful when you start it earlier in menopause, Dr. Naqvi says. But Dr. Wu cautions against seeing hormone therapy as a cure-all. “Hormone therapy can help with brain fog, but it’s not a magic pill,” she says. “Some patients say they feel like they can think better and sleep better after taking it, while others will say that they feel the same, memory-wise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But, be wary of supplements that promise to help with brain fog, Dr. Naqvi cautions. “It’s a very unregulated industry,” she says. “The best thing to do is to talk to your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study of nearly 800 pet dogs has uncovered a group of &lt;strong&gt;molecules&lt;/strong&gt; that could redefine how we understand &lt;strong&gt;aging&lt;/strong&gt;. These elusive compounds, found in canine blood, are offering scientists a glimpse into the molecular mechanics of longevity. The findings open a new frontier linking the health of dogs and humans in the shared pursuit of a longer, better life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unraveling The Aging Code Through Man’s Best Friend&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70226" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, scientists from &lt;strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/strong&gt;, and collaborating institutions analyzed blood samples from nearly 800 dogs enrolled in the &lt;strong&gt;Dog Aging Project&lt;/strong&gt;. Their findings identified a remarkable subset of molecules—known as &lt;em&gt;post-translationally modified amino acids&lt;/em&gt; (ptmAAs)—that appear to mirror the pace of&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/naked-mole-rats-dna-mutation-aging/" data-type="post" data-id="90723"&gt; biological aging&lt;/a&gt;. These metabolites, often tied to &lt;strong&gt;kidney function&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/strong&gt;, may provide an unprecedented molecular fingerprint of how living organisms grow old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These molecules, known as metabolites, are basically the building blocks of life,” says &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Promislow&lt;/strong&gt;, a senior scientist and scientific advisor at the &lt;strong&gt;HNRCA&lt;/strong&gt; and the study’s lead author. “They serve as the raw materials for forming proteins, DNA, and other cellular components, and play a critical role in keeping cells alive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that nearly &lt;strong&gt;40% of small molecules&lt;/strong&gt; in canine blood vary with age, revealing how internal chemistry transforms over time. By mapping these molecular shifts, researchers aim to decode not just how dogs age—but also what that might mean for &lt;strong&gt;human longevity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(a) The geographic distribution of 784 dogs from the Precision Cohort. The number of dogs enrolled from each of the 50 United States is indicated by the color scale (range 1–79 dogs, white = 0 dogs). (b) The age distribution by sex for the Precision Cohort (c) Based on the ancestry estimated from among 115,427 SNPs (Methods), 148 of the dogs consist of one of eight common breeds (those with at least eight dogs and at least 85% ancestry), and that also have representation from both sexes. The remaining 636 dogs were of either an under-represented breed, had ancestries from more than one breed, or did not include both sexes (Newfoundlands). (d) Dog weight at the time of blood collection for the most common breeds (upper panel), and for all other dogs (lower panel). (e) The number of dogs (note the log10 scale) at each general health category as given by owner reports. The upper panel summarizes the baseline Precision Cohort and the lower panel summarizes 47,444 dogs in the remainder of the DAP. Most Precision dogs (92%) were either in “Excellent” or “Very good” health, and no Precision dogs were categorized below “Fair”, whereas 0.8% of all DAP dogs were listed as being in “Poor” or “Very Poor” health. (f) Dogs reported to be in better general health were younger, on average, than dogs reported to be in worse health.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How The Gut And Kidneys Shape The Pace Of Aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key insight from the study lies in the connection between &lt;strong&gt;gut microbes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;kidney function&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;protein breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;. The identified ptmAAs are produced either by intestinal bacteria during digestion or as a result of protein degradation inside the body. When kidney performance declines, these compounds tend to accumulate in the bloodstream, suggesting a biochemical signature of deteriorating cellular function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery adds a new layer of understanding to the biology of aging. Rather than focusing solely on genetic or environmental factors, the study places molecular byproducts at the center of the discussion. By tracking how these metabolites fluctuate with age, researchers can begin to determine whether they simply reflect aging—or actively drive it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential implications stretch far beyond veterinary science. If similar processes occur in humans, these biomarkers could one day help predict &lt;strong&gt;disease risk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;organ health&lt;/strong&gt;, or even &lt;strong&gt;lifespan potential&lt;/strong&gt;, paving the way for personalized anti-aging therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

The FDR threshold of α = 0.05 is shown in red and representative metabolites are labeled.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Dogs To Humans: A Shared Future Of Healthier Aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next phase of the research will monitor the same dogs over several years, building a &lt;strong&gt;longitudinal dataset&lt;/strong&gt; that captures how these metabolites evolve over time. Scientists will also analyze whether shifts in gut bacteria or &lt;strong&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt; correlate with the appearance of specific ptmAAs—offering a dynamic view of the aging process in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a tremendous opportunity to understand the causes and consequences of aging and to discover ways to ensure that both species enjoy the healthiest aging trajectory possible,” Promislow says. This vision underscores a deeper philosophy driving the &lt;strong&gt;Dog Aging Project&lt;/strong&gt;—that by understanding the biology of our closest companions, we may unlock the secrets of our own healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the study’s findings could help identify &lt;strong&gt;biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt; that predict not just how long we live, but how well we age—reshaping preventive medicine for both humans and dogs alike.&lt;/p&gt;

This model paired cells from the lining of lymphatic vessels with meningeal cells. This enabled the team to tease apart the isolated effects of chemo on each cell's function. They also grew healthy mouse meningeal tissue in lab dishes to assess any structural changes triggered by the drug exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the drug docetaxel disrupted the cells in the human meningeal lymphatic model by reducing their coverage and length. The treatment also shrank the vessels within the mouse tissues and reduced the number of loops in the network structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers ran experiments with live mice, comparing mice treated with docetaxel to mice unexposed to the drug. Mice with cancerous tumors that were given the drug tended to have narrower meningeal lymphatic vessels, as well as fewer loops, compared to untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to see whether these docetaxel-induced structural changes led to impaired memory or changes in behavior. They found that healthy mice treated with docetaxel forgot objects they had previously seen, while the untreated mice showed clear signs of remembering them. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/39074-what-is-an-mri.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/39074-what-is-an-mri.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MRI scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the treated mice indicated that these cognitive issues correlated with the decreased flow of fluids through the lymphatic vessels, the authors wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munson cautioned that this is an early-stage study and that there are many gaps left in our understanding of the link between "chemo brain" and meningeal lymphatics. She explained that one limitation of the research was that the chemotherapy drugs were administered over relatively short time periods, whereas chemotherapy courses for human cancer patients often last months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="981ec733-2297-4e35-b3d0-e3b154e58a92"&gt;Similarly, the memory issues the mice experienced were tested over a couple of days, whereas humans can sometimes experience chemo brain for years following treatment. "So it's possible that these lasting effects that we see in [human] patients may have different mechanisms that may not be captured fully here," Munson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to replicate this research using samples from many individuals of different ages and to compare outcomes between tumor-bearing and tumor-free mice, to see if there's a difference in how the chemotherapy affects them, Munson said. She hopes that, eventually, this research will provide a new target for treating this side effect of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, this work underscores the need to consider not only survival, but also the long-term, often overlooked neurological side effects of cancer treatment on cognitive well-being and quality of life," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://beam.vt.edu/people/faculty/roberts.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://beam.vt.edu/people/faculty/roberts.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monet Roberts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and mechanics at Virginia Tech, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="0ad5b6d0-c4d2-49dc-9d7d-714cffca3baa"&gt;

            Happier people are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069072717751441" target="_blank"&gt;more successful in their careers&lt;/a&gt;, have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12910" target="_blank"&gt;more fulfilling relationships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743519302300" target="_blank"&gt;live longer, healthier lives&lt;/a&gt;, previous research has shown. Now, scientists say they have identified the “happiness threshold” needed for a country’s population as a whole to achieve certain health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00013b6n6mtuiz71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, a nation’s happiness level can influence its people’s risk of premature death from chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and respiratory disease, according to a study published October 20 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1667645/full" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00023b6nggl0u0p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research team used a scale called the Life Ladder to estimate the happiness levels of 123 countries. Zero represents the worst possible life imaginable and 10 the best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00033b6nes3lqevn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once a country surpassed a score of 2.7, its happiness was tied to a decrease in deaths due to chronic or noncommunicable diseases among people 30 to 70 years old, researchers found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00043b6n1sumygob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scores ranged from 2.18 to 7.97, with an average of 5.45. The United States was among the countries analyzed, but individual Life Ladder scores weren’t published in the study. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/worlds-happiest-countries-2025-wellness"&gt;2025 World Happiness Report&lt;/a&gt;, ranks the US as the world’s 24th-happiest country, with a score of 6.72.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00053b6ngkeg119x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Policies that lift national Life-Ladder scores above the 2.7 threshold — through investments in health systems, anti-corruption reforms, social safety nets, and healthy urban environments — can initiate a reinforcing cycle of higher happiness and lower mortality,” lead study author Iulia Iuga said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00063b6nt2kfjb1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evidence suggests that raising well-being while curbing obesity, alcohol use, and pollution could produce dual dividends: stronger happiness and healthier, longer lives.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00073b6nlmovj9cc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For countries at or above the 2.7 threshold, “improving well-being can measurably extend &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/global-mortality-risk-factors-adolescents-young-adults"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; when societies reach a basic level of stability and satisfaction,” said Iuga, a professor in the department of finance and accounting at 1 Decembrie 1918 University of Alba Iulia in Romania.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00083b6nukkd5aki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Iuga hopes her team’s work has implications for governing bodies and public health organizations that can influence happiness and health at the population level. She plans to continue her research by testing the happiness threshold against other health metrics, such as years lived with a disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmhcml8d0000b3b6nl0qijsgs@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="more-than-just-fun-and-pleasure" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        ‘More than just fun and pleasure’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00093b6nvhs7k28n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each 1% increase in well-being correlated to a 0.43% decrease in the chronic-disease mortality rate among adults 30 to 70 years old, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d000a3b6n5bo4hhh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This research adds to the existing body of literature linking happiness to health, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a distinguished professor of psychology and director of the Positive Activities and Well-Being Laboratory, or &lt;a href="https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/pawlab/" target="_blank"&gt;PAWLab&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhck9gnf000r3b6nlen3d8dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Traditionally, happiness is seen as a little bit of a luxury. It feels good,” Lyubomirsky said. The new study shows “that happiness could be the public health variable. It’s about more than just fun and pleasure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000e3b6nqm0qgitk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Happiness is but one facet of a person’s health. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness"&gt;Genetic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/health/alcohol-dementia-risk-study-wellness"&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/30/health/airborne-microplastics-study-wellness"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; factors also play a role in the risk of dying from chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000f3b6ncdisn5ca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t want to leave people the impression that if only they were happier, they would be healthier, they would be fine,” Lyubomirsky said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000g3b6npcul1ff3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to avoid placing blame, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000h3b6nk0kj015l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You don’t want to say, ‘If you don’t live as long, then it’s your fault because you’re not happy enough,’” she said. Not to mention, you only have so much control over your happiness as it relates to where you live. You might be born into a politically unstable country through no fault of your own or unable to afford to move out of an area with poor air quality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000i3b6n6nfss9q0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having spent decades studying the well-being of individuals, Lyubomirsky said gauging the happiness of entire countries comes with challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000j3b6n3w5x0fjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really hard,” she said. “You cannot get a sample of every single person in the country, so you want to make sure that’s a representative sample.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000k3b6ne19nc56c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers cited incomplete data on countries in conflict and low-income nations as a limitation of the study. In addition, longevity analysis is limited because mortality data for noncommunicable diseases didn’t go beyond age 70.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000l3b6nhwq44s25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saida Heshmati, director of the Human Emotion and Relationships across Time and Culture, or &lt;a href="https://heshmatiheartlab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HEART Lab&lt;/a&gt;, at Claremont Graduate University in California, said happiness isn’t the word she’d use to describe what the study is trying to measure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000m3b6nc42g2tbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we say ‘happiness,’ people tend to think about experiencing more positive emotions — joy and having meaning in life and having a sense of accomplishment,” said Heshmati, also an assistant professor of psychology, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The (Life Ladder) doesn’t necessarily get into those components.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckjjpd00133b6n6rrnt16p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati referred to the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-94-007-0753-5_259" target="_blank"&gt;Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called Cantril’s Ladder, a standardized well-being assessment that serves as the basis for the Life Ladder scores in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000o3b6nrb9z7nao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t about happiness as a fleeting emotion,” Heshmati said. “It’s really about this general life satisfaction cognitive evaluation, which is a reflection of whether societies are providing those material, social and psychological foundations for people to thrive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000q3b6nfhu9m2t9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors of the new study pulled data about health factors including air pollution, body mass index and alcohol consumption from the &lt;a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318875/global-research.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Gallup World Poll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators" target="_blank"&gt;World Development Indicators&lt;/a&gt; collected from 2006 through 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000r3b6ns6a6wbha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Noncommunicable diseases accounted for at least 43 million deaths globally, or 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths, in 2021, according to WHO. Nearly 42% of those people died prematurely, before age 70.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckkoki001e3b6ndvgnnxqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eighty percent of premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases that year were attributed to four disease groups: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/health/heart-disease-risk-factors-wellness"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; (19 million deaths); &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/health/early-onset-colorectal-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; (10 million deaths); &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/health/copd-lung-disease-wellness"&gt;chronic respiratory disease&lt;/a&gt; (4 million deaths); and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/health/diabetes-undiagnosed-half-of-americans-wellness"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (2 million deaths).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000t3b6nb0ejwfy2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Countries with higher per-person health spending — what a person spends on doctor visits and prescription medications, for example — generally exceeded the happiness threshold. Ethiopia had the lowest per-capita spending at $9 in 2006, while the US had the highest at $12,000 in 2021. The average across all countries evaluated was $1,300.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000u3b6ngpjlk2sf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati likes to think of the happiness threshold as a stability threshold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000v3b6nzsl0s9ga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re below that threshold, it seems you’re in stress mode and survival mode,” she said, which can have physiological consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckjyr000193b6nxk5tugdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While individual well-being adds up to represent the happiness of a nation, Heshmati cautions against applying the study’s conclusions to your own health and risk of death from chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000x3b6n1q8q2i8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can’t just say that becoming or feeling slightly happier directly changes your biology,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000y3b6n2dsllmzt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati recommends thinking about your own happiness holistically. Simple pleasures matter, she said, but they come and go and can leave a sense of emptiness due to their fleeting nature. Instead, focus on lasting markers of well-being such as maintaining strong social ties, cultivating a sense of purpose and pursuing goals that make you feel accomplished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000z3b6nm98vppaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those are more of the long-term virtues that help us live life to the fullest,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Hubble bubble toil and trouble” is a quote from Shakespeare’s Macbeth that conjures images of evil witches making potions in giant cauldrons. But the truth was that women persecuted as witches were probably legitimate healers of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 14th century, women healers were &lt;a href="https://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Phil%20281b/Philosophy%20of%20Magic/Arcana/Witchcraft%20and%20Grimoires/case_witchhunts.html"&gt;generally tolerated&lt;/a&gt; throughout Europe, offering one of the only kinds of medicine available at the time. But from the 14th to the mid-18th century, with the rise of university education, &lt;a href="https://www.gendercide.org/case_witchhunts.html"&gt;coupled with the increasing power of the church&lt;/a&gt;, women healers were often demonised. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University graduates &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-middle-ages-female-doctors-were-consigned-to-oblivion-197756"&gt;were favoured instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.museumofcambridge.org.uk/wise-women-traditional-cures-and-remedies/"&gt;Women folk healers&lt;/a&gt; were now commonly labelled as “witches” and subjected to torture and execution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valuable medicinal knowledge &lt;a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/discover-wild-science-318442312/4038749972530-why-witch-hunts-may-have-destroyed-centuries-of-medical-knowledge%5D"&gt;may have gotten lost&lt;/a&gt; along the way. To rediscover this ancient knowledge, researchers are looking in more detail at some of the major ingredients used in these medicines and assess their scientific worth through a modern lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most famous potions documented in records of medieval treatments were said to contain exotic ingredients such as eye of newt, toe of frog, wool of bat, tongue of dog and adder’s fork. But these were actually &lt;a href="https://libnews.umn.edu/2017/10/shakespearean-recipe-witchs-brew/"&gt;synonyms for plants&lt;/a&gt; and not animal parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, animal parts such as frogs and toads were indeed also used in other recipes used by the healers of the time, often for their &lt;a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/toad-lore-the-natterjack-at-the-edges-of-occult-history/"&gt;psychoactive properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the plants folk healers used were native to Europe. But there were also some &lt;a href="https://historymedieval.com/herbal-medicine-in-the-middle-ages/#google_vignette"&gt;exotic ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, obtained through the &lt;a href="https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/2934/3/2934%20Cobb%2C%20M.%20%282024%29%20Spices%20in%20the%20Ancient%20World.pdf"&gt;spice trade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/spice-trade"&gt;which began&lt;/a&gt; as early as the fifth century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eye of newt is mustard seed, most likely the European species &lt;em&gt;Sinapis alba&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583/full"&gt;Modern research has shown&lt;/a&gt; it has anti-cough, anti-asthma, anti-inflammatory, anti-nerve damage, anti-androgenic, cardioprotective and anti-tumour effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classical formulations containing dried mustard seed, handed down from ancient medical books or ethnic medical experience, are now widely used in herbal clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wool of bat is common holly leaves, and has been shown to reduce high levels of fats in the blood, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8750822/"&gt;including high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. It also contains some compounds &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/holly"&gt;that are toxic&lt;/a&gt; and so self-medication isn’t recommended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tongue of dog is actually a plant known as hound’s tongue, attributed to the long leaf shape. It has a history of use across the world for a variety of ailments including malaria, hepatitis and tuberculosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of group of natural compounds called pyrrolizidine alkaloids render it &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1325283/full"&gt;highly toxic to the liver&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any research showing medicinal promise has to be viewed with some caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Hound’s tongue is really a wildflower.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/barrelieris-hounds-tongue-wild-blue-flowering-2632455753"&gt;Giulumian/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adder’s fork refers most likely to the fern, English adder’s tongue, primarily used in folk medicine for wound healing and for promoting healthy blood circulation. It has also been exploited for its &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11944642/"&gt;skin-enhancing properties&lt;/a&gt; by the cosmetic industry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Witches’ brews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witchcraft and folk healing are two different arts. However, medieval folk healing did involve elements of superstition, astrological lore and even pagan ritual and &lt;a href="https://libjournals.unca.edu/ncur/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1937-Casey-Abigail-FINAL.pdf"&gt;so the line between&lt;/a&gt; compassionate healer and witch could easily be misrepresented by those in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight ointments, sleep potions and love potions are often mentioned &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9020611/"&gt;both in historical records&lt;/a&gt; and fictional literature. Commonly containing a potent class of chemical compounds called tropane alkaloids (a class that also includes cocaine), these concoctions would have had some interesting effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight ointments were applied to a broomstick and to parts of the body with blood vessels close to the surface to aid absorption. There has been much colourful debate as to the exact parts of the body that these ointments were applied to, but &lt;a href="https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2054/3/2/article-p164.xml"&gt;the extremities&lt;/a&gt; are most frequently mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be viewed as an early form of transdermal application, now found in the delivery of some drugs such as nicotine patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These alkaloids, derived from plants of the Solanaceae (potato) family, including deadly nightshade and henbane have intoxicating psychoactive effects, including feelings of lightness, delirium and hallucinations. These effects could &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6412926/"&gt;easily be experienced&lt;/a&gt; as feelings of flying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep potions often used extracts from foxglove and extracts from the plant Indian snakeroot, containing the drug reserpine, the world’s first drug treatment for high blood pressure. It was reportedly rediscovered after the founder of the Indian herbal medicine company, Himalaya, observed its calming effects on &lt;a href="https://himalayaglobalholdings.com/pages/serpina"&gt;restless elephants&lt;/a&gt; during a trip to Burma in the 1930s, hundreds of years after its use in medieval times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Foxgloves are more than a country garden flower.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/foxglove-flower-digitalis-purpurea-trees-background-1600857613"&gt;backcornermedia/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these plants and their compounds produce symptoms such as reduced heartbeat, inhibition of adrenaline release and drowsiness, all things that might aid in a restful night’s sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love potion recipes called for ingredients such as the mandrake plant &lt;em&gt;Mandragora officinalis&lt;/em&gt;. The root is a rich source of the same alkaloids found in the sleep potions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may appear counter-intuitive but higher doses of these compounds are known to produce increased heartbeat, palpitations and sweating rather than drowsiness. Other plants such as &lt;em&gt;Ephedra sinica&lt;/em&gt; (containing a stimulant called ephedrine) and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11900630/"&gt;psychoactive &lt;em&gt;Areca catechu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (betel nut) have stimulant and euphoric effects linked to increases in adrenaline and serotonin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sleep potion can be transformed into a love potion, and should love turn to hate, a further increase in dosage would transform these plants into poisons. So it’s unsurprising that accusations associated with poisoning and witchcraft &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5309/willmaryquar.69.2.0235?seq=6"&gt;were more commonplace&lt;/a&gt; during the heightened witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries as a means to prosecute women healers under the law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutions for witchcraft didn’t come to an end in England until the early 18th century when the 1736 witchcraft act repealed earlier legislation and &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5309/willmaryquar.69.2.0235?seq=8"&gt;made it a crime&lt;/a&gt; to either pretend to be a witch or to accuse someone of practising witchcraft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 1736 act, the witches (and folk healers) were left alone for a while although &lt;a href="https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/id/eprint/14240/1/Witchcraft_accusations_1_.pdf"&gt;still encountered difficulties&lt;/a&gt; from the church and establishment at times. Nonetheless the act of prescribing potions continued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of prescribing herbal pills, potions and salves as a herbal medicine practitioner eventually became a &lt;a href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-profiles/medical-herbalist"&gt;legitimate occupation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one still dominated by women &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9452627/"&gt;to this day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
