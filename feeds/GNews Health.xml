So why that is important?" Cheng said. "Because not all patients need opioids, and not all patients need a strong opioid. ...

The family had donated the patient's body to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team learned that pig organs were being rejected due to an immune system reaction from specific antibodies -- which recognize and attach themselves to foreign substances so they can be removed from the body -- and from T cells, which are white blood cells that help the body fight off germs and other unfamiliar invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;'So you have this very coordinated immune response that involves antibodies and white cells, and it seems to happen somewhere between two and four weeks after the transplant," said Montgomery, lead author of the study. "Now the good news on that front is that we can detect when it's coming before rejection happens, and we can begin to respond, and we have very good therapeutics that can block the rejection and prevent it from causing damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;After rejection, the team used an FDA-approved drug combination to successfully reverse it, with no signs of permanent damage or reduced kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a second study, Montgomery and his team looked at the body's immune response to the pig organ in greater detail. By measuring levels of biomarkers in the blood, they were able to spot an attack up to five days before it would be visible in bodily tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Montgomery said the findings could lead to a future where gene-edited pig organs are a realistic alternative to human organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The pig organ can really replace a human organ and do all the things that a human organ can do, and it's really just a matter of overcoming the immunosuppression and preventing rejection," he said. "I think it's going to happen ... and people will be receiving xenotransplants on a regular basis. It's going to be normalized, and it's going to be something that will benefit thousands, first, and then millions of people around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;FDA clears 1st blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In May, the FDA cleared the first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The test, manufactured by Fujirebio Diagnostics, is for those aged 55 and older who are already exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease, according to the federal health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The new blood test works by measuring the ratio of two proteins -- pTau217 and β-amyloid 1-42 -- which are found in human plasma, a component of blood.

These incoming signals are created when neurons release glutamate, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in brain communication. Although glutamate is essential for processes like learning and memory, its activity has been extremely difficult to measure because the signals are faint and happen very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new tool makes it possible to detect those subtle chemical messages as they arrive, giving researchers access to a part of brain communication that has long been hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this discovery matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to observe incoming signals allows scientists to study how neurons process information. Each brain cell receives thousands of inputs, and how it combines those signals determines whether it produces an output. This process is thought to underlie decisions, thoughts, and memories, and studying it directly could help explain how the brain performs complex computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advance also opens new paths for disease research. Problems with glutamate signaling have been linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and others. By measuring these signals more precisely, researchers may be able to identify the biological roots of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug development could also benefit. Pharmaceutical companies can use these sensors to see how experimental treatments affect real synaptic activity, which may help speed up the search for more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing a powerful glutamate sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein was engineered by researchers at the Allen Institute and HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. Known as iGluSnFR4 (pronounced 'glue sniffer'), it acts as a molecular "glutamate indicator." Its sensitivity allows it to detect even the weakest incoming signals exchanged between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By revealing when and where glutamate is released, iGluSnFR4 provides a new way to interpret the complex patterns of brain activity that support learning, memory, and emotion. It gives scientists the ability to watch neurons communicate inside the brain in real time. The findings were recently published in Nature Methods and could significantly change how neural activity is measured and analyzed in neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How brain cells communicate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the impact of this advance, it helps to look at how neurons interact. The brain contains billions of neurons that communicate by sending electrical signals along branch-like structures called axons. When an electrical signal reaches the end of an axon, it cannot cross the small gap to the next neuron, which is known as a synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the signal triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Glutamate is the most common of these chemical messengers and plays a key role in memory, learning, and emotion. When glutamate reaches the next neuron, it can cause that cell to fire, continuing the chain of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From fragments to the full conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can be compared to falling dominos, but it is far more complex. Each neuron receives input from thousands of others, and only certain combinations and patterns of activity will trigger the receiving neuron to fire. With this new protein sensor, scientists can now identify which patterns of incoming activity lead to that response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, observing these incoming signals in living brain tissue was nearly impossible. Previous technologies were too slow or lacked the sensitivity needed to measure activity at individual synapses. As a result, researchers could only see pieces of the communication process rather than the full exchange. This new approach allows them to capture the entire conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making sense of neural connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like reading a book with all the words scrambled and not understanding the order of the words or how they're arranged," said Kaspar Podgorski, Ph.D., a lead author of the study and senior scientist at the Allen Institute. "I feel like what we're doing here is adding the connections between those neurons and by doing that, we now understand the order of the words on the pages, and what they mean."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before protein sensors like iGluSnFR4 were available, researchers could only measure outgoing signals from neurons. This left a major gap in understanding, since the incoming signals were too fast and too faint to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neuroscientists have pretty good ways of measuring structural connections between neurons, and in separate experiments, we can measure what some of the neurons in the brain are saying, but we haven't been good at combining these two kinds of information. It's hard to measure what neurons are saying to which other neurons," Podgorski said. "What we have invented here is a way of measuring information that comes into neurons from different sources, and that's been a critical part missing from neuroscience research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration behind the breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The success of iGluSnFR4 stems from our close collaboration started at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus between the GENIE Project team and Kaspar's lab. That research has extended to the phenomenal in vivo characterization work done by the Allen Institute's Neural Dynamics group," said Jeremy Hasseman, Ph.D., a scientist with HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. "This was a great example of collaboration across labs and institutes to enable new discoveries in neuroscience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new window into brain function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery overcomes a major limitation in modern neuroscience by making it possible to directly observe how neurons receive information. With iGluSnFR4 now available to researchers through Addgene, scientists have a powerful new tool to explore brain function in greater detail. As this technology spreads, it may help reveal answers to some of the brain's most enduring questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Keith Ellis, the medical director of cardiology at Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital in Texas. “Or typically, people describe a butterfly in the chest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluttering might be harmless. But it might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said the concern comes if a person experiences atrial fibrillation, which, if left untreated, can increase a person’s risk of stroke, heart failure and cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said doctors see an increase in patients with A-fib around the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anybody, regardless of their health status, can experience holiday heart syndrome. But there are health factors that increase the risk of experiencing holiday heart syndrome. Those include age, high blood pressure, diabetes and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption plays a big factor in holiday heart syndrome, Ellis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated heavy drinking can shift what starts as a temporary disturbance into chronic A-fib, according to Houston Methodist. Five drinks a day increases A-fib risk by almost 50%, the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2025/dec/holiday-heart-syndrome-why-your-heart-might-be-working-overtime-this-season/" target="_blank"&gt;Holiday heart syndrome symptoms&lt;/a&gt; typically show up 12 to 36 hours after drinking and can include rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or sudden fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to limiting alcohol, Ellis said people can reduce their risk of experiencing holiday heart syndrome by staying hydrated, going easy on the salt, getting enough sleep, and staying physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said anyone who experiences persistent palpitations, which he described as over 30 seconds, should reach out to their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I typically advise patients that if you experience any type of fluttering or palpitation to definitely reach out to your physician in consultation,” he said. “And there are a number of devices that are available that allow us to monitor a person's heart rhythm in the outpatient setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:07:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQdWZEczlNOTd6SkNzbE4yN3Jad3pacVhpZ2dSdXJObk5HSzRiZURaUGpWOU5GT190T21zQnFzaF9LMFNzOERDODIzM2VmRVBmbkFUQUVEMmRCRmo2N0xXdVh0NDNyblNvYkJNM0VoOGxZb09NYndWcUhQOFdaSGJvbzhnVkVKV2xzNFpnbHRHcjlvMVVqTFpjUXB4b045aEI2aUpaVkNQbUQ3UnptRkRudEJ3WVdyWnc</guid></item><item><title>流感病例在假期旅行、聚会、疾病预防控制中心最新数据显示中呈上升趋势- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/flu-cases-rise-amid-holiday-travel-gatherings-latest/story?id=128761006</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Flu activity is increasing across the U.S. amid holiday travel and gatherings, according to the latest data the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC estimates there have been at least 4.6 million illnesses, 49,000 hospitalizations and 1,900 deaths from flu this season so far, according to data updated as of Dec. 19, and experts expect these numbers will continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Public health experts previously told ABC News that many of this season's cases are linked to a new flu strain called subclade K -- a variant of the H3N2 virus, which is itself a subtype of influenza A -- that has been circulating since the summer in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the 163 samples of H3N2 viruses collected since Sept. 28 and genetically characterized, 89% were subclade K, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, three pediatric flu deaths have been reported so far this season, according to an ABC News tally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last season, the U.S. saw 288 children die from flu, which is the same number of children who died during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

This difference supports the theory that an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling may contribute to autism-related traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG data also showed that electrical activity linked to lower receptor availability can be detected noninvasively, suggesting a more accessible way to study excitatory function in autism.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; has found that brains of autistic people have fewer of a specific kind of receptor for glutamate, the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The reduced availability of these receptors may be associated with various characteristics linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found this really important, never-before-understood difference in autism that is meaningful, has implications for intervention, and can help us understand autism in a more concrete way than we ever have before,” says James McPartland, PhD, Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry and Psychology in the Child Study Center at YSM and the study’s co-principal investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Signaling imbalance in autism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the brain communicate with one another using electrical signals and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. When an electrical current propagates through a neuron, it prompts the release of neurotransmitters that relay a signal to other neurons. This signaling in the brain can be either excitatory or inhibitory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excitatory signaling primarily triggers the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and it acts as a green light telling other neurons to fire. Inhibitory signaling, on the other hand, acts as a brake that suppresses activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain needs a precise balance of these two types of signaling in order to function properly. One of the leading hypotheses on the underlying causes of autism is an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers propose the involvement of this central mechanism might explain the wide range of differences observed among autistic individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this hypothesis, the researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to look for differences in the brains of 16 autistic adults and 16 people considered neurotypical. MRI scans enabled the researchers to examine the anatomy of each of the participants’ brains, while PET scans revealed how the brains were functioning at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PET scans can help us pinpoint a molecular map of what’s going on in this glutamate system,” says David Matuskey, MD, associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at YSM, and co-principal investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Autistic brains have reduced availability of a crucial receptor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These analyses revealed less brain-wide availability of a specific kind of glutamate receptor, known as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) in autistic participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support the idea that an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain could be contributing to traits associated with autism, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen of the autistic participants also underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG), a measure of electrical activity of the brain. Based on the EEG, the researchers identified that these electrical measurements were associated with lower mGlu5 receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could have significant clinical implications, the researchers say. While PET scans are a powerful tool for studying the brain, they are also costly and involve exposure to radiation. EEG could be a cheaper and more accessible way to further investigate excitatory function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EEG isn’t going to completely replace PET scans, but it might help us understand how these glutamate receptors might be contributing to the ongoing brain activity in a person,” says Adam Naples, PhD, assistant professor in the Child Study Center at YSM and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gives the researchers novel mechanistic insight into how the brains of autistic individuals are different from those of neurotypical people. Because the molecular underpinnings of autism are still so poorly understood, clinicians today rely on behavioral observation to diagnose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elucidating the “molecular backbone” of autism, researchers say, could potentially lead to better diagnostic tools and ways to support autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, I go into a room and play with a child to diagnose autism,” says McPartland, “Now, we’ve found something that is meaningful, measurable, and different in the autistic brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no medications that treat the difficulties experienced by many with autism. The findings could also help researchers come up with therapeutics for autism that target the mGlu5 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many neurodivergent people aren’t hindered by autism and may not need or want medication, novel treatments could help those on the spectrum that experience symptoms that affect their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study only included autistic adults. It is still unclear whether the lower receptor availability is a driver of autism or a result of living with it for decades. Previously, research involving PET scans has been limited to adults due to the risks associated with radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Matuskey, co-investigator Richard Carson, PhD, and their colleagues have developed more sophisticated techniques that open a pathway for much lower exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future studies, the team plans to conduct research with these new technologies in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to start creating a developmental story and start understanding whether the things that we’re seeing are the root of autism or a neurological consequence of having had autism your whole life,” says McPartland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All autistic participants in the study had average or above average cognitive abilities. McPartland and collaborators are also working together on developing other approaches to PET scans that will enable them to include individuals with intellectual disabilities in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1767040196614"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What molecular difference did researchers find in autistic brains?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They discovered reduced availability of the mGlu5 glutamate receptor, which plays a central role in excitatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1767040198085"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does this receptor difference matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It supports the long-standing hypothesis that autism involves an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory brain signaling, which may explain a range of traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1767040197872"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Could this lead to new diagnostic or treatment approaches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Differences in excitatory neurotransmission have been identified in autism, but the molecular underpinnings are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the mechanism underlying these observed differences, the authors assessed glutamatergic receptor density in autistic adults using positron emission tomography (PET) and related it to a functional EEG measure of excitatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) availability was compared in autistic (N=16) and neurotypical (N=16) adults between 18 and 36 years of age, using the PET tracer 3-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl) benzonitrile ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FPEB). The PET outcome measure was volume of distribution (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) computed with equilibrium analysis using a venous input function and partial volume correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group differences were quantified using mixed-model analyses. Heterogeneity was further parsed within the autistic group by quantifying the relationship between receptor availability and the slope of the EEG power spectrum, an index of excitatory-inhibitory balance. Correlations between EEG and V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; were calculated using Spearman’s rho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all brain regions, mGlu5 availability was significantly lower (by ~15%) in autistic relative to neurotypical control participants. Group differences were generally greatest in the cerebral cortex. Within the autistic group, mGlu5 availability in all regions was significantly correlated with the slope of the EEG (e.g., cerebral cortex, r=0.67), such that shallower slope was associated with lower mGlu5 availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brain-wide investigation of mGlu5 availability with PET revealed pervasive lower mGlu5 availability across multiple brain areas in autism. Additionally, multimethod analyses revealed associations with a noninvasive electrophysiological index of excitatory neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that lower brain-wide mGlu5 availability may represent a molecular mechanism underlying altered excitatory neurotransmission that has the potential to stratify the heterogeneous autism phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:35:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFAwWHY1WWFMWmFFbktpc0JHLWc1cDYyYXFEUGU5S2cySzhFUms5b0RMM19XNjI5OWZONUY2T0puVWI4U3VITHVfZkExbTByakdCUmxDTklaaW9VcGVkVFpRMVQ0TzRKN1h2eUhKR0hR</guid></item><item><title>康特拉科斯塔县确诊麻疹病例-康特拉科斯塔健康</title><link>https://www.cchealth.org/Home/Components/News/News/979/415</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra Costa Health (CCH) is notifying the public of a confirmed case of measles in the county, identified on Dec. 24, 2025. The individual was contagious in public between Dec. 17 and Dec. 24, and people may have been exposed at the locations listed below.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Locations of potential measles exposure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dec. 17 or Dec. 19: Anthropologie, 1149 South Main St., Walnut Creek&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dec. 18: Macy’s, 1320 Broadway Plaza, Walnut Creek; ALO, 1292 Broadway Plaza, Suite 1106, Walnut Creek; Apple Store, 1200 South Main St., Walnut Creek&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dec. 21: STAT Med, 3799 Mount Diablo Blvd. #100, Lafayette &lt;br&gt;
    Dec. 23-24: Kaiser Permanente Walnut Creek Emergency Department, 1425 South Main St., Walnut Creek&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who were at these locations during the dates listed above may be at risk of developing measles, especially if unvaccinated, pregnant or immunocompromised. Measles can develop seven to 21 days after exposure. If you were at these locations during these times, you should confirm with your healthcare provider that you have been fully vaccinated against measles or have had measles infection in the past.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and call your healthcare provider immediately before seeking care so they are prepared to take care of you. Those who have been symptom free for more than 21 days after being exposed are no longer at risk for developing measles.   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A large majority of Contra Costa County residents are fully vaccinated against measles and have lifetime protection against infection. CCH encourages all eligible unvaccinated residents to get immunized against measles with two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to ensure their protection. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can linger in the air or on surfaces for over an hour after the contagious individual leaves an area. This makes it even easier to spread to those who do not have protection. Also, a person can spread the virus to others even before they develop symptoms.   Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that spreads over the body.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Although the risk of contracting measles is low for those who are fully vaccinated, members of the public should be aware of the situation and watch for symptoms.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
CCH is conducting contact tracing and notifying local healthcare providers to be vigilant for possible measles cases. CCH continues to monitor the situation and will provide updates if more information becomes available.  &lt;br&gt;

This year’s total is the nation’s highest since 1992, when officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020688.htm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 2,200 cases. Coordinated vaccination efforts led to a precipitous drop in cases in the ensuing decades, but vaccine skepticism in recent years has spawned the disease’s resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccine coverage dropping&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is very safe and effective,” the CDC said. “When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage &amp;gt;95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the confirmed patients this year, 26% have been younger than 5 years, 42% have been from 5 to 19 years, and 32% are older. Fully 93% have been unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Eleven percent of patients have required hospitalization, 20% of them preschoolers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is very safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials have confirmed 50 outbreaks, compared with 16 last year (and 285 cases).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three deaths have been confirmed to have been from measles in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outbreaks grow in Arizona, South Carolina&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Arizona and South Carolina updated their measles numbers last week. Arizona’s &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;total&lt;/a&gt; grew by five, to 195 infections. All the new cases are in Mohave County, which now has recorded 191 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohave County and the neighboring southwest region of Utah now have 292 cases, the second-largest US outbreak this year, after one in West Texas this past spring and summer. In August state officials &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/state-officials-declare-west-texas-measles-outbreak-over"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; the West Texas outbreak over after 762 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; has three new measles cases, bringing its 2025 total to 159, all of them since July 9. Of the total, 156 infections have been part of an Upstate outbreak centered around Spartanburg County that has involved many cases related to school exposures. All of the new cases are part of the Upstate outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a December 23 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ganSJVF1No"&gt;news briefing&lt;/a&gt;, State Epidemiologist Linda Bell, MD, said about 95% of measles patients in the state have been unvaccinated. She also said some exposures have been in healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, health officials in &lt;a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/nj-health-officials-warn-possible-measles-exposure-newark-airport"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; (Newark Liberty International Airport), &lt;a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/measles-boston-westborough-massachusetts-texas-visitor/69857705"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; (Logan), and &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/23/dia-potential-measles-exposure/"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; (Denver International) are alerting the public about potential measles exposures at airports that are linked to infected travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You'll be working relatively hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you have a higher V02 max. “Going up that set of stairs, you’re at 15–20 percent. It's easy for you,” King says. “[In the first scenario], everything you do in life is done at a higher percentage. But the higher you push your V02 max, the easier basically everything else you do in life is going to be. When you mow your lawn, when you play with your kids, when you go do all these things, if you have a larger tank and a larger capacity, everything is done at a lower percentage, thus making it that much easier for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing your V02 max frees up the mental capacity to focus on what matters most to you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While typically pigeon-holed as a physical fitness metric, V02 max could also play an important and holistic role in overall mental health, says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://im8health.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://im8health.com/"}' href="https://im8health.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IM8 ambassado&lt;/a&gt;r and performance coach to 2025 US Open winner Aryna Sabalenka Jason Stacy..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people are sitting in a sympathetic state a lot of the time, in this low-level stress, and that wears you out,” Stacy says “It can impact your ability to perform at your job, and it can impact your relationships with your family, friends, and loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[When you improve your V02 max], there's less stress on your overall system. And when there's less stress on your overall system, it's much easier for you to manage your emotions. It's much easier for you to step back and make better decisions and see things for how they are, rather than being caught up in all the day-to-day stresses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOSU4zV1dRQTNwNzF5WWwtblA3LXp2QXFOTmJZR2lKOVFMLVl2Qlc3Y2ljaWprQnFhU1JteFpIUUVsRmFZdEg5UkJ1ZzczemdGbS1kaGU5OFROdERobHQ0VkdaMm1PYUF1U3piTEl4TEhJQ002aVhjU3V2LThXbC05YzlKQ2RhSl9lNHZyX1VIY2dPMXFIak9kcnV3R2dtdzNhalNfczAtdmRwajg</guid></item><item><title>接种流感疫苗是否为时已晚？ “超级流感”在整个北卡罗来纳州蔓延的信息- Charlotte Observer</title><link>https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article314034720.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article314036264.html"&gt;flu cases&lt;/a&gt; have continued to rise across North Carolina, health experts have been urging residents to get vaccinated.

Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Is it too late to get a flu vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No&lt;/b&gt;, Weber told the Observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes &lt;b&gt;one to three weeks to build immunity&lt;/b&gt; after vaccination, and with North Carolina’s flu season not expected to peak until late January, Weber said there’s still time to get the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;NC flu vaccine rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS data show just &lt;b&gt;20%&lt;/b&gt; of North Carolina residents have been vaccinated against the flu during the 2025-26 season. Vaccination rates in Mecklenburg and Wake County are at 20% and 25%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those rates are lower than in previous years, Weber said, noting that most counties are usually around 30–50% vaccinated by this point in the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It depends obviously on age and risk factors,” Weber said, referring to vaccination rates. “It’s not surprising that older people who are at higher risk are more likely to be immunized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He attributed some of the drop to Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is “not a vaccine advocate,” he said. Kennedy’s tenure has included &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj.r389"&gt;&lt;u&gt;halting a CDC flu-promotion ad campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and pausing meetings of major vaccine advisory groups, moves public health experts say could undermine confidence and uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Growing hesitancy”&lt;/b&gt; hasn’t affected just the flu, Weber said, noting that vaccination rates for measles, rubella and pertussis (whooping cough) have also declined in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Where to get a flu vaccine in NC&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where to get a flu vaccine in NC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pharmacies&lt;/b&gt;: Walk in or schedule appointments at national pharmacies like &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/get-vaccinated"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CVS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/schedule-vaccine"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Walgreens&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

          &lt;p&gt;The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/"&gt;we have chips&lt;/a&gt; that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/scientists-built-an-ai-co-pilot-for-prosthetic-bionic-hands/"&gt;AI-based control software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Location via spikes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the recent work, based in China, decided to implement something similar for an artificial skin that could be used to cover a robotic hand. They limited sensing to pressure, but implemented other things the nervous system does, including figuring out the location of input and injuries, and using multiple layers of processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this started out by making a flexible polymer skin with embedded pressure sensors that were linked up to the rest of the system via conductive polymers. The next layer of the system converted the inputs from the pressure sensors to a series of activity spikes—short pulses of electrical current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four ways that these trains of spikes can convey information: the shape of an individual pulse, through their magnitude, through the length of the spike, and through the frequency of the spikes. Spike frequency is the most commonly used means of conveying information in biological systems, and the researchers use that to convey the pressure experienced by a sensor. The remaining forms of information are used to create something akin to a bar code that helps identify which sensor the reading came from.&lt;/p&gt;

but its use in practice has not been evaluated, according to the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"BMI is the standard measure for determining criteria for obesity. It's the most widely known metric," Dr. Erica Spatz, a cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the new study, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt; She noted that BMI alone does not account for adipose tissue, which stores energy, insulates organs and produces hormones that regulate appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Spatz said adipose tissue is less visible than other types of fat but "is more associated with high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the study, published in JAMA Network Open, the team used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national survey run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that measures the health and nutrition of adults and children in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team looked at data from more than 14,000 participants representing 237.7 million adults between 2017 and 2023, applying the Lancet Commission's proposed obesity criteria along with BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They found an estimated 75.2% of U.S. adults met criteria for obesity using BMI and additional body measurements compared to 40% when BMI alone was reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study, told ABC News that the findings provide a sense of how significant obesity is in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We do have a major problem. Obesity is by far the most significant chronic disease in human history," she said. "And this Lancet Commission really gives us a sense of how significant it is and how much we need to be doing a better job of treating it, make sure that we have the clinicians that are trained to identify not only obesity itself, but the over 230 chronic diseases associated with it and making sure that we have a healthier society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nearly four in 10 adults with a "normal" BMI were found to have excess body fat when waist-based measures were also applied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study also found that obesity prevalence increased sharply with age and was higher among Hispanic adults though rates were similar between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors noted that the study has limitations. And because nearly all adults age 50 and older were classified as having obesity under the new definition, age-specific thresholds are needed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors did highlight the limitations of BMI as a standalone screening tool and suggest that incorporating waist measurements could improve obesity detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They also stressed that because the new criteria will likely raise the current obesity estimates, more research should be done before broadly adopting the new definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ABC News' Dr.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Veronica Danquah &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Crystal Richards, MD, MS is a p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ediatric resident doctor at New-York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia University Medical Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:29:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNbnp5bGItSlZ6Tl9admdlMFljbmE1QUQ2UXdQUzltVXNsa3ZJVkxINGctcG1FSjExdnFDOER1YmxZV3lNbGRGenlIbHMtRUVUN2s5cUt1cHQ1UE95WUw5Y0d6c2dhRjZDdVppZHhjVllOSmVqNUVPWUJRMEhnMWVxUDV1a1kwUFpQYVdTUWlzZVNGdFI5LV9qQkVtNzBvemfSAaQBQVVfeXFMTVFzRWtXYVZVNW9yR1FOVFlkZEY0TVRvbGh3d1BtcEh6eElrUnN4NW1FeXM2OGYzdzJLNWxubDdCb01XM2Etdjh2eElDdF9HSGVjYWVyaTNhUUgxU2pQT0YwV0VJRktZTGN6cGpFZWN4SEh2amJwVUtSQTFXbmlGQkNyYzVMQ0tXR2hZYlJ3OXZtS3JhZGwyNVRxcjFZWjg4Q3IwbV8</guid></item><item><title>意见：治愈阿尔茨海默氏症的奇迹？不再是不可能。- MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-miracle-of-curing-alzheimers-no-longer-an-impossibility-e385925f</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQTk82RlE4X2V6VWhGaWRTZkg5TXJLeW9WRmhXaXlraDRnRUpDeXV6WU1TbUI1T2pPdW5ta3NsOFY4Z1gxNHdWWkpXejZmMG1RLU1mbmxHNkF1Y2twaFpfMHIwWHExYUlUOTJVbUhxQW91Y1I1a1daVGRNT29qQXktdEpMQWtLMUJ6OWFGTDVEYVlITC12TmN0NnRONTE0b1EyVGFEQQ</guid></item><item><title>50岁以后在家工作时可以缩小胃部突出的5种坐式练习-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/seated-exercises-shrink-stomach-overhang-work-from-home-after-50/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Sitting all day? Do these 5 quick seated moves to tighten your waist after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Look, I get it. You’ve been working from home, and that midsection isn’t cooperating like it used to. Here’s what’s really happening: as we age, we start &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8361073/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;losing muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;. And muscle is metabolically active, so when it goes, the body loses its ability to fight off fat the way it used to. Then you throw in working from home, sitting for hours, moving way less than you did when you had an office commute, snacking more because the kitchen is right there. Add in hormonal shifts, and suddenly that stomach overhang becomes this stubborn thing that won’t budge. But here’s the thing: you can actually start turning this around without leaving your chair. I’ve spent years helping people over 50 strengthen their core through &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://studiopilates.com" target="_blank"&gt;Studio Pilates International&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m going to show you five seated exercises that fit right into your workday. By the end of this, you’ll know exactly how to put them to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably already sitting. You don’t even need to go anywhere to begin exercising. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://mavmatrix.uta.edu/kinesiology_studentwork/80/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="Article"&gt;Exercising in the seated position&lt;/a&gt; can actually decrease the chances of adding in cheating movements, increasing the effectiveness of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall near the edge of your chair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gently draw your belly in (like zipping up snug pants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee, lower, then alternate sides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your torso still as your legs move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common mistakes:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t lean back, lift your shoulders, or hold your breath&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt; Training the arms increases the amount of muscle mass you can gain, increasing your metabolic rate and fat burning capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall with the arms straight, hands down next to the hips and holding onto small weights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the arms sideways to shoulder height, then slowly lower the arms back down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common mistakes:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t move your arms too quickly or shrug your shoulders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/b&gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt; Strengthens the lateral core and helps reduce side overhang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall with the arms straight, hands down next to the hips. One hand is holding a weight. The heavier, the better for this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gently bend to the side away from the weight, then straighten back up to sitting tall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common mistakes:&lt;/b&gt; Make sure you bend from the side of your waist, and don’t shrug your shoulders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/b&gt; 20 (10 each side)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt; Challenges the legs and will train the legs, adding more muscle to your frame&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit near the edge, feet firmly connected to the floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean ever so slightly forward and stand up completely. Try not to use your arms at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower yourself down back to your seat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common mistakes:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t use momentum or your arms to help yourself up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt; Works the arms but also requires great stabilisation through the core and upper back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall. Hold onto some small weights, with the hands in front of the shoulders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the arms directly overhead. Lower slowly back to the start position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your belly gently drawn in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common mistakes:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t tense your neck or arch your lower back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/b&gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Fit These Into Your Workday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aim for 4 to 5 sessions per week, even if each session is only 5 to 10 minutes. Because these are seated and low impact, it’s easy to add them between meetings, before answering emails, or anytime you feel yourself slouching. If you can squeeze in a session multiple times a day, this work will accumulate quickly and give the muscles a lot of stimulation throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat them as quick resets rather than full workouts. That mindset helps people stay consistent, which is what actually drives results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Results You Can Expect in 4 to 6 Weeks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these exercises won’t spot reduce fat, people usually notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flatter-looking midsection from improved posture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better activation of the deep core muscles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased stability and ease with daily movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced bloating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less lower back tension from stronger support through the trunk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1933658/meats-illegal-us-now/" target="_blank"&gt;Banning different kinds of meat is somewhat common in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., and it usually stems from two things: cultural norms or human safety. Mechanically separated meat definitely falls into the latter category, since chicken nuggets and various pork products are made via mechanical separation — meat goo, anyone? So &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1933658/meats-illegal-us-now/" target="_blank"&gt;why is mechanically separated beef banned&lt;/a&gt;? It all has to do with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE for short) — more commonly known as Mad Cow Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, BSE is caused by a prion, which is a misshapen protein in the brain that begins to clump together with other proteins, which in turn misshape those proteins. In cattle, the proteins can no longer function, and the animals die. This prion can actually pass from one organism to another, so it is possible for the misshapen prion to jump from cows to humans via meat consumption only (i&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/all-about-bse-mad-cow-disease" target="_blank"&gt;t is not contagious in the everyday sense&lt;/a&gt;), or by eating brain and spine tissue — if that's your thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, it's called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). It rapidly becomes a neurodegenerative disorder, often mimicking extreme forms of dementia. There are other types of vCJD, but they are uncommon. Since the disease could be contracted through meat, it quickly escalated into an international scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;Preventing BSE is a great thing, but the panic was wildly overstated&lt;/h2&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While BSE had been known since the late 1980s, it had mostly been centered on ranches and farms in the U.K. and seemed to be passed on when cows were fed discarded parts from other animals. By the early 2000s, Japan and the U.S. had cattle that tested positive for BSE. While infections still continue to this day, it is extremely rare for humans to get it. Only 143 people in Britain were diagnosed with vCJD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of many, especially today, the U.S. implemented several changes to how meat and cattle are regulated. The idea of the U.S. proactively regulating something seems like a bygone era. For example, cows that move across state lines have to be traceable for BSE. The ban on mechanically separated meat took effect in 2004, along with a ban on the &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/people-eating-brains-as-food-history-where-to-find-1849638067/" target="_blank"&gt;consumption of cow brains&lt;/a&gt;, tonsils, eyes, and spinal cords. This is all, arguably, a good thing. So then why would I claim it was way overblown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, only four cases of vCJD have been reported in the United States. Evidence suggests all four individuals were exposed abroad, with two cases likely linked to the U.K.Public concern created the impression that eating any beef could lead to brain degeneration. In reality, only four cases were confirmed among more than 300 million people in the United States. The widespread fear likely stemmed from the unsettling fact that a single misfolded protein could cause such severe neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

Conversely, social well-being was higher in younger and older adults, and lower in middle-aged adults. The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334787"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social well-being refers to the quality of a person’s relationships, sense of belonging, social support, and ability to function effectively within a community. It includes feeling accepted, valued, and connected to others, as well as having opportunities for meaningful social participation. Social well-being is supported by trust, reciprocity, social cohesion, and access to supportive networks. It also involves perceived fairness, inclusion, and the belief that society provides opportunities to meet basic needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social ill-being, in contrast, refers to conditions and experiences that undermine healthy social functioning and connectedness. It includes social isolation, loneliness, discrimination, marginalization, and chronic conflict. Social ill-being often arises from structural factors such as poverty, inequality, exclusionary institutions, or breakdowns in community trust. At the individual level, it may manifest as alienation, lack of support, or persistent interpersonal stress. Social ill-being can negatively affect mental and physical health, reducing resilience and increasing vulnerability to stress and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Jeffrey A. Hall and his colleagues wanted to explore how social well-being and ill-being vary with age. They also wanted to know what social circumstances, life changes, and attitudes about relationships are typical of individuals with different social well-being and ill-being levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from two groups of American adults recruited by the Siena College Research Institute (SCRI), a national leader in public opinion polling. These groups were surveyed in 2022 and 2023. The 2022 group included 2,034 participants, while the 2023 group included 2,243 individuals. In the latter part of each year, these samples were complemented by university students, including a random sample of those aged 18–21 and students over the age of 22. With the addition of the students, the total number of participants whose data were used in this analysis was 4,812.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the general population of the U.S., young adults were overrepresented and older adults were underrepresented in this group. The average age of participants was roughly 44 years. Approximately 57% were women, and 88% identified as heterosexual. Regarding relationship status, 31% were single, while 44% were married or cohabitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, social ill-being was assessed by aggregating measures of loneliness and social disconnection. Social well-being was assessed using measures of social connection, companionship, perceived social support, and the number of friends (derived from a naming task in which participants listed their friends). Participants who named at least one friend also answered a number of questions about their relationships with those friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that participants who reported higher levels of social well-being also reported less perceived stress and tended to have a higher number of friends. Individuals who reported higher levels of social ill-being tended to report lower levels of well-being and a somewhat lower number of friends. They were also more likely to report having lost touch with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older individuals tended to report lower levels of social ill-being (disconnection and loneliness). On the other hand, indicators of social well-being were highest for younger and older adults, while being lower for middle-aged adults. The number of friends was highest in emerging adulthood, declined during the late 20s, and reached its lowest point in middle age (45–60). It then gradually increased in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present manuscript suggests that loneliness among young adults is not bereft of connection, companionship, and friendship, but instead is characteristic of rapid life changes and a lack of relational permanence and routine,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of factors associated with social well-being. However, it should be noted that this was a cross-sectional, not a longitudinal study. This means that different ages were represented by different people, not the same people observed through their lifetimes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-may-help-reduce-pain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies suggest that vitamin D supplements may help reduce cancer pain and muscle pain, especially in people with low vitamin D levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Omega-3 has been found to stop pain from worsening.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taking vitamin D and omega-3 together can help prevent and manage chronic pain due to their inflammation-lowering effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 2022 study found that taking both supplements together reduced pain more effectively than taking either one alone.​&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all studies support the use of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D for pain reduction. A 2020 study observed that U.S. adults with chronic knee pain who took both omega-3 and vitamin D for more than five years did not see any significant decrease in pain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that taking about 1 gram of omega-3 per day may slow down biological aging by up to four months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, researchers have found that taking omega-3 and vitamin D together has even &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/supplements-for-longevity-8715067" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;greater benefits for biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Biological aging reflects the state of your organs and tissues and can predict your risk of diseases like Alzheimer's and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2025 study found that daily vitamin D supplementation of about 2,000 international units (IU) per day can reduce biological aging, with or without omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are considering taking supplements for this purpose, consider talking to your healthcare provider. Taking omega-3 or vitamin D might be more beneficial than taking both, especially if you have an underlying condition.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D helps reduce inflammation in the brain and may help enhance cognition and mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Omega-3 is also a brain food and can &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/supplements-for-brain-fog-8709220" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help boost cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, omega-3's inflammation-reducing properties may stabilize the nervous system and improve mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you live with depression or anxiety, talk to your healthcare provider, as supplements do not help treat the underlying cause of depression.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2021 study found that taking &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-vs-omega-3s-11691684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium and omega-3 together&lt;/a&gt; helped improve sleep quality in women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, there is not enough evidence to recommend taking omega-3 and vitamin D together to improve sleep quality. If you are concerned about your sleep quality, talk to your healthcare provider about supplement recommendations and other possible solutions.

                &lt;p&gt;We’re not ending 2025 without a last bit of awful news: Wildlife officials are sounding the alarm about a dangerous brain illness spreading among deer in North America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the last several weeks, officials in Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Manitoba, Canada, have reported cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in new areas. The mad cow-like illness can spread easily between deer and has a 100% fatality rate. In addition to its ecological impact, the infection may also pose a potential health threat to humans, particularly hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The zombie protein&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prions are perhaps the strangest pathogen around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re the misfolded form of a normally harmless protein found in the brain (also confusingly called the prion protein). When a rogue prion encounters its regular counterpart, it somehow forces the latter to misfold as well, almost like a zombie infection. Over time, this amassing army of bad prions will destroy the animal’s brain, leading to death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prion diseases have been found in many animals, humans included. The most infamous one might be bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-to-mad-cow-disease-history-prions-1851242160"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt;. Much like mad cow, deer and related cervids afflicted with CWD will experience neurological symptoms like confusion, trouble walking, and rapid weight loss (the titular wasting).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-wasting/animals/index.html"&gt;CWD&lt;/a&gt; was first discovered in the U.S. over 50 years ago, though it took longer for scientists to determine that prions are behind it. And it’s been spreading further across North America ever since. Cases have now been &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/distribution-chronic-wasting-disease-north-america-0"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in at least 36 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In mid-December, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission &lt;a href="https://www.agfc.com/news/cwd-positive-deer-found-in-grant-sevier-counties/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; three cases of CWD in hunter-harvested white-tailed deer. These cases were found in Grant and Sevier counties, where CWD had never previously been detected (the first ever case in Arkansas was reported in 2016). Last week, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources &lt;a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/newsroom/release/116586"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its first positive CWD test result of a deer in La Crosse County. That same week, the Manitoba Natural Resources and Indigenous Futures &lt;a href="https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=72097&amp;amp;posted=2025-12-22"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; five new cases of CWD, two of which were in previously undetected areas (the first CWD case in Manitoba was documented in 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why CWD matters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The increasing presence of CWD in North America is concerning for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CWD can be transmitted relatively easily, compared to other prion diseases like mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common, but still rare, prion disease that affects humans. CWD can spread directly through contact with infected animals and bodily fluids like saliva, and might also spread through prions left behind in the environment by urine or feces. That means CWD has the potential to cause sustained outbreaks of illness in both free-ranging and captive deer populations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s also the scary, if still only theoretical, danger of transmission to humans. Mad cow has sparked outbreaks of CJD in humans, caused by people eating contaminated beef. The possibility exists that a similar event could happen with hunters who eat CWD-tainted meat. Last year, for instance, a team of researchers &lt;a class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://gizmodo.com/chronic-wasting-disease-deer-meat-prions-hunter-deaths-1851423216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://gizmodo.com/chronic-wasting-disease-deer-meat-prions-hunter-deaths-1851423216" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; in a case report that two hunters who died from CJD may have been infected after consuming CWD-infected deer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cases have not been conclusively tied to CWD, and other scientists have been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prions-venison-deer-meat-brain-disease-mad-cow-guide-1851547274"&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; about the connection. Experimental studies have also provided mixed evidence for any transmission risk to people, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Still, CWD remains a real and growing threat to deer, as well as the human industries that rely on them. So even if CWD never directly harms us, it could cause a serious ecological disaster—large outbreaks could devastate local deer populations, which in turn would affect other species in the area, or cause the closure of deer farms, a $7.9 billion industry. To that end, Wisconsin officials have extended an existing baiting and feeding ban in La Crosse County (baits can attract large populations of deer to an area). Hunters, meanwhile, are advised against eating deer that are untested, or confirmed to have CWD.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular walking supports loss of visceral fat, a harmful type of fat linked to chronic disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether in the morning or evening, walking at any time of day can provide meaningful benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistency matters more than timing—choose a time you can stick with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all body fat is created equal. The fat hidden deep in your belly—known as visceral fat—is particularly important to understand. Unlike subcutaneous fat, the pinchable layer beneath your skin, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292293/9-things-you-shouldnt-do-if-youre-trying-to-trim-belly-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;visceral fat surrounds vital organs&lt;/a&gt; like the liver, stomach and intestines. Visceral fat is metabolically active, which means too much of it can pose serious risk to your health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of fat can affect hormone production, increase levels of inflammatory cytokines, fuel insulin imbalance and raise the risk of chronic diseases,” &lt;a href="https://www.functionalnutritionofcharleston.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Tomlin, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These potential health impacts make reducing visceral fat a priority to protect your long-term health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise is one of the most effective ways to reduce visceral fat, and it doesn’t require high-intensity workouts. Walking, in particular, is one of the most accessible and effective tools at your disposal. “Regular walking improves insulin sensitivity, lowers stress hormones and supports fat metabolism, making it an effective and sustainable way to reduce visceral fat over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Mascha-Davis/162939049" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But as you lace up your sneakers, you might find yourself wondering: Does the time of day matter? Is a sunrise stroll more effective than a sunset stride? We spoke with experts to find out whether there’s truly a “best” time to walk for visceral fat loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-there-a-best-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Is There a Best Time? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you look at the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lose-body-fat-8619424" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;science of fat loss&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to get caught up in timing “hacks” or secret tricks that promise faster results. But for walking and overall health, experts say we may be overcomplicating things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The most important factor in any exercise routine is your ability to stick with it long-term. If you force yourself to wake up at 4 a.m. for a walk but hate every minute of it, you likely won’t last a month. Likewise, if you plan to walk after work but are always too exhausted, that plan fails too. Therefore, the “perfect” time is largely subjective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tomlin puts the debate to rest quite clearly: “In short, no, there is no ‘best’ time to walk to reduce visceral fat. Consistency is more important than timing.” The cumulative effect of daily movement—regardless of when it happens—is what ultimately shifts the needle on visceral fat. The goal is to build a habit that fits naturally into your lifestyle so that you never have to rely solely on willpower to get out the door. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, if you’re curious, there are some subtle differences between walking in the morning versus later in the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-walking-in-the-morning"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Benefits of Walking in the Morning &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While consistency is king, there are unique benefits to getting your steps in early. For many people, a morning walk &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-health-experts-do-in-the-morning-11693714" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sets a positive tone for the day&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring your workout is done before daily distractions derail good intentions. This sense of accomplishment, plus the natural mood-boosting benefits of exercise, can start your day off on the right track.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning walks can also support metabolic health by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-blood-sugar-11681853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improving blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt; and enhancing metabolic flexibility—your body’s ability to efficiently switch between burning carbs and fat. In particular, getting in a morning walk before a busy workday, especially if it involves sitting at a desk, reduces sedentary hours. Research shows that even 30 minutes of light activity instead of sitting can improve metabolic flexibility and may support visceral fat loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for whether you should do this before or after you eat, the answer isn’t as clear. Some people enjoy walking before breakfast, or “fasted cardio,” while others prefer eating first. Currently, research shows overall benefits are similar either way, so the best approach is one you’ll actually do consistently.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, one often-overlooked perk of morning walks is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-boost-energy-8425516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exposure to early sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. Morning light helps to regulate your circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality, explains &lt;a href="https://www.wisebitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Poor sleep is linked to increased visceral fat, so getting outside early can have meaningful effects on both sleep and overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-exercising-in-the-afternoon-or-evening"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Benefits of Exercising in the Afternoon (or Evening) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t a morning person, don’t worry—&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/afternoon-habit-women-after-50-for-healthy-aging-11830800" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking later in the day&lt;/a&gt; comes with its own powerful benefits, especially for how your body handles food. After we eat, our blood sugar levels naturally rise, and walking shortly after a meal can help blunt this spike by encouraging your muscles to use that glucose for energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is particularly relevant after dinner, which is often the largest meal of the day. “Walking after meals, especially dinner, can be particularly helpful because it improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, which influence visceral fat storage,” says Davis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moving your body when blood sugar is elevated helps prevent excess insulin secretion, which can signal the body to store fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking later in the day can also make the habit easier to stick with, especially for those who rush in the mornings. For many, exercise after work can serve as a decompression tool to transition from “work mode” to “relax mode.” Not only can this help lower stress, but it can set the tone for a more restful evening and better sleep.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ready to tackle visceral fat with a daily walk? The key is to keep it simple and sustainable. Here are a few strategies to help you build a walking routine that lasts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Gradually&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are new to exercise, begin with just 10 to 15 minutes a day instead of jumping straight into an hourlong walk. This lets your muscles and joints adapt without causing soreness or injury. Gradually add a few minutes each week as your stamina improves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a Time That Works Best&lt;/strong&gt;. Look at your daily schedule and identify a window where you’re least likely to be interrupted or distracted. Whether it’s first thing in the morning, during your lunch break or after dinner, dedicating a specific time helps automate the habit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a Walking Buddy&lt;/strong&gt;. Pairing up with a friend, family member or neighbor can make the activity significantly more enjoyable and social. Having someone waiting for you creates a sense of accountability, making it much harder to skip your walk when you don’t feel like it. The conversation also makes the time pass quickly, turning exercise into a social outing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair It with Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’re walking solo, try listening to your favorite podcast, audiobook or an energetic music playlist while you move. This technique, often called “temptation bundling,” pairs something you enjoy with a healthy habit you want to build. It can make the walk feel like a reward rather than a chore.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track Your Progress&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider using a simple pedometer, a smartwatch or a journal to keep track of your daily steps or time spent walking. Seeing your numbers increase over time provides a tangible sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep going. It also helps you spot patterns in your routine so you can adjust as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit a Health Care Professional.&lt;/strong&gt; Before starting a new exercise routine, it’s important to run it by your health care provider, especially if you have any underlying conditions. They can also help design a walking plan that works best for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, winning the battle against visceral fat isn’t about stressing over the “perfect” time to walk. It’s about moving your body consistently and taking a holistic approach to your health. Whether you love the quiet calm of a morning stroll or the stress-busting benefits of an evening walk, the best time is simply the time you will actually do it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember that walking is just one piece of the puzzle. “Sleep, stress and nutrition all influence visceral fat, so walking works best as part of a bigger routine,” says Shah. By combining daily movement with adequate rest and a balanced diet, you create the best environment for your body to thrive.

&lt;p id="6bf0b261-17ac-453f-93ce-6876648cc97b"&gt;A vaccine that blocks the effects of fentanyl — including overdose — will enter human trials in the coming months, perhaps leading the way to the first-ever proactive treatment for opioid use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial trials will focus on assessing the safety of the vaccine, which was initially developed with funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. The shot was previously tested in rats and showed promising results. Now, it's been licensed by startup ARMR Sciences, which will begin enrolling patients for Phase I clinical trials in the Netherlands in 2026, starting in either January or February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="6bf0b261-17ac-453f-93ce-6876648cc97b-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;"Our goal as a company is to eliminate the lethality of the drug supply," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://armrsciences.com/team/collin-gage/" target="_blank" data-url="https://armrsciences.com/team/collin-gage/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colin Gage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and CEO of ARMR. "We want to go about doing that by attacking the root cause of not only addiction, but also, obviously, overdose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7f93948b-f826-43d3-b623-2950a67cae09" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-the-vaccine-work-3"&gt;How does the vaccine work? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="62420040-515d-48ad-a736-3c20d94ee969"&gt;The vaccine works by keeping fentanyl out of the brain, which it does by making the molecule a target of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with effects 50 times stronger than heroin. Opioids, also called narcotics, broadly work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, triggering changes in nerve cell signaling that prevent pain and can create a euphoric high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these opioid receptors are also found in the part of the brain that controls breathing, so fentanyl can also reduce respiration to a deadly degree if used in excess. A 2-milligram dose of fentanyl — similar in volume to about a dozen grains of salt — can be fatal, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Drug Enforcement Agency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DEA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person overdosing on fentanyl is treated with naloxone (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/fda-approves-over-the-counter-narcan-to-combat-opioid-overdose-crisis" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/fda-approves-over-the-counter-narcan-to-combat-opioid-overdose-crisis"&gt;&lt;u&gt;better known by the brand name Narcan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), quickly enough, these effects can be reversed. This antidote also binds to opioid receptors, thus blocking the effects of fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2S6keBAPTRuTtqvftSmoCc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2S6keBAPTRuTtqvftSmoCc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARMR's vaccine takes a different approach: It works in the circulatory system, before the drug can reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would be the first-ever treatment that does not work on the [opioid] receptor," Gage told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-05ef4b73-05f2-4f48-ab7f-5e81df80f844" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-s-in-the-vaccine-3"&gt;What's in the vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9978d089-b76f-45d1-afb5-5c3c21e8ada5"&gt;To keep fentanyl from reaching the brain, the immune system must first recognize the drug. But fentanyl is a tiny molecule, not a pathogen like a virus, and immune cells don't naturally react to its presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To spur an immune response to fentanyl, the University of Houston's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://armrsciences.com/team/dr-colin-haile/" target="_blank" data-url="https://armrsciences.com/team/dr-colin-haile/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colin Haile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ARMR co-founder and scientific adviser, and his colleagues had to tie the opioid to something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They chose a deactivated diphtheria toxin called CRM197, a compound already used in vaccines on the market; once deactivated, the toxin is no longer toxic and instead helps rouse an immune response. To boost this immune response even further, they also added dmLT, a compound distilled from toxins produced by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;bacterium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This modified compound is not toxic itself, and it has also been tested in humans in trials of other, not-yet-approved, vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two components are attached to a synthetic piece of the fentanyl molecule, which in and of itself cannot cause a high or pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the immune system meets this combo of fentanyl fragments, CRM197 and dmLT, it builds &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that react to real fentanyl. These antibodies bind to the opioid, keeping it from crossing the brain's protective membrane — the blood-brain barrier — and then clearing it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9694531/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9694531/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rat studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine blocked fentanyl from entering the rodents' brain and also blocked the drug from depressing respiration and causing overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ac61c6c6-a4d0-4994-a67a-662f6f8a9372" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-is-the-vaccine-being-tested-3"&gt;How is the vaccine being tested?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="15dce4e7-ce26-4188-8751-9a4f43638248"&gt;So far, the studies on the vaccine have been in rodents, though dmLT and CRM197 have respectively been tested to some extent and are already used in other vaccines in humans. The protocol in rats is to give an initial dose of the fentanyl vaccine and then boosters three and six weeks out from the first dose, Haile told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The longest we've followed the animals in our studies is about six months and we saw complete blockade of fentanyl effects at six months post the initial vaccination," Haile said. It remains to be seen how that will translate to "human years," he noted, but lab rats live a couple of years in total, so the researchers think the vaccine will work for a long time in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial human trials that will begin in early 2026 will enroll 40 people and will focus on detecting any safety issues with the vaccines, such as unwanted or dangerous side effects. Researchers will also draw blood samples from participants to make sure that the vaccine is spurring the creation of anti-fentanyl antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these Phase I trials are successful, the next step will be Phase II trials to test the vaccine's efficacy — how well the vaccine blocks fentanyl's effects. In these trials, not only will antibody levels be tracked over time, but some participants will also be dosed with safe levels of fentanyl used for pain relief in medical procedures. This will be done under close supervision, to check that the vaccine works in the presence of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="50b12702-95dd-483f-9583-6adcee5c5414"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The new vaccine is designed to block the effects of fentanyl, including overdose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-10add81a-802c-4f26-8f8d-4bedad5b3433" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-potential-drawbacks-to-the-vaccine-3"&gt;Are there potential drawbacks to the vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="fe2fd0c8-59c0-4c19-bfe2-1a95a140d62d"&gt;Fentanyl has legitimate medical uses as a painkiller, especially in emergency situations. One concern about the vaccine is that people who take it will lose this option for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the antibodies created by vaccination do not bind to other opioids — such as morphine, oxycodone or methadone — or to other pain-relief options, Haile said. That means there are alternatives if people who get the vaccine need pain relief down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug also does not interfere with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/buprenorphine" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/buprenorphine" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;buprenorphine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a drug used to treat opioid use disorder by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Haile said he and his team are currently testing the vaccine in combination with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/naltrexone" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/naltrexone" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naltrexone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a non-opioid medication also used to block the effects of opioids in treatment of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, it might be possible to take enough fentanyl to override the body's supply of anti-fentanyl antibodies, Haile said. However, given that the vaccine blocks fentanyl's euphoric effects, he expects people who want to quit will not be motivated to try to work around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want people who want to quit, want to not use the drug," he said. "That will give them a chance to realize that they won’t get high from this drug and there is no use in taking it any longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-fe6ea8e1-3a66-4019-841c-4fdba71ce53a" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-might-benefit-from-the-fentanyl-vaccine-3"&gt;Who might benefit from the fentanyl vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="bfff0d10-f94f-47ed-824a-dc7a77a1f7c2"&gt;Gage suggested that one market for the vaccine could be first responders concerned about accidental fentanyl exposure. (That &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395921002061" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395921002061" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;concern has risen in recent years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492952/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492952/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with the spread of misinformation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about fentanyl.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clarity: if fentanyl gets on your skin via casual exposure — for example, if you touch an object that's been exposed to the drug — it will not absorb through the skin. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/opioids/fentanyl-exposure-public-places" target="_blank" data-url="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/opioids/fentanyl-exposure-public-places" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meaningful absorption through the skin requires direct contact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the drug over hours or days. That said, if an EMT or police officer gets the drug on their hands and then touches their mouth or eyes, they could feel some of the drug's analgesic, or pain-relieving, effects, Haile said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine could also be "an extra tool in the toolset" for people with opioid use disorder, Gage said. Combining the vaccine with "robust" &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a type of talk therapy, and communal support could be "incredibly beneficial to people who are just looking for another lifeline to help themselves get better," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="0db7a398-1817-4469-b3a9-733e9f02a58b"&gt;Finally, the vaccine could be beneficial for people who use less-deadly drugs — such as cocaine, stimulants or painkillers — that they buy on the black market. That's because these drugs &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/fentanyl-overdose-death-rates-more-than-tripled-in-recent-years-cdc-report-shows" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/fentanyl-overdose-death-rates-more-than-tripled-in-recent-years-cdc-report-shows"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are increasingly cut with fentanyl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning people may overdose without even knowing they are taking the opioid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had two close childhood friends who passed away from fentanyl overdose," Gage said. "Neither of them were seeking it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Over 48,000 people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to have died of opioid overdoses in 2024 in the U.S., according to provisional data. Perhaps due to this high death toll, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/Supplement_1/S98/6586840" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/Supplement_1/S98/6586840" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early research suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that people with personal experience with opioid use disorder and the general public alike view a possible anti-fentanyl vaccine positively. Time will tell how the new vaccine will perform in human trials, but if eventually approved, it could be a first-of-its-kind tool against overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="d9b3f4c9-cd5c-44d2-8e58-9b3cd0c3c9a4"&gt;

One such virus is called &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/hepatitis-a" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Hepatitis A"&gt;Hepatitis A&lt;/a&gt;, which many of us are aware of. There are many types of viruses, but Hepatitis A spreads through contaminated food and water, affecting your gut and causing jaundice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She further emphasised the risks for children, adding, “In children, this virus can present as acute liver failure or progressive jaundice.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Precautions to take before eating street food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sehrawat advises everyone to exercise caution when it comes to street food. “First and foremost, avoid street food because it’s usually contaminated food and water. If you notice &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/bloating-cramps-or-irregular-digestion-yoga-expert-recommends-7-yoga-poses-to-calm-ibs-symptoms-and-improve-gut-health-101766958657746.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like loose stools, fever, yellowing of the eyes, or yellowing of the urine, you should immediately consult a doctor. That’s why I always say, be cautious before eating gol gappa.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Her advice serves as an important reminder, especially during festive seasons or outdoor gatherings, that hygiene and food safety should never be compromised for the sake of taste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The stew is packed with green vegetables, whole grains, olive oil and legumes, which help with inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within 15 minutes, you can prep the ingredients and set the slow cooker for an easy dinner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a flavorful, kid-friendly dish that cooks on its own, providing for more family time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a dad who's the primary cook in the household, I'm always searching for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18049/healthy-kids/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy kid-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt; my young daughters will enjoy. Sure, I love to cook for my family, and it's exciting when my girls get to try new ingredients, flavors and textures, but more than anything, I want them to actually &lt;em&gt;eat &lt;/em&gt;their dinner. So when I tested this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275095/slow-cooker-vegetable-stew/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Slow-Cooker Vegetable Stew&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;Test Kitchen, I knew I had found a winner. Plus, it has plenty of ingredients that can help with inflammation, but more on that later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-this-slow-cooker-recipe-won-me-over"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How This Slow Cooker Recipe Won Me Over &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before I had kids, my slow cooker collected dust, hidden deep inside a cabinet with other unused gadgets and appliances. I'd bring it out only for special occasions—for example, when hosting a holiday party, I'd keep hot drinks warm in the slow cooker (this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248172/hot-cider-with-apple-brandy-spices/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hot Cider with Apple Brandy &amp;amp; Spices&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorites). But now with a serious lack of extra time in the day, I've learned to truly appreciate my slow cooker. I now lean hard into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17987/cooking-methods-styles/slow-cooker-crockpot/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow-cooker recipes&lt;/a&gt;, and this veggie stew is my favorite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is one of those recipes that caught me off guard the first time it made its rounds through the test kitchen. Over the years, I've tested many, many slow-cooker recipes, and I can't say any really caught my attention. I admit, for a long time, I turned my nose up at slow-cooker recipes as they are often flat in the flavor and texture department. But there was something about the simplicity of this veggie-packed stew and its delightful, lively flavors that inspired me to make it over and over again for my family.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It starts quite simply with a couple of cans of whole plum tomatoes I crush by hand, then comes a can of drained and rinsed cannellini beans, potatoes and aromatics. The recipe also calls for Italian (Romano) beans, which are long, flat green beans. You can find them in the well-stocked freezer section of a grocery store, or substitute chopped fresh green beans or frozen cut green beans if Romano beans are unavailable. I'll also often add whatever vegetables I have on hand, like frozen corn or edamame, leftover sautéed zucchini or roasted bell peppers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The ingredients in the stew are not only tasty, but many are also part of an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290509/the-anti-inflammatory-diet-is-it-right-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt;, which may help fight chronic inflammation associated with many diseases. The olive oil, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044322/are-potatoes-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, tomatoes, garlic and cannellini beans all have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;, which I truly appreciate for my overall gut health and general well-being. I never had a doctor tell me to eat any specific diet for my nagging health issues, but for about the last decade I've adopted a mostly plant-based diet with lots of leafy green veggies, whole grains, olive oil and legumes. Eating these foods makes me feel lighter, less stiff and less achy. Plus I have more energy compared to when I eat more processed, higher fat foods.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what makes this veggie stew so special compared to the countless other slow-cooker recipes out there? Of course, I love those chunky vegetables and the gentle oregano flavor, but the stew really shines from the finish of sautéed garlic. Just before serving, I heat some extra-virgin olive oil in a small skillet and add lots of minced garlic. I cook it until it's golden brown and fragrant, and stir the garlic and oil into the stew. This not only adds richness to the stew but tons of toasty garlic flavor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I serve the stew with simple garlicky croutons that my daughters &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; using to sop up the tomatoey broth. Sometimes I'll stir in leftover homemade pesto or even drizzle it with some crushed Calabrian chiles in oil (drizzled into my bowl as I'm the only one who enjoys spice).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I can prep this recipe in the morning in about 10 to 15 minutes, set the slow cooker to low, and it'll be ready for us to enjoy at dinner. This gives me more time to spend with my girls after school rather than focusing on making them dinner. And with time being the most precious resource as a parent, delicious and healthy make-ahead recipes like this stew are a godsend. And it doesn't hurt to have a recipe I know the whole family will enjoy.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The powerful drugs — taken by millions — have long been known to potentially trigger symptoms including dizziness, headaches, insomnia and nausea when coming off them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, there are no real guidelines: When medication is stopped, there is no follow up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To assess the health impact of overprescribing, experts from the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health and Service Evaluation, cross-examined over 75 studies to work out the best way for a patient to come off the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysing medical records from over 17,000 individuals, the researchers found the most effective method is gradually lowering the dosage alongside seeing a therapist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the researchers, this could help prevent relapse in one in five patients, helping dramatically reduce the number of patients unable to get off of antidepressants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were followed for around a year, with those who abruptly stopped taking their medication found to be at a 40 per cent risk of relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who gradually came off antidepressants, whilst seeing a psychiatrist, however reduced their risk of relapse by nearly 50 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, the study found, was almost as effective as continued drug usage without psychological support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that guidelines on coming off antidepressants should 'promote individualised deprescribing with gradual tapering and structured psychological support.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Giovanni Ostuzzi, study co-author also from the University of Verona, added: 'Continuing with or without psychological support, slow tapering with the psychological support and continuing at the antidepressant at reduced doses had similar benefits in preventing relapse within the first year after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Abrupt stopping or fast tapering carried the highest risk of relapse.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope that their study will pave the way for more personalised prescribing practices and help more patients come off the drugs sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our new review clarifies the scientific evidence about the most effective way to come off antidepressants for individuals successfully treated for depression and could change how coming off antidepressants is managed globally,' Prof Oztuzzi added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the need for clinical guidelines to be updated to promote regular treatment reviews and individualised deprescribing with gradual tapering and structured psychological support for patients with depression who are feeling better and wish to come off their medication.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, experts who were not involved in the current study have expressed concern over patients coming off medication too quickly, without the support of their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jonathan Henssler, MD, an expert in evidence-based mental health, stressed: 'The best patient outcomes were achieved with strategies that maintained antidepressant therapy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that currently both pharmaceutical treatment and psychotherapy are limited in their curative capacity- meaning that for effective usage, both need to be used in adjunct, which is not always feasible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-5e8755b0-e4b0-11f0-b285-a1098cd4136c" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15419207/come-antidepressants-avoid-effects.html"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What are antidepressants? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are around 30 different types that can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says that most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants. But it notes that this isn't the case for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects vary between different people and antidepressants but can include nausea, headaches, a dry mouth and problems having sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antidepressants aren't addictive but patients may have withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include an upset stomach, flu-like symptoms, anxiety, dizziness and vivid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts highlighted the the follow-up period of the study was relatively short, meaning it is difficult to make long-term conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Alberto Oritz Lobo, a leading psychiatrist at La Paz University, welcomed the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'This is a crucial study given the alarming increase in antidepressant prescriptions and the need to consider strategies for reducing their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The usual clinical reality is that, after people improve, antidepressant treatment is often continued for months, years, or indefinitely, leading to chronic adverse effects of the medication, exposure to its risks, and brain neuroadaptation that makes stopping the medication difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that gradually reducing the dose helps support changes in the brain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Continuing, he said: 'Psychological support provides confidence and security in this process, in which the person regains their agency and autonomy, reappropriates their emotions and stops delegating their well-being to a medication.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latest NHS data shows a record 8.8million people in England are now on the mood-boosting drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common SSRIs prescribed in the UK include citalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline, sometimes known by brand names Cipramil, Prozac and Lustral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their use has been linked to long-term and even permanent sexual dysfunction by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS has warned that side effects such as a loss of libido and achieving orgasm, lower sperm count and erectile dysfunction 'can persist' after taking them — and patients have described feeling 'carved out', relationships wrecked, from their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most medics, and the NHS, consider the use of SSRI for depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, as worthwhile given the debilitating nature of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:09:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxObHIyODlrMk5zdUd3ZEpnYW93LTYxdTNJaVU2cTNLSWw0WHVnQVk2T05McDNwWVl0TU5QWnR2WjJXZHZYb3FKQW9qakZHTDBvZ3p1ek5BclpvTjhuZ2xGSE5iQXA2RmdSdU90N05PdGg2cDdmaXZDN3BMYllyT2ZFUjFFRXp2VkZJVHVRNTVhRlZDT3lnOWfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTXZfTFdkQ080dnJmNm5vVk1PZGUyVldJbnRxN0dBMHdUaVdiMlFSUE9kM0FfUEJncEhuaXNOU2RRdjZKZUYzbjkyMVJZd2duM09fMDBSc0xzS3BFNW1kekp4NktaOGpLY0ljWHIwVHlrbGxheDJUUHRjaHg1VGw1Y0pMUEMtX2J0NE9CcXR5Y19sMFY3ZlJGaGFZX3c</guid></item><item><title>想在2026年改善您的健康状况吗？简明扼要-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/wellness-influencers-politics-fiber-protein-longevity-9969ef29b9cf29fe5fded67637351c7c</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;The new year is a time when many try to start new good habits and commit to improving health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But resolutions, lofty as they may be, can turn daunting quickly with all the advice and sometimes contradicting information coming at you from news reports, advertisers, influencers, friends and even politicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they don’t have to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, The Associated Press got the downlow on all manner of health and wellness claims and fads. The good news is that the experts mostly say to keep it simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 2026 arrives, here’s what you can skip, what you should pay attention to and how to get credible information when you are inevitably faced with more confusing claims next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein and fiber are important, but you probably don’t need to pay more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your diet, experts say most people can skip the upcharge. If you’re eating enough, you’re &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/high-protein-muscle-food-nutrition-e3bd1ddb197139bdf7fe67a09fcdf32e"&gt;probably getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and don’t need products that promise some big boost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s true that most people could use more fiber in their diets. But, please, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fiber-fibermaxxing-digestion-wellness-730bdd5f68f448fe979f4ebd598e2340"&gt;ditch the “fiber-maxxing” trend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Instead, eat whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;A good skin care routine is not expensive or complicated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 20-step skin care routine and $200 serum some TikToker sold you on? &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/skin-care-retinol-red-light-therapy-beef-tallow-16ce2a56462995c41054fdf147814d7e"&gt;Dermatologists say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you really don’t need it. Stay away from the beef tallow and slather on a good sunscreen instead (yes, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sunscreen-for-dark-skin-tones-cccd4a0c1cea4e4a5ca6a67c00a5b5c5"&gt;even if you have darker skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the same rule for simplicity applies to that hourlong “everything shower.” The best showers are simple and short, dermatologists say, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/shower-basics-tiktok-social-media-dermatologist-8a96743d7b86c329703f7736a7306961"&gt;no “double cleansing” required&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

&lt;h2&gt;There are many simple ways to get that workout in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the gym and all its equipment feel intimidating, you can drop the illusion that a good workout requires either. This year, the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/calisthenics-exercises-fitness-body-weight-c9f2f9c44c36a3078f5ffeb744c094d2"&gt;comeback of calisthenics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put the focus back on no frills, bodyweight workouts you can do in the comfort of home. Research shows calisthenics helps with muscle strength and aerobic conditioning. You may eventually need weightlifting or other equipment, but it is a great place to start to build consistency and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Be wary of wellness fads and treatments — they are often too good to be true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you imbibe too much this New Year’s Eve, doctors say you can do without “ &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/retail-iv-therapy-drip-hydration-e335f09bc013739aa69fa43d92bc4945"&gt;IV therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” which have vitamins you can get more easily and cheaper in pill form — if you even need more, which is unlikely if you have a balanced diet. You’re pretty much just paying for “expensive urine,” one doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same for “wellness” focused products like &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gut-health-test-microbiome-probiotics-diet-f61947edfc591616639253eeb7a8c3e0"&gt;microbiome testing kits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that generate information that doctors can’t actually act on. And if you don’t have diabetes, there’s scant evidence that you need &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/continuous-glucose-monitor-cgm-diabetes-75469f79bc649cab0d831e6ec52758a7"&gt;a continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;To improve your health, go back to the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a panacea pill, product or routine can be enticing. But science already knows a lot about how to improve mental and physical health, and they are tried and true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lifestyle changes don’t just make you feel better in the moment.

Start with your doctor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tough to know who to listen to about your health, faced with compelling personal stories on social media from people who swear something worked from them, or clever marketing and advertising from companies that scare you or promise an easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubts have been raised this year about established medicine, including the safety of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/synthetic-dyes-red-3-artificial-colors-ef5af10b3aca66d0033d3f239546f1aa"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fluoride-treatment-dental-teeth-78371f76118a1c7b8bf954d19b641d26"&gt;fluoride dental treatments,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-acip-a6032868d6025e2c527c574222fcabf3"&gt;hepatitis B shot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for newborns, and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hormone-therapy-estrogen-hot-flashes-fda-5b1f29a73553c142f67b1f88b6656428"&gt;hormone therapies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the medical system is not perfect, your doctor remains the best person to talk to about prevention, health concerns and potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t get to a human doctor and turn to Dr. Google instead, be sure to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-internet-medical-advice-9d4c56da3e598e694b2cf99b4eb5b71b"&gt;follow these tips and never use it to diagnose yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflammation risk can go up in the winter, and what you eat is important to keep it in check. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing colorful fruits help reduce inflammation and deliver other key nutrients. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These fruits, including grapefruit and kiwi, are in season during the winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The secret to feeling your best this January could be lurking in the produce aisle. According to &lt;a href="https://www.mynutritionandme.com/about-us#meet-the-dietitian" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karolin Saweres, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, “​​Low-grade inflammation often increases during winter due to reduced sunlight exposure, changes in activity levels, higher stress and shifts toward more energy-dense, lower-fiber diets.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;While inflammation is a natural immune response, chronic &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-grade inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can zap your energy levels and make it harder for your body to fight off seasonal bugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If staying energized through dark winter days and dodging more cold and flu germs than you catch is high on your priority list, you’re in luck. Many winter fruits are rich in polyphenols, vitamin C and other antioxidants to support the immune system and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/antioxidant-rich-fruits-for-inflammation-11794100" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, explains Saweres, while also “supporting gut microbial diversity and intestinal barrier function, both of which play a central role in regulating systemic inflammation.” Whether you’re looking to support your body through sick season or simply want to feel your best as you ease into the new year, here are five seasonal anti-inflammatory fruits dietitians recommend enjoying this winter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-kiwi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Kiwi &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eat your greens” usually refers to vegetables, but a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kiwi will do the trick&lt;/a&gt; if you’re eating to manage inflammation. “One medium kiwi provides roughly 7% of your recommended Daily Value for vitamin E, which helps slow the production of molecules that promote inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://elizabethharrisnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elizabeth Harris, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to vitamin E, you’ll also find a good amount of vitamin C in just one kiwifruit. This antioxidant supports immune health, protects the body from oxidative stress and helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;regulate the inflammatory response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While snacking on plain kiwi (even the skin!) is perfectly acceptable, you can slice it up over granola and yogurt for breakfast or make a simple fruit salad. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-grapefruit"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Grapefruit &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grapefruits don’t have the weight-loss superpower that was once believed (anyone remember the grapefruit diet?), but they are an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-grapefruit-8783128" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incredibly nutritious fruit&lt;/a&gt;, supporting your health in a number of ways. “Grapefruit is packed with vitamin C and flavonoids that support anti-inflammatory pathways, insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bess Berger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have even found evidence that regularly consuming grapefruit may help regulate gene expression involved in inflammation, resulting in enhanced cardioprotective benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berger recommends tossing the segments with a simple green salad dressed with olive oil and cracked pepper for a nourishing and refreshing side. Just be sure to check if grapefruit interacts with any medications you may be taking before adding it to the grocery list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-persimmons"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Persimmons &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to an apricot, with a honey-like flavor, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-eat-persimmons-8724541" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;persimmons&lt;/a&gt; can add sweetness to salads and color to yogurt bowls, or can be simply eaten on their own. With a bright orange hue, they’re rich in carotenoids, helping protect the body against heart disease, neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancers through their influence on the immune system and regulation of inflammatory compounds in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to their high antioxidant content, persimmons are rich in fiber, with 6 grams per small fruit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The fiber in persimmons has been shown to support beneficial gut bacteria and help dial down inflammatory signals,” says &lt;a href="https://peaceandpancakes.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Talia Follador, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Enjoying a sliced persimmon with probiotic-packed yogurt is an excellent way to support a diverse microbiome while keeping inflammation in check. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-oranges"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Oranges &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stocking up on juicy, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-oranges-11680294" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet oranges&lt;/a&gt; brightens up the frozen months of January and February. Not only are they so much more flavorful than at other times of year, but they’re loaded with the immune-supporting nutrients our bodies need. “Oranges are rich in vitamin C and citrus flavonoids—especially hesperidin and naringenin—which help regulate inflammatory pathways and reduce oxidative stress,” says Follador.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while a glass of orange juice will provide many vitamins and flavonoids that support your immune system and reduce inflammation, snacking on whole oranges provides even more benefit. Researchers have found that the fiber and polyphenols in whole fruits further reduce inflammation and exert a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prebiotic effect in the gut&lt;/a&gt;, producing short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy oranges plain, blend them in a smoothie, or eat them in a bright and fresh &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249105/orange-avocado-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;orange and avocado salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The effort of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-prep-and-eat-a-pomegranate-8719579" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;opening a pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; is well worth it when you consider how nutritious (and delicious) those little juicy arils are. “Pomegranate contains powerful polyphenols, particularly punicalagins and anthocyanins, which play a role in lowering inflammation and supporting heart health,” says Berger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several studies have found that the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;effects of pomegranates go beyond heart health&lt;/a&gt;, supporting symptom reduction from menopausal hormonal changes and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berger recommends sprinkling pomegranate arils over roasted squash or sweet potatoes for a beautiful and flavorful contrast. And if the daunting task of peeling pomegranates is preventing you from enjoying them more often, buying them pre-peeled and frozen is a handy solution. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The cold winter months don’t have to leave you feeling sluggish or run-down. January seasonal fruits like kiwi, grapefruit, persimmons, oranges and pomegranates are full of antioxidants, fiber and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7935097/best-anti-inflammatory-foods-to-eat-this-winter/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory compounds&lt;/a&gt; that support immunity, gut health and overall wellness. Building these fruits into your weekly routine is a simple and tasty way to support your health and feel your best during the coldest months of the year.
