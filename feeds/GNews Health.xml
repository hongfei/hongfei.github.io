If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Creatine is finally garnering the recognition it deserves. After years of being regarded as a bulking supplement used exclusively by gym bros and bodybuilders (my mom, one of the latter, has been taking it daily for years), those focused on muscle mass are finally incorporating the naturally occurring substance into their everyday supplement regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;â€œWhile itâ€™s true that historically, creatineâ€™s primary use was as an athletic or bodybuilding supplement, research is now showing that it can profoundly impact the brain and neurological health,â€� says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/myersdetox/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.instagram.com/myersdetox/?hl=en"&gt;Dr. Wendy Myers, MD&lt;/a&gt;. â€œStudies show that creatine improves energy metabolism in the brain, which can have several positive downstream effects, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38297476/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38297476/"&gt;protecting against neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, improving focus, enhancing memory, and supporting overall mental stamina.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Muscle is having a momentâ€”thanks to its ties to longevity and metabolismâ€”but creatineâ€™s rep hasnâ€™t fully caught up. While its muscle-building benefits still lead the charge, skepticism lingers, especially among women who equate it with bulking. But, according to experts, creatine may even be more important for women than for men. â€œCreatine has a long-standing reputation as a supplement for bodybuilders, but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33800439/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33800439/"&gt;new research &lt;/a&gt;shows it could be one of the most important tools for women navigating perimenopause, menopause, and postpartum recovery,â€� Dr. Meyers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="conversion-card conversion-card-extended"&gt;&lt;p class="conversion-card__description"&gt;In addition to five grams of creatine monohydrate, Arraeâ€™s Tone Gummies also contain the brandâ€™s proprietary Slimbiotics blend and ginger extract, which helps support the gut while combatting bloat, aiding digestion, and further supporting your body composition goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sadly, most creatine supplements on the market come in the form of chalky, bitter powders you have to chug to get down, which is kind of a dealbreakerâ€”especially if youâ€™re already on the fence about incorporating it into your ever-expanding supplement lineup (I get it). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Before I discovered &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies"&gt;Arraeâ€™s Tone Gummies&lt;/a&gt;, I was adding my creatine powder to water and taking it down like a shot. Iâ€™ve been a fan of Arrae for years (especially of its weight-management, GLP-1-like &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1"&gt;MB-1 metabolic supplement&lt;/a&gt;), so itâ€™s not a shock that I have the Tone Gummies on an automatically recurring subscription plan now. Each serving contains five milligrams of creatine monohydrate (based on my research, the gold standard creatine type and dose) and has a berry-like flavor. It almost tastes like a berry-flavored powdered sugar gummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies"&gt;Arraeâ€™s Tone Gummies&lt;/a&gt; are formulated specifically for women to promote lean muscle mass, enhance post-workout recovery, and aid digestion. Along with five milligrams of creatine monohydrate, these gummies also contain gut-nourishing ginger and a postbiotic to combat bloating, foster regularity, and prevent any unwanted â€œbulking.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt; I used to dread my daily creatine dose, and now I actually look forward to it. Plus, as someone who travels at least once a month, the fact that Iâ€™m not transporting suspicious white powder in a random vessel or plastic bag through the TSA is a major selling point for these gummies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If youâ€™re looking for a clean protein supplement that doesnâ€™t require consuming excess sugar, meat, and calories, Arraeâ€™s new &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fclear-protein" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fclear-protein"&gt;Clear Protein+&lt;/a&gt; is worth adding to cart as well. Each packet is formulated with 15 grams of grass-fed whey and collagen protein, as well as electrolytes, and for just 70 calories per serving. Think your standard electrolyte packet, but without the excess sugar, chemicals, and saccharine taste. Add these two muscle-supporting supplements to my ride-or-die &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1"&gt;â€œfaux-zempicâ€� MB1&lt;/a&gt; and youâ€™ve got the ultimate body-composition-boosting trio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="b-article-body__h2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORE FROM SCOUTED:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 17:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5SUkViREh5R2ZpcDR2dU56V1RjQTVDVUxHLXlOTm9lNklVQmU3Q1NDNHNQRjZWMl9oUzhlWXN4UEtnMmNKSGFXWFBVQVNTSTVZSzJ3U0lpTXVyR2lKTmFIa3hkR2JfUEdneGJ5LXprdmQtRTA</guid></item><item><title>如果您想在60天内看起来和感觉更年轻，请告别这7个习惯- VegOut | If you want to look and feel younger in 60 days, say goodbye to these 7 habits - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPZER2SFpzY0VRRDVqNXd1d2hBOFl0TVlRSmFmQ2o1NUpINXZzMGlrMkJoT2tUaVFpdlRpN0lsN1ktWGl5RmFOc2Vwd3UxdlY3eTY5Z2tTYWQ3M09PRXFrN0wtM3dVRFhzbXBzN1dTZi16T3JUb052LVFxTDZFY2JwNjItUVA3djZtQm80V1VVOUVScVNYb2NoeE55ci1WUUhyOThLNzdXM1FXdFpxMjIxUV80LUU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1135"&gt;Sixty days ago, I hit what I call a “high-definition moment.” I’d just climbed three flights of office stairs, latte in hand, and caught my reflection: puffy eyes, sallow skin, shoulders slumped like a crooked coat hanger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1135"&gt;My spreadsheet brain kicked in—if the numbers don’t add up, change the inputs. That afternoon I drafted a personal experiment: for two months I would prune the daily habits scientists link to accelerated aging and replace them with low-friction alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1135"&gt;The payoff was remarkable: deeper sleep, steadier mood, a brighter complexion, and enough energy to skip the 3 p.m. coffee. Here’s the seven-item checklist that made the difference—and how each swap works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1142" data-end="1167"&gt;1. Skimping on sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1169" data-end="1601"&gt;We treat sleep like an optional software update, clicking “remind me tomorrow” until the system crashes. Trouble is, the hard drive (your DNA) keeps score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1169" data-end="1601"&gt;A 2024 &lt;em data-start="1332" data-end="1340"&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study showed that chronic insomnia speeds up the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-84957-1?.com"&gt;GrimAge epigenetic clock&lt;/a&gt;, a blood-based marker that predicts mortality risk; put simply, six-hour nights can make your cells behave years older than the calendar says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1603" data-end="2176"&gt;To nudge my bedtime earlier, I scheduled “lights-out meetings” in my calendar at 10 p.m.—no agenda, just a recurring commitment. The ritual felt silly for a week, but the visual block stiff-armed late-night emails and streaming rabbit holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1603" data-end="2176"&gt;Within three weeks my resting heart rate dropped, and the gray half-moons under my eyes looked like they’d been erased with concealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1603" data-end="2176"&gt;For anyone skeptical, do the math: banking 56–60 hours of shut-eye per week equals eight full nights of cellular repair every 30 days. That’s compound interest you can literally see in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2183" data-end="2218"&gt;2. Living the chair-bound life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2220" data-end="2629"&gt;Most of us sit longer than our phones charge. A systematic review of 48 studies found that regular exercise preserves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8879766/?.com"&gt;telomere length&lt;/a&gt;—the protective caps on DNA that fray with age—while inactivity lets them shrink faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2220" data-end="2629"&gt;Telomeres are like the plastic tips on shoelaces; once they wear down, the lace unravels. Daily movement, even short bouts, slows that fraying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2631" data-end="3170"&gt;In practice, I turned every conference call into a roaming meeting. Headset on, I paced a looping circuit from desk to kitchen, adding roughly 4,000 steps without reshuffling my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2631" data-end="3170"&gt;Bonus: walking activated my “idea engine”—the best line items in my quarterly budget presentation were drafted mid-stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2631" data-end="3170"&gt;If treadmills bore you, pair routines: brew morning coffee while doing calf raises, stream your favorite show only if you stretch through the first act, or meet a friend for a brisk “walk-and-talk” instead of sitting over fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3177" data-end="3212"&gt;3. Sipping sugar by the bottle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3214" data-end="3684"&gt;Yes, that “innocent” craft cola counts. Harvard researchers tracking 15,000 adults with type 2 diabetes found that each additional sugar-sweetened beverage raised the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/04/sugary-drinks-raise-risk-of-premature-death-in-people-with-type-2-diabetes/?.com"&gt;risk of cardiovascular death by 8 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3214" data-end="3684"&gt;Internally, fructose also binds to skin collagen, forming advanced glycation end-products (appropriately nicknamed “AGEs”) that stiffen tissue and deepen wrinkles. Think of it as shrink-wrapping your face in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3686" data-end="4212"&gt;During the 60-day trial, I swapped my 3 p.m. soda for sparkling water spiked with frozen raspberries. The first week felt like quitting a sitcom mid-season—flat, anticlimactic—but by week two my palate recalibrated and afternoon brain fog vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3686" data-end="4212"&gt;Track your own liquid intake for seven days; you might be shocked to find 200–400 stealth calories sliding through a straw. Replace half with flavored seltzer or unsweetened tea and watch your energy curve flatten in a good way—no more syrupy spikes followed by sleepy troughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4219" data-end="4262"&gt;4. Chasing that “always-on” adrenaline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4264" data-end="4522"&gt;When inbox pings trigger a cortisol surge, your body thinks it’s sprinting from a lion even while seated. Chronic stress shortens telomeres, spikes systemic inflammation, and sabotages collagen repair—effectively paying triple interest on a lifestyle loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4524" data-end="5142"&gt;My antidote borrowed from the trading floor: the 5-5-5 pause. Before replying to any tense email, I took five slow breaths, held for five seconds, and exhaled for five. The micro-ritual lasted under a minute but recalibrated my nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4524" data-end="5142"&gt;By week four the smartwatch data told its own story: fewer jaw-clench headaches, steadier heart-rate variability, and—surprise—more thoughtful email replies that required fewer follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4524" data-end="5142"&gt;If breathing apps feel woo-woo, rebrand them in financial terms: each deep inhale is a deposit in your cellular savings account; the momentary pause banks years of health dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5149" data-end="5183"&gt;5. Soaking up unprotected sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5185" data-end="5532"&gt;A little daylight sets your circadian clock, but ultraviolet rays punch holes in collagen faster than you can say “serum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5185" data-end="5532"&gt;Dermatology research estimates up to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790843/?.com"&gt;80 percent of visible facial aging&lt;/a&gt; stems from cumulative UV exposure. Translation: sunscreen is still the cheapest anti-aging product on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5534" data-end="6108"&gt;To ingrain the habit, I parked the sunscreen pump beside my toothbrush. Brushing equals SPF—no willpower required. Gel formulas with a barely-there finish replaced the heavy, beach-day lotions I loathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5534" data-end="6108"&gt;Two months later, my freckles stopped multiplying and friends asked if I’d “done something” to my skin. The answer was less glamorous than a laser treatment: I’d simply put a cap on daily sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5534" data-end="6108"&gt;For outdoor enthusiasts the rule of thumb is SPF 30 every two hours, wide-brim hat, and sunglasses that block UVA and UVB. Think of those shades as collagen’s bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6115" data-end="6147"&gt;6. Feeding the inner critic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6149" data-end="6522"&gt;Negative self-talk elevates cortisol and dampens dopamine, the double punch that drains motivation and accelerates biological wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6149" data-end="6522"&gt;Self-compassion researcher Kristin Neff points out that replacing harsh judgment with supportive inner dialogue flips the nervous system from threat to care and&lt;a href="https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/SC-Germer-Chapter.pdf?.com"&gt; generates a cascade of calming oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="7140"&gt;During the experiment I noticed how often my mental narrator sneered, “You’re behind,” or “You look exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="7140"&gt;Instead of shutting it down, I responded aloud, “We’re learning.” Sounds corny, but the verbal reframing turned sneers into neutral status reports—“Current position: improving; next step: tweak the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="7140"&gt;Over 60 days my posture subtly straightened, and I found myself volunteering for camera-on calls rather than hiding behind profile photos. Replace your critic with a coach: state the observation, then propose one constructive action. You’ll feel the emotional temperature drop almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7147" data-end="7184"&gt;7. Doom-scrolling into isolation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7186" data-end="7492"&gt;Scrolling a highlight reel while sitting alone convinces your brain everyone else is sprinting ahead, eroding self-worth and inviting &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf?.com"&gt;low-grade loneliness&lt;/a&gt;—a health risk comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to the U.S. Surgeon General’s 2023 advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7494" data-end="8166"&gt;My workaround was embarrassingly simple: after 8 p.m. my phone flips to grayscale. The washed-out palette turns vibrant feeds into dull spreadsheets—the temptation drops by half. The reclaimed minutes went toward ten-minute calls with friends, which spiked oxytocin and finished the day on an upward social note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7494" data-end="8166"&gt;You don’t need to delete social media; you need to corral it. Cap your social apps at 45 minutes daily, and pair each scroll session with a commitment to one real-time interaction—coffee chat, voice message, quick walk with your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7494" data-end="8166"&gt;The goal isn’t digital detox; it’s restoring balance so online life amplifies, rather than replaces, genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8173" data-end="8240"&gt;Younger is a daily ledger, not a distant lottery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8242" data-end="8711"&gt;Feeling youthful isn’t cosmetic; it’s compound interest on tiny choices. Over 60 days, trimming these seven habits recalibrated my energy, skin tone, and mood more reliably than any pricey potion or high-tech gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8242" data-end="8711"&gt;Pick one habit and run a two-week A/B test—compare your sleep score, afternoon alertness, or mirror check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8242" data-end="8711"&gt;Aging may be inevitable, but accelerated aging is often optional, and the levers sit in your calendar, pantry, inbox, and thought loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8713" data-end="8856"&gt;Your own 60-day clock starts whenever you decide to hit “optimize.” Here’s to budgeting for a younger tomorrow—one smarter line item at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting onions ranks among the most dreaded kitchen tasks for many &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/home/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with home"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; cooks. The inevitable tears and burning sensation can turn a simple &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/cooking/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with cooking"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; preparation into an uncomfortable experience. However, recent scientific research has uncovered a surprisingly straightforward method to chop onions without the waterworks. This technique could revolutionize how we approach this essential culinary ingredient that features in countless dishes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific insights into why onions make us cry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding why onions trigger tears helps explain the scientific solution. When you cut into an onion, you damage its cells, releasing enzymes that convert sulfur compounds into syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This volatile chemical rises through the air and irritates the sensitive membranes in your eyes, prompting them to produce tears as a protective response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-in-text-1" id="farmi-1297554083"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="3843226833" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This chemical reaction occurs naturally as a defense mechanism for the onion plant. Research conducted at Cornell University has delved deeper into this process, examining exactly how these irritating compounds become airborne during cutting. Their findings reveal that the method of cutting significantly impacts how much of this tear-inducing substance reaches your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional remedies like chilling onions or cutting them underwater offer limited effectiveness against this chemical reaction. However, the Cornell research team discovered that the primary factors affecting tear production relate to knife technique rather than external interventions. This revelation provides a practical solution that doesn’t require special equipment or preparation steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense-3" id="farmi-2526234600"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="9294255259" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense" id="farmi-1037479000"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/14/french-pastry-chefs-know-it-this-type-of-butter-makes-the-best-pie-crusts/"&gt;French pastry chefs know which butter creates superior pie crusts&lt;/a&gt;, professional chefs have long understood that proper knife skills make a difference when cutting onions – now &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/science/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with science"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; confirms why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The simple technique for tear-free onion cutting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking research from Cornell University reveals that two key factors determine how much eye-irritating spray gets released when cutting onions: knife sharpness and cutting speed. Contrary to what many might assume, the solution doesn’t involve fancy gadgets or unusual preparation methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists created a specialized guillotine apparatus that allowed them to test different blade types and cutting speeds while filming the resulting spray patterns. Their experiments conclusively demonstrated that using a sharp knife and cutting slowly dramatically reduces the amount of irritating compounds released into the air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using dull knives, the researchers observed that the blade pushed down on the onion layers, causing them to bend inward before springing back and forcefully ejecting juice into the air. Sharp knives, by contrast, cleanly slice through the onion cells without compressing them, minimizing juice spray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cutting speed proved equally important. Fast chopping motions, while seemingly efficient, actually generated more airborne mist. The researchers found that slowing down your cutting motion allows for more precise slicing and significantly less tear-inducing spray. This patient approach yields better results than rushing through the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This technique also carries additional benefits beyond preventing tears. The same approach that prevents &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/16/italians-add-this-ingredient-to-their-cakes-making-them-incredibly-moist-and-soft/"&gt;moisture loss when adding secret ingredients to cakes&lt;/a&gt; helps preserve the onion’s flavor compounds when cut properly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical applications beyond kitchen comfort&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend beyond simply making onion preparation more comfortable. The scientists noted that minimizing airborne food particles has broader hygiene benefits in the kitchen. Reducing the spray from cutting vegetables with tough outer layers helps limit the spread of potential pathogens during food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding proves particularly relevant for professional kitchens where large quantities of onions are processed daily. The cumulative effect of reducing airborne particles creates a healthier environment for food preparation. Commercial kitchens can benefit from implementing these techniques as standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For home cooks, adopting this method eliminates the need for quirky workarounds that many have tried over the years. No more swimming goggles, bread in the mouth, or freezing onions before cutting. The solution lies simply in using proper equipment and technique – a sharp knife and a patient cutting motion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maintaining sharp kitchen knives represents a wise investment for any &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/cook/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with cook"&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt;. While many focus on &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/21/this-is-the-household-appliance-that-consumes-the-most-electricity-after-heating/"&gt;reducing energy consumption of major kitchen appliances&lt;/a&gt;, proper knife maintenance requires minimal resources while delivering significant benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery reminds us that sometimes the most effective solutions come from understanding the science behind everyday problems. Just as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/03/14/more-and-more-gardeners-are-burying-bananas-in-their-gardens-and-once-you-know-why-it-makes-perfect-sense/"&gt;gardeners apply scientific principles when using natural fertilizers&lt;/a&gt;, home cooks can apply these findings to improve their culinary experience through better understanding of the chemistry happening in their kitchens&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Curtis Jackson was feeling fit and healthy in late 2020 when he decided to update his life insurance policy: He was in better shape than he'd been in a while, but he wanted to make sure his wife and three kids were taken care of if anything happened to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, now 46, underwent an intensive physical, and everything seemed to be going well until he received a strange phone call. The call was focused on a questionnaire he had filled out. Jackson had truthfully marked that he did not drink alcohol. But his liver numbers were those of "a functioning alcoholic," he was told. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It set off alarm bells. Jackson went to his primary care physician for another round of bloodwork. That doctor thought he had a problem with his gallbladder. Jackson went to have his gallbladder removed. During that operation, doctors found he had an unusual condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic, progressive disease affects the liver and inflames the bile ducts, causing liver damage. Patients eventually need a liver transplant. There's also a small but real chance of a deadly diagnosis: a dangerous cancer called cholangiocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early treatment and diagnosis can make a difference, so Jackson started undergoing two MRIs a year at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona to make sure he was cancer-free. He also had a regular test to check the progress of his PSC. In October 2024, Jackson had a nerve-wracking appointment where the technician scoping him seemed "very concerned." He felt healthy, but was worried by the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She didn't say that it was cancer, but she was hinting towards it," Jackson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, Jackson and his wife received the news he had been dreading: The tests had diagnosed him with the deadly cancer. He would need to undergo intensive treatment to try to fight the illness. It felt like a repeat of when he had had the initial PSC diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was feeling fine ... and both times netted a result of something pretty serious," Jackson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cholangiocarcinoma? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, is considered a silent killer, according to Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, the chairman of the division of hematology and medical oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Bekaii-Saab was Jackson's oncologist. It tends to spread to other organs before symptoms appear, so most patients are diagnosed "too late to cure," Bekaii-Saab said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% of people with PSC are diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, said Dr. Aqel Bashar, the director of the Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center in Phoenix, Arizona, who also treated Jackson. It's a rare disease, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people in the U.S., Bashar said. Not all cases are associated with PCS. Like many other cancers, it is on the rise, Bekaii-Saab said, with diagnoses of cholangiocarcinoma increasing more than 50% in the past decade. Fewer than 10% of the people diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma live more than five years, Bashar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to treat cholangiocarcinoma is with a liver transplant, Bekaii-Saab said. But it can only be done if the disease is caught early, before the cancer spreads. Many cholangiocarcinoma patients are not eligible for a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Jackson's case was caught early. He underwent three weeks of chemotherapy and radiation to kill as many cancer cells as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, I lived at Mayo Clinic. I would literally do work out of the parking lot, and then go and do radiation," Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During treatment, he lost about 30 pounds. But despite the odds, he remained optimistic that everything would work out. He even encouraged his wife to start a long-anticipated kitchen renovation. In the middle of the process, the family was told a liver was available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 6, he was wheeled into surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Surgery and recovery &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took about four hours. Six days later, Jackson was released from the hospital. Testing showed that he was cancer-free. For the next year, he will undergo weekly blood tests and have monthly check-ups. He will need close monitoring for the rest of his life, Bashar said, since his transplant needs to be monitored and doctors need to make sure his cholangiocarcinoma does not return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Jackson is trying to focus on his home and family, he said. His routine is "pretty close to normal," though he still can't lift more than 10 pounds, and climbing stairs can be draining. He gained back much of the weight he lost in treatment, and his energy levels are close to where they were before the cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are definitely getting back to normal, which is really exciting. I wasn't expecting that so fast," Jackson said. "We might call it either lucky, or blessed, or whatever. I am just so thankful that I was able to bounce back so quickly." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jacksons are putting the finishing touches on the kitchen renovation, and planning to travel to North Carolina for vacation this summer. He also wants to plan family trips outside the country once he needs less frequent check-ups. His other priority is turning his story into something that can help others, and advocating for organ transplant and donation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a new passion now," Jackson said. "I'm here because of these things. I would like to help this going forward and make sure people are learning the importance of donation." &lt;/p&gt;

The risk isn’t theoretical — it’s been repeatedly proven in outbreak after outbreak.” )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Stefano Oppo via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefano Oppo via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The greens that end up in a bag can come from multiple different farms and locations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And despite the efforts to reduce leafy green-related outbreaks, they continue to occur. Leafy greens are attributed to “up to 9.2% of known pathogen-caused foodborne illnesses” in the U.S., according to a report in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X24000590" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Journal of Foodborne Illness" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X24000590" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Foodborne Illness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in April 2024. The report estimates over 2.3 million illnesses every year are related to contaminated leafy greens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the food supply chain becomes contaminated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the farm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contamination can occur at different stages before bagged salad greens reach the refrigerated produce section and eventually your plate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the field, produce can become contaminated with pathogens from sources such as contaminated irrigation water, wild or domesticated animals, soil, or air,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/kabaker" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kimberly Baker," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/kabaker" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kimberly Baker,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University. It’s more common to have contaminated greens “when the field is in close proximity to livestock farms or feedlots where animals are being held in densely populated conditions,” Roszkowski explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arizona and California are big producers of leafy greens in the United States and are often near large cattle operations, according to Detwiler. E. coli, salmonella, or listeria can be introduced to the crops through contaminated irrigation water from nearby cattle farms, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Runoff from manure lagoons can seep into irrigation canals and contaminate fields with deadly bacteria like E. coli O157:H7,” Detwiler continued. Manure lagoons are large pits where livestock waste is stored, per &lt;a href="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Environmental" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Environmental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" America" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt; America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And it’s not only contaminated water that can be a problem. Some farms use unregulated water sources to irrigate the fields. “Some farms use untreated or minimally treated surface water from rivers, lakes or canals, increasing the risk of contamination,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it’s time to harvest, there are added risks for pathogens and bacteria to come in contact with lettuce. “Contamination can occur through human handling, contaminated equipment or water used in post-harvest processes to transport, produce or remove soil,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the processing plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are opportunities for pathogens to come in contact with leafy greens once they reach a processing plant. The greens you get in a bag don’t typically come from one field but from multiple farms, complicating traceability and increasing contamination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens are processed in a centralized area and distributed — which is convenient for all the companies involved in the process— but not ideal from a food safety standpoint. “Greens from different farms are mixed, washed and packaged together, so one contaminated leaf can impact thousands of bags across multiple states,” Detwiler explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lettuce is washed in large vats, added &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rosemary Trout," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rosemary Trout,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; associate professor and program director of Culinary Arts &amp;amp; Food Science at Drexel University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What you may not suspect, according to Trout, is that “plant foods are usually more often associated with foodborne illness than animal products.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the journey to store shelves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the greens cold is necessary to prevent any pathogens from growing and spreading. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “Not keeping the greens consistently cold throughout the process of harvesting, processing and transporting can cause bacterial growth to occur.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, refrigeration doesn’t eliminate the chance of pathogens; it can help slow them down. “Refrigeration slows bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria, meaning contaminated greens can still cause illness, even if stored properly,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will washing prewashed salad greens help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re thinking, “W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ell, I’ll wash my prewashed greens for extra safety measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” don’t. Washing greens at home doesn’t make them safer because water won’t remove the pathogens, Detwiler said. Rinsing prewashed greens can introduce pathogens that may be lurking on your counter or sink. “Prewashed greens should not be rewashed at home, as doing so can introduce contamination if the sink, utensils, equipment or hands of the preparer are not properly cleaned or sanitized,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Washing greens can remove pesticides, but it's not been proven to be effective in removing pathogens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria or pathogens aren’t obvious and can’t be seen. “If greens are contaminated with pathogens, they cannot be detected by sight, smell or taste … and can’t be removed by washing,” Baker explained. According to Detwiler, “Bacteria like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can form biofilms that help them stick to the surface of the leaves [and] once attached, these bacteria do not simply rinse off.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harmful pathogens need to be cooked to be eliminated, as heat kills them, said Detwiler. A big issue with lettuce is it’s usually eaten raw, not cooked, “making it challenging to reduce the risk of foodborne illness,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for buying bagged greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you still prefer buying bagged greens for the convenience, there are several precautions to take. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for recalls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before you purchase any salad greens, check if there are any recalls, advised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detwiler and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Stay updated on recalls via the FDA and CDC websites,” Detwiler said. “If your greens are part of an outbreak, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;throw them away immediately.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check expiration dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts say you should look at the expiration dates before purchasing. Trout advises to only buy what you will eat within a day or two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid bags with excess moisture that look wet, as damp environments are a haven for bacteria to thrive, Detwiler said. “Inspect the package to ensure the lettuce looks fresh, without wilting or discoloration, as these signs may indicate improper storage or reduced freshness,” Baker said. You also want to stay away from any bags that have slimy leaves, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski added&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize temperature changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you’ve purchased greens, don’t let them sit in a hot car or garage or out on the counter. “Avoid drastic changes in temperature when transporting them from the store and when preparing a meal,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “This leads to condensation and creates a moist and warm environment that can encourage both spoilage and bacterial growth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens should be kept refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, say Detwiler and Trout. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy heads of lettuce &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purchasing a head of lettuce or a bunch of spinach may have the extra step of rinsing and drying before tossing in a salad bowl or stir-frying, but you could be minimizing the risk of lurking pathogens. “Whole heads of lettuce or spinach have less surface area for contamination compared to pre-cut, mixed bagged greens,” Detwiler said. He suggests rinsing them under cold water — not soaking — to remove dirt, debris, any insects and surface-level bacteria. “Wash them at home before eating.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Ossett前列腺癌患者敦促男性进行检查- BBC | Ossett prostate cancer patient urges men to have checks - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5rb1hRWFJLbW5DNjh3bml6bV9zOTF1NV9SaUhBWEJiNmR3NVNhUWhyaGQzNHhPUF9yN2pTQ3FqTmd0NUNrY01SdjZyNksxRktkanBBSEtLZTc3QdIBX0FVX3lxTE5ULWtYOGVsZjVjQXJuYzRCNDdpN01EOXpMV1hKbHN0dzZaWXRNZE52dmJ6STI2eTRjb25IVVMwYm1URUxuQVFDYWQxajRUdE5WYmtkTi1Nd1d2LWVaMkI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'Prostate cancer diagnosis felt like a black hole'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf7d/live/63effdd0-479f-11f0-852d-2b00931dcf75.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="PCUK A man in a black polo shirt sits in a white armchair.

"We typically thought of the sperm as a bag of DNA on a tail. But as we've started to realise, it's quite a complex cell – there's a lot of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3015006/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;[other] genetic information in there&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost 200 years later, in 1869, Johannes Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician and biologist, was studying human white blood cells collected from pus left on soiled hospital bandages when he &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268995/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;discovered what he called "nuclein"&lt;/a&gt; inside the nuclei. The term "nuclein" was later changed to "nucleic acid" and eventually became "deoxyribonucleic acid" – or "DNA". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since then, our understanding of sperm has moved on leaps and bounds. But &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000953" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;much still remains a mystery&lt;/a&gt;, says Watkins. As scientists have started to better understand early embryonic development, he adds, they are realising that sperm doesn't just pass the father's chromosomes on, but also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-025-01815-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;epigenetic information&lt;/a&gt;, an extra layer of information that affects how and when the genes should be used. "It can really influence how the embryo develops and potentially the lifelong trajectory of the offspring that those sperm generate," says Watkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;It turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up – Scott Pitnick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sperm cells begin to form from puberty onwards, made in vessels within the testicles called seminiferous tubules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you look inside the testes where the sperm are made, it starts as just a round cell that looks pretty much like anything else," says Watkins. "Then it undergoes this dramatic change where it becomes a sperm head with a tail. No other cell within the body changes its structure, its shape, in such a unique way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After ejaculation, each of these tiny cells must propel themselves forward (alongside their 50 million competitors) using their tail-like appendages to swim for the egg.

Human sperm cells are microscopic, so we can't see them with the naked eye. But some fruit fly species produce sperm cells &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18005" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;20 times their own body length&lt;/a&gt;. That would be like a man producing sperm the length of a 40m (130ft) python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Why do males in some species make a few giant sperm?" asks Pitnick. "The answer, it turns out, is because females have evolved reproductive tracts that favour them." That's "not really much of an answer", he adds, because it's just the redirects the question: why have females evolved this way? "We still don't understand that at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Research suggests sperm counts are tumbling globally and the decline appears to be accelerating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it does teach us that sperm as they exist in the male body is only half the story, says Pitnick. "There's a massive sex bias historically in science. There's been this obscenely biased male focus on male traits. But it turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It turns out the female reproductive tract is this incredibly, rapidly evolving environment," says Pitnick, "and we don't know much about what sperm do inside the female. That is the big, hidden world. I think the female reproductive tract is the greatest unexplored frontier for sexual selection, theory and speciation [the process by which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/speciation-the-origin-of-new-species-26230527/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new species are formed&lt;/a&gt;]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The fruit fly's long-tailed sperm, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02587-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests Pitnick&lt;/a&gt;, could be considered an ornament – much like a deer's antlers or a peacock's tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ornaments are a "sort of a weapon in evolution", explains Pitnick. More than just a defence from predators, ornaments like antlers and horns often have two roles to play. "A lot of these weapons are about sex, and usually male-male competition. The [fruit fly's] long sperm flagellum really meets the definitional criteria of an ornament. We think the female tract has traits that bias fertilisation in favour of some sperm phenotypes over others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We know a lot about pre-mating sexual selection, Pitnick says. "Say, it's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20240902-how-controlled-burns-can-help-wildlife" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prairie chickens dancing&lt;/a&gt; out on a grassland, or a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023wbh0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bird of paradise displaying&lt;/a&gt; in a rainforest. It's motion, it's colour, it's smells?" Processing this sensory input, explains Pitnick, leads to decision making – whether the pair mate or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But, Pitnick says, the sexual selection that goes on inside the female after mating – and how this drives the evolution of sperm – largely remains a mystery. "We still understand very little about the genetics of ornaments and preferences," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Sperm are so tiny that they can be difficult to study.

"Sperm are not mature when they finish developing in the testes, they're not done developing." Complex – and critical – interactions occur between the sperm and the female reproductive tract, he says. "We're now spending a lot of time studying what we call &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://experts.syr.edu/en/publications/post-ejaculatory-modifications-to-sperm-pems" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;post-ejaculatory modifications to sperm&lt;/a&gt; across the whole animal kingdom." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/978920068315" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2023 report&lt;/a&gt; published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), around one in six adults worldwide experience infertility – and male infertility contributes to roughly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20230327-how-pollution-is-causing-a-male-fertility-crisis" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;half of all cases&lt;/a&gt;. (It's also worth noting that many people around the world are not having as many children as they want for other reasons too, such as the prohibitive cost of parenthood, as a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynq459wxgo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent United Nation population Fund report highlighted&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"With all those moving parts, there are so many things that could go wrong," says Hannah Morgan, a post-doctoral research associate in maternal and fetal health at the University of Manchester, UK. "It could be a mechanism: it doesn't swim very well, so it can't get to the egg. Or it could be something more intricate within the head of the sperm, or other regions of the sperm. It's so specialised in so many different ways, that lots of little things can go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One way to see if a man may be infertile is to look inside the sperm, says Morgan. "How does the DNA look? How is it packaged? How fragmented is it? To break open the sperm, there's a whole range of stuff you could look at. But what is a good or bad measurement? We don't actually know." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Perhaps by unravelling the mystery of sperm and how they function, Morgan says, we might begin to understand male infertility too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:01:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPektuVkZrZTRMWnRMSHF0UGdvNGRrUXF6OWpjeXRtNHZwUHdBMTlwVk0wY3ZfZGNDRFFZQ2RpeWlLRk1POVQtZXl0ZTdLODc5clVfWHg4N0lzcmpLRVJuZVVwbjVYbXpFME1WQzYwczd3VXJOc29SeXVKWklNUjFSQjNndldoV1pfZnhTWGhpNUpIeEw5NG5vcWduWDdTLVBfZVBz</guid></item><item><title>肠道问题、糖尿病或高血压？抛弃这些水果-印度时报 | Gut issues, Diabetes or High BP?

Most of the times, that is largely the case, but some fruits can actually increase certain medical conditions because of their sugar content, acidity, or nutrient burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to steer clear of can assist you in controlling symptoms better and with more informed decisions. Below is a guide to which fruits may not be your friend if you have any of the following conditions. (source: Healthline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, blood glucose control is paramount. Fruits such as bananas and grapes can be harmful; they contain a high glycemic wallop. Their natural sugars are rapidly absorbed and will give your glucose levels a boost. You don't have to eliminate all fruits, but it's advisable to stick to lower-sugar choices such as berries and steer clear of overly ripe types altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kidney issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with compromised kidney function, potassium can build up to dangerous levels. Bananas and oranges are particularly high in potassium, which can strain the kidneys. It’s best to limit or avoid these fruits if your doctor has warned you about high potassium intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatives like apples or grapes are typically better tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Joint Pain or inflammatory conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have arthritis or chronic joint inflammation, some of the fruits in the nightshade category, such as tomatoes and eggplants, trigger inflammation. While technically fruits, these may be included in main courses rather than desserts. Many people experience flare-ups if they eat them regularly, so an elimination trial could identify whether they're a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bloating and gas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples, watermelon, and cherries are gut fermenters. If you have issues with bloating or discomfort in the digestive system, these FODMAP-rich fruits may be the offender. Limiting the amount or cooking them lightly might help alleviate symptoms. Watch how your body reacts, particularly if your digestive system is already sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skin issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin conditions such as acne, eczema, or psoriasis can be exacerbated by some tropical fruits. Mangoes, pineapples, and oranges are high in substances that could possibly cause inflammation or allergic responses in sensitive patients. If your flare-ups occur around fruit-laden meals, try reducing to observe if your skin improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty or sugary fruits such as coconut and dried fruits are problematic for individuals with heart ailments. Dried fruits might be a healthy choice for snacks, but they tend to be calorie-rich and sugary. Coconut has been known to have saturated fat that might increase cholesterol levels. Be moderate about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stomach sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have acid reflux or a sensitive stomach lining, pineapples and citrus fruits can irritate your system. Their acidity level is extremely high, causing discomfort or aggravating gastritis. If you suffer from digestive flare-ups, go for less acidic fruits such as bananas or melons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with compromised immune systems need to exercise care with overripe or dried fruits. They may contain molds or provide a source of food for toxic gut bacteria, resulting in infections or imbalances. Fresh, well-washed fruits are always the best option, and anything which appears excessively soft or fermented or has been stored for long periods should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High cholesterol and migraine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut, dried fruits, and citrus could aggravate both. Coconut's saturated fat and dried fruits' concentrated sugars can lead to increased cholesterol. Citrus, on the other hand, has been reported to induce migraines in others. If you're susceptible to either, staying vigilant about your consumption can spell a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits are usually a foundation of healthy eating, but when you have a chronic illness, it's all about personalization. It's not about vilifying any single fruit it's about making wiser, more individualised decisions for your body. Always speak with your doctor or a registered dietitian before removing foods from your diet, but being aware of these associations can make you feel more in charge of your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxONDhfVHc1a3dwZ0M5amFUbTkwdDRuZ25ic3hpWmVBbG1xc2ZYMVNDNUUzWFRYUEdxYnRZdFJuTGRpS1JTTUlzc1FuZ3VFa2FFSHdoNEFobnZJVjZUMDVKelhZbUZoUXFSczZmTEVTdm14Zjdpdm8zOWh5cTVtLU9FNVplY2VDZEVyTjZpeXB6SFBVSy1xMW5tbG9vaTM1NWN3Mng3QThrc3UxcTdybFBXWTZheUlWWk1ydDRiak5TN3NHd01OeF9RQ2lEc2NyWDRKeXZLR3Z5UmUyblc2NUl1eWFESQ</guid></item><item><title>甜点中令人惊讶的成分会增加心脏病发作的风险-每日邮报 | Surprising ingredient in dessert favorites that raises your risk of a heart attack - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiologists are warning of an often overlooked ingredient in desserts that can lead to high blood pressure if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically a garnish on cookies, bread and butter, soft pretzels, and caramel treats, coarse sea salt contains more sodium than its less expensive grocery store alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People enjoy the added crunch and marriage of savory and sweet in desserts, but people are inadvertently eating too much salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because coarse salt has larger crystals, it may feel less salty per bite, leading some people to use more than they would with fine salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14603535/Adding-salt-food-increase-risk-depression-anxiety-40-cent-study-finds.html"&gt;only needs a small amount&lt;/a&gt; of sodium to function properly.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Body parts like hands, feet, and ankles are likely to swell. And feelings of thirst take over due to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much salt before bed can also cause restless sleep. Studies suggest high-salt diets may alter cortisol (stress hormone) levels, which regulate sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12737661/Reducing-salt-one-teaspoon-blood-pressure-medication.html" class=""&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Vanderbilt University found that reducing daily salt intake by just one teaspoon is as effective as blood pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tested high and low-salt diets on hundreds of patients, some of whom had high blood pressure, and found that cutting out a can of Heinz soup each day lowered people's blood pressure by six percent within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduction was comparable to that of thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, a popular blood pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 89 percent of adults and around 94 percent of children consume too much sodium, according to the CDC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;“Obviously we need some sodium—it's essential for life,” Dr Egan said. But ‘here we are with an average intake of 3,400 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now the body has to make a lot of adjustments, but we can get by with very little sodium,’ he said, noting ‘there's very little danger in this country that most people won't get enough sodium, even if they're eating those fresh foods and not processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They'll still—for the most part—get more than sufficient sodium that the body needs,” said Dr. Egan. “We live in a state of pretty much constant excess.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're anything like me, you hit the 3 p.m. slump and suddenly you're ready to eat the nearest houseplant. I used to reach for whatever was closest—usually something sugary and regrettable—until I realized that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-high-protein-snack-11712761" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-packed snack&lt;/a&gt; could turn my afternoon around. There's a lot of hype about protein, but it's not just nutritionist-speak.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating protein-packed snacks into your daily routine can be the catalyst for bettering your energy levels and overall well-being. But here's some even better news: You don't have to spend a lot of money or hours scouring specialty stores to find these nutritional gems. As a food writer, Aldi is one of my favorite places to stock up on budget-friendly, convenient and nutrient-rich snacks. Below are six Aldi finds you'll want to toss into your cart the next time you hit up the store.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Friendly Farms Low Fat Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese and I had a complicated relationship for years. But more recently, I've become a convert. At just 80 calories per ½-cup serving, Friendly Farms cottage cheese delivers an impressive 13 grams of protein—making it one of the most &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291961/10-high-protein-snacks-that-keep-you-feeling-full-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-dense snacks&lt;/a&gt; you can grab.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Casein, the main protein in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-11728968" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;, digests slowly—meaning it keeps you full longer, says &lt;a href="https://dominationdietitian.com/index.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lacy Puttuck, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. That’s one of the reasons she recommends it as a snack. “Its slow-digesting quality means you'll stay fuller longer,” she explains. It's also an easy way to get a good amount of calcium. Each serving contains 114 milligrams of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bone-supporting nutrient&lt;/a&gt;—that's 11% of the recommended daily value (DV).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cottage cheese also earns points for being endlessly adaptable in a range of sweet and savory applications. Some afternoons, if I'm in the mood for something sweet, I'll top it with fresh seasonal berries or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/no-added-sugar-chia-seed-jam-8728331" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;chia jam&lt;/a&gt;. Other days, I’ll mix it with everything bagel seasoning for something more savory. Or I’ll even turn it into a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8039820/high-protein-2-ingredient-cottage-cheese-ice-cream-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;2-ingredient ice cream&lt;/a&gt; (yes, really!) or use it in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-upgrade-for-your-morning-toast-11681776" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;myriad other ways&lt;/a&gt; on toast.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These bars are what happens when someone finally gets the assignment right. They taste like a treat but pack 10 g of protein and 6 g of fiber—"a great amount," according to Puttuck, who notes that the fiber "works to increase satiety and feed a healthy gut microbiome."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The classic combination of nuts and dark chocolate nails the sweet-salty balance while keeping the sugar low at only 6 g. Because they're individually wrapped, I can easily keep them in my purse, backpack or gym bag as a quick energy source in a pinch.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Greek yogurt lovers, this one's for you. With an incredible 15 g of protein, zero fat and zero added sugar, this yogurt is a nutritional all-star packed into a convenient cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The berry flavor is sweet without any added sugar, and the thick, creamy texture rivals much more expensive brands. What makes &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; especially valuable goes beyond just its high-protein content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "One of the biggest benefits of yogurt is the active probiotics that are in it," says Puttuck, who advises eating a bit of yogurt daily to "improve and maintain optimal gut health." If you're not yet convinced, Puttuck positions yogurt as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mood food&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; stating, "The microbes typically found in yogurt can also improve mood by increasing the production of serotonin."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Current research backs this and also sees it as a possible antidote to depression.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To make it even better, top it with fruit or granola, or turn the vanilla version into a frozen, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053032/high-protein-yogurt-cup-dessert-tastes-like-a-snickers-bar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Snickers-like treat&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes, I need something salty and crunchy, and these peanuts deliver exactly that. One ounce provides 8 g of protein along with a bit of fiber and some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, which Puttuck advises "can promote brain and nervous system health."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I like the simple sea salt seasoning for flavor (and because it plays into the same snacky vibe as chips). And if you're highly active or outdoors a lot in the summer, Puttuck says, they're a great choice for getting those much-needed electrolytes during hot weather.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These individually-packaged beef sticks have saved me countless times when traveling or needing something ultra-portable. With 8 g of protein per stick, they are perfect for keeping hunger at bay.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, Country Archer is known for using higher-quality ingredients like grass-fed beef, which has higher levels of omega-3s than conventionally grain-fed beef. "Beef contains a good vitamin and mineral profile," says Puttuck, adding that "some of these include vitamin B12 for DNA and energy production and iron to maintain optimal oxygen levels." County Archer's beef sticks contain just 1 mg of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-iron-8733430" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; each, but at about 6% of your daily iron needs, that's pretty impressive for such a convenient snack.

With 18 g of protein per package, they combine the satisfaction of multiple flavors and textures in one convenient serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The meat, cheese and breadsticks feel indulgent while still supporting your goals. Puttuck loves these because they're "very satisfying" thanks to the "fats and protein that can carry through the day." It's the kind of snack that never feels restrictive, which is exactly what I need.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond keeping hunger at bay, high-protein snacks offer some much bigger benefits. Protein plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle mass, supporting immune function and regulating blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snacks-more-protein-than-egg-11744826" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich snacks&lt;/a&gt;, you're setting up your body to function well and feel great.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research consistently shows that protein has the highest thermic effect of any macronutrient—meaning your body burns more calories digesting it compared to carbs or fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This makes high-protein snacking particularly valuable if you have weight management goals. Perhaps most importantly, protein helps stabilize your energy levels throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So instead of experiencing the energy rollercoaster that often comes with high-sugar snacks, protein provides steady, sustained fuel that supports physical &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; mental performance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Convenient, high-protein snacks are a helpful tool in a balanced diet. When shopping for high-protein snacks at Aldi or any grocery store, Puttuck emphasizes the importance of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-i-check-first-on-the-nutrition-label-8548484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reading labels carefully&lt;/a&gt;, looking for products with minimal ingredients and trying to avoid ingredients like high fructose corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, which she says can "have adverse health effects on the body." Choose minimally processed snacks whenever you can—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067928/how-to-know-when-boiled-eggs-are-done/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hard-boiled eggs&lt;/a&gt; and jerky are two of her favorites. Outside of this, look for at least 7 g of protein (Puttuck says 10 to 15 g is even better).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smart, protein-rich choices like these aren't just great for curbing hunger—they can also help stabilize energy, support muscle health and improve overall well-being. Whether you’re powering through an afternoon work sprint, recovering from a workout, or just trying to avoid hangry spirals, these are the snacks you’ll reach for again and again.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/?s=measles" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/?s=measles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; visited Boston over the weekend, health officials warned Friday, sharing a hotel, museum and airport terminal where other people may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boston Public Health Commission and Massachusetts Department of Public Health said the infected person was in the city June 7-8.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The health agencies are working to identify and alert people who may have been exposed. They specified that people who were at the following locations at the listed times could be affected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Westin Boston Seaport District hotel, and the restaurants inside, between 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 7 and 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, June 8&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The Museum of Fine Arts Boston between 1 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, June 8&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Logan Airport Terminal C between 5 p.m. and 11:15 p.m. on Sunday, June 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The person then flew to Miami on JetBlue Flight 639 on Sunday, departing at 9:12 p.m., health officials said, noting that they are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to notify passengers who are at risk of being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

								Health officials are warning about misleading information aimed at preventing measles as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports rising case numbers across the United States.
							&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are not vaccinated against measles who have been exposed should contact their health care provider immediately, health officials said, adding that they need to avoid public places and monitor for symptoms for 21 days, or through June 29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing data from the DPH, the BPHC said 94% of children in Suffolk County are fully vaccinated against measles, explaining that it is 93% to 97% effective in preventing infection and protecting against severe disease. Boston Public Health Commissioner Dr. Bisola Ojikutu told reporters Saturday morning that the city's strong vaccination means Boston is "protected from a large measles outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're hopeful that we will not see many cases in this instance," she said, stressing that the Boston Public Health Commission has been preparing for a case to arrive and "hopefully protect us from any additional cases or a large outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stressed that Health officials said measles is "a highly contagious virus that begins with flu-like symptoms, including cough, high fever, runny nose, and red, watery eyes, followed by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body." It can be spread through breathing, coughing and sneezing, and it can be contracted if surfaces are touched within two hours of an infected person being in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has seen &lt;a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/united-states-1001-measles-cases-11-states-active-outbreaks/3710161/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/united-states-1001-measles-cases-11-states-active-outbreaks/3710161/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;an uptick in measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, with several states reporting outbreaks. Two unvaccinated children have died in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult died in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person with measles who traveled through Boston didn't arrive at the airport or arrive from abroad, Ojikutu told reporters, but couldn't share more about where they were previously — patient health data is confidential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city typically gets up to two cases of measles per years, a low level she attributed to Boston's vaccination rate. She believed the last uptick in cases was in 2011, amid a statewide bump in cases of about two dozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ojikutu reported that contract tracing efforts were going well with the Museum of Fine Arts, Westin and the CDC, and that guests of the MFA and hotel who may have been exposed should expect to receive a notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This case of measles highlights the importance of obtaining the MMR vaccine to protect ourselves and our community. The MMR vaccine is highly effective at preventing measles infection and also protects against mumps and rubella," Ojikutu said in an earlier statement. "Children should receive the vaccine at 12-15 months of age and again before kindergarten to ensure strong immunity. Children who are at least 6 months old who are traveling internationally should receive an early dose of vaccine before traveling. It is never too late for children or adults to get the measles vaccine and for the vaccine to be effective, even if they are past the age recommended by doctors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent segment on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the “Today” show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://drchantrise.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Chantrise Holliman&lt;/a&gt;, a mother, wife and heart health educator based in Georgia,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shared the story of her &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/heart-attack" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; and what seemed like the fairly benign symptoms that accompanied it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliman experienced nausea, vomiting and mild chest pressure. The first two symptoms ― which aren’t commonly associated with heart attacks ― led her to believe the sensations had more to do with her dinner the night before than a serious medical concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Holliman, many people don’t know that stomach symptoms can, indeed, be signs of a heart attack. While not the most common warning sign (chest pain is most reported), nausea is also not uncommon during a cardiac event, according to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1316106776/sean-p-heffron" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Sean Heffron&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “tends to depend somewhat on which blood vessel in the heart is affected,” Heffron explained. Additionally, nausea is more commonly seen in women, Heffron said, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/heart_attack.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;as is vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other heart attack signs in women include jaw pain, neck pain, a dull feeling of chest discomfort, upper abdomen pain, back pain and excessive tiredness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to hear stories like this, because many women think it has to be like, ‘I’m clutching my chest and falling to the ground like you see in the movies,’ and it can be much more subtle,” Dr. Tara Narula, a cardiologist and NBC News medical contributor, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;told “Today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks can look very different in women than in men, which means that sufferers and doctors alike sometimes dismiss them. But it’s important to recognize the signs, especially since heart disease “is the leading cause of death for women in this country,” Narula told “Today.” “One woman every 80 seconds dies of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell if your nausea is part of a heart attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

						The New Mexico Department of Health is warning the public about a possible measles exposure in Bernalillo, Santa Fe and Sandoval counties.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching your 60s is a milestone worth celebrating. And while this decade can be filled with travel and more time spent with family, you may also experience some unexpected changes that aren’t quite as welcoming. To keep your energy levels up, mood stable and health on track year after year, it’s important to be intentional about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067323/7-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the food on your plate&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain foods can go a long way in supporting your body as it ages, whether it’s by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boosting brain health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strengthening bones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-foods-to-eat-in-january-8768223" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protecting your heart&lt;/a&gt;. According to dietitians, adding more of these six nutrient-packed foods to your routine can help you feel your best and stay active and energized throughout your golden years. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most powerful foods for longevity is one that you don’t actually need a lot of to see big benefits. “Walnuts provide plant-based omega-3s, antioxidants and polyphenols, all of which play a role in brain and heart health as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, partner with California Walnuts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using data from the Nurses’ Health Study, researchers found that women who ate at least two servings or walnuts per week in their late 50s and early 60s were more likely to experience healthy aging, which includes being free from chronic disease, memory problems, physical disability and mental health issues after age 65 compared to those who did not eat walnuts regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aim to enjoy 2 ounces of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069681/benefits-of-walnuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walnuts&lt;/a&gt; weekly, either on their own or incorporated into recipes. Try adding these crunchy nuts to salads, overnight oats, homemade snack bars and more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legumes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining bone density is critical for maintaining independence and overall quality of life as we age. Approximately 10 million adults over age 65 have osteoporosis, and while physical activity and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-ways-to-maintain-muscle-mass-to-live-longer-8547770" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; help, adding legumes to your diet can also support bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Legumes are an excellent source of plant-based protein and fiber, supporting muscle maintenance, gut health and reduced inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Legumes include beans, lentils, peas and peanuts. While all legumes can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support strong bones&lt;/a&gt;, chickpeas may be particularly beneficial. The isoflavones and polyphenols in chickpeas may help prevent osteoporosis by supporting bone metabolism and reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Palinski-Wade explains that these mechanisms are especially helpful and relevant for women post-menopause, who are most at risk for bone loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-pistachios"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Pistachios &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A handful of pistachios daily can help to improve intake of fiber and key nutrients, including healthy fats, protein and antioxidants, like lutein, which helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-protect-your-vision-8773401" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protect vision&lt;/a&gt; and supports overall health with age,” says Palinksi-Wade, a consultant for American Pistachio Growers. Additionally, one small study found that eating 2 ounces of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pistachios daily&lt;/a&gt; for 4 months reduced oxidative damage and increased the gene expression of specific genes that may support the reversal of certain metabolic conditions that are more common with age, including insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Plus, as a good source of plant-based protein and fiber, pistachios can help to boost satiety with only 160 calories per serving, which can be beneficial when working towards maintaining a healthy body weight,” adds Palinski-Wade.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Leafy greens like spinach, kale and collard greens are rich in vitamin K and folate, which help support brain health and may slow age-related cognitive decline,” says &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy RDN LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Diets high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/leafy-green-packed-recipes-that-arent-salad-8619158" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dark leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; have been associated with improved memory and overall cognitive function in older adults and may even help slow cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These vegetables are rich in brain-supportive nutrients like phylloquinone, beta-carotene and vitamin E, which are thought to support learning and memory,” says Cassetty.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-cranberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Cranberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over 60% of older adults in the United States do not regularly eat dark leafy vegetables.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Certain medications, like blood thinners, require consistent intake of vitamin K, which is found in greens like spinach and kale. However, this doesn’t mean you need to avoid these vegetables completely. If you take blood thinners, or another medication that interacts with vitamin K, talk with a healthcare professional about how to safely incorporate leafy greens in your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For older adults with difficulties chewing, Hardy recommends steaming, sautéing or pureeing greens rather than enjoying them raw. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cranberry-health-benefits-8726317" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cranberries&lt;/a&gt; are rich in anthocyanins and proanthocyanins—antioxiants that support numerous aspects of health, from your brain to your urinary tract. Anthocyanins in cranberries are responsible for their vibrant red color and play a key role in protecting and supporting brain cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Thanks to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, anthocyanins are being studied for their potential role in reducing the risk of brain disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Manaker MS, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cranberries can also be helpful for preventing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962519/uti-bacteria-gut-health-new-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt; (UTIs). While both men and women can experience UTIs, it’s estimated that over 10% of women over age 65 and 30% of women 85 years and older have a UTI at least once a year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “There are compounds in cranberries called proanthocyanidins (PACs), which have been shown to maintain urinary tract health,” says Manaker. These compounds help prevent bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, which can help decrease infection rates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-prunes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Prunes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bone loss is one of the most common and dangerous side effects of aging. Luckily, eating to protect and maintain bone health can be both delicious and simple. “Prunes contain bioactive compounds that may help blunt bone loss, so they're another tool in your toolkit to support healthy aging,” says Cassetty. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one study, postmenopausal women who ate 50 grams, or approximately 5–6 prunes, per day had reduced rates of total hip bone mineral density loss over 6 to 12 months, whereas women who did not eat prunes experienced increased fracture risk scores at 6 months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also noteworthy, this study had a 90% compliance rate, proving just how easy and simple it is to add &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/prunes-benefits-8694943" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt; to your diet. The delicious sweet taste and jelly-like texture make them a welcome addition to salads, toast and smoothies—or just to enjoy by the handful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly backed up? The high fiber content of prunes can also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfast-foods-to-help-you-poop-that-arent-oatmeal-8708873" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ease constipation&lt;/a&gt; to make bathroom visits smoother (literally).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just be sure to drink more water to minimize side effects associated with increased fiber intake, like gas and bloating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you put on your plate plays a key role in healthy aging, but it’s far from the only factor. The following strategies can help you feel your best now and support your health in the years to come. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a Regular Sleep Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: Prioritize a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consistent sleep&lt;/a&gt; and wake routine, even on days when you don’t have anywhere to be, encourages Palinski-Wade. Regular sleep may be more important than duration, with some studies showing that people getting consistent sleep have a 20 to 48% lower risk of death from any cause than those with irregular sleep patterns.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep your body moving—and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;make it enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;! “Find something you love, whether it's dancing, walking, gardening or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine,” says Manaker. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Connection&lt;/strong&gt;: Research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and social isolation have a mortality risk similar to smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, physical inactivity and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Make it a priority to stay connected with family and friends and consider joining a club or attending a fitness class once a week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Your Mind Active&lt;/strong&gt;: Staying mentally engaged through learning, puzzles, strategic games and other activities can support &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; and cognition as you age. Researchers found that people under 75 who regularly participated in cognitively stimulating tasks and activities saw the greatest increases in cognitive function and memory.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aging well doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire diet and lifestyle. Focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7900915/foods-associated-with-living-longer-according-to-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt;, engaging in joyful movement and maintaining a consistent routine can help you feel your best well into your 60s, 70s and beyond.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Health officials in Washington and Oregon are warning the public about a sharp rise in pertussis cases, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/whooping-cough-cases-rising-again/507-b322a88b-1e12-4e48-af99-fec8d9364874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;also known as whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;, and urging people to stay current on their vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Washington, more than 2,200 cases were reported statewide in 2024, a startling increase from just 87 cases in 2023, according to state health officials. As of May 2025, more than 1,300 cases have already been reported.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors said the illness can be particularly dangerous for infants and young children. They recommend that people ensure they and their children are up to date on pertussis vaccinations. Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease. Early symptoms are often similar to the common cold but can develop into violent coughing fits, difficulty breathing and other serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Oregon, the state recorded 123 cases of pertussis in May alone, according to the Oregon Health Authority. So far in 2025, there have been 877 reported cases statewide, with the majority in Washington County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that several nutrients are linked with a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nutrients include vitamins and minerals that act as antioxidants, plus fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High sugar intake was related to an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, it’s natural to become more forgetful. But when the occasional “Where did I leave my keys?” becomes forgetting loved ones’ names and your own address, it may be a sign of something more serious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is a general term for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loss of memory&lt;/a&gt;, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities, severe enough to interfere with everyday life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is the most common type of dementia. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dementia cases are expected to double&lt;/a&gt; by the year 2060. And the economic burden of unpaid dementia caregiving in the U.S. is expected to skyrocket from an average of $172 billion in 2020 to over $1.5 trillion by 2060.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And this doesn’t take into account the emotional toll on families, friends and caregivers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there is currently no cure for dementia, taking &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activity-to-limit-for-reduced-risk-dementia-8548330" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt; can be a wise move. Columbia University researchers wanted to know which nutrients were related to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-factors-reduce-early-dementia-risk-new-study-8423035" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;—and which ones might increase the risk. They recently published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing U.S. study conducted biennially since 1992 that includes adults 50 years and older. In 2013, food consumption and nutrition intake was collected from a subset of the HRS called the Healthcare and Nutrition Study (HCNS).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate diet, participants completed a food frequency questionnaire that asked how frequently they consumed 163 different foods and beverages over the past 12 months. From this, the research team calculated nutrient intake based on participants’ responses for 101 nutrients. Individual nutrients were assessed regarding their relationship to dementia. In addition, researchers calculated composite scores for some groups of nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants’ cognitive abilities were assessed using two different methods. One method was via a telephone interview with participants and the other was via a proxy respondent. For the proxy method, someone close to the participant answered questions about the participant’s memory levels, limitations in instrumental activities of daily living and status of cognitive impairment. Researchers would use this information to look for associations between nutrient intake and dementia risk.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This current study included 6,280 HCNS participants who met the researchers’ criteria, which included full diet information and cognitive assessments. Researchers also adjusted for demographic information like age, race, sex, BMI, education level, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, the results suggest that several nutrients were connected with a reduced risk of dementia. The five with the strongest association were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Isorhamnetin, a type of flavonol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manganese, a mineral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta-tocopherol and beta-tocotrienol, both forms of vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also adds to the mounting evidence that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high sugar intake&lt;/a&gt; is linked with a higher risk of dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With that said, it also showed some controversial associations between some other nutrients and higher dementia risk. We say controversial because they conflict with previous research or add to mixed results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, this study suggests a link between certain components in milk and an increased risk of dementia, including glycerophosphocholine and vitamin D, both of which have been shown to support brain health in other studies. Researchers note that more research needs to be done, and that it could be due to other components in the food, not necessarily these nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has several limitations. First, asking people to estimate how much they ate of certain foods over the last year leaves lots of room for bias, forgetfulness and guessing. Also, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive abilities and dementia&lt;/a&gt; were not clinically evaluated, which also leaves room for bias. Lastly, researchers did not adjust for factors like genetics and environmental factors that play a role in dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Isorhamnetin is a flavonol found in fruits and vegetables, including onions, almonds, berries, cherries, pears, apples and green grapes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also found in ginkgo biloba, an herb touted for its brain health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ll find manganese in nuts, legumes, whole grains and leafy greens. Maple syrup and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676558/what-is-maple-water-and-should-you-be-drinking-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maple water&lt;/a&gt; are also rich sources of this trace mineral. Manganese plays a role in many bodily processes, including metabolism and immunity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it’s a mineral, manganese plays a dual role and acts like an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage from free radicals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like manganese, vitamin E also has antioxidant properties, protecting cells from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and sunflower and safflower oils are good sources of vitamin E. You’ll also get some in spinach and broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A whopping &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nine out of 10 Americans&lt;/a&gt; don’t have enough fiber in their diets. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned that you’re not including enough of these nutrients in your day-to-day routine, consider shaking things up. An easy (and painless) way to do it is to swap out your typical snacks for nutrient-rich ones. For example, if you typically reach for chips, soda or a candy bar mid-afternoon, consider a handful of nuts and berries. Or how about some hummus and veggie sticks?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that certain nutrients, like vitamin E, manganese and isorhamnetin, all of which act like antioxidants, plus fiber, are linked with a lower risk of dementia. It also adds to existing evidence that high sugar intake may raise dementia risk. If possible, get these brain-protecting nutrients from food. If you have difficulty doing so, seek the advice of a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can help you integrate foods rich in these nutrients and determine if supplementation is a viable option for you.

&lt;p&gt;The unidentified resident returned from a recent trip to Europe with measles, becoming the state’s 15th case this year, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in measles cases in Colorado, the most the state has recorded in decades, comes after a deadly outbreak in Texas this year, and as other hot spots have emerged around the world for the highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected Boulder County resident was an adult who was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Two shots of the vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say people should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days — and consider avoiding public gatherings — if they visited the following exposure locations in Boulder and Denver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTD Flatiron Flyer between Denver and Boulder&lt;/strong&gt;, both ways, from 6:45 to 9:35 a.m. and 4:05 to 7:15 p.m. June 3, June 5 and June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Building&lt;/strong&gt;, 1400 16th St., Denver, from 8 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. June 3-6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Finch Coffee Shop&lt;/strong&gt;, 1490 16th St., Denver, from noon to 2:15 p.m. June 4 and June 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/strong&gt;, 1701 Wewatta St., Denver, from noon to 2:30 p.m. June 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosetta Hall&lt;/strong&gt;, 1109 Walnut St., Boulder, from 7:30 to 10:45 p.m. June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include a cough, runny nose, red eyes and a fever, with a red rash starting about four days after someone becomes contagious. People can begin to feel sick one to three weeks after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who feel ill after a possible exposure should call their health care provider or an urgent care center before seeking help, so the provider can reduce the risk the virus will spread to other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded at least eight measles cases tied to Denver International Airport and a Turkish Airlines flight that landed there with a contagious passenger on May 13. Other cases have been confirmed in Denver, Pueblo and Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;In a typical year, Colorado has two or fewer measles cases. The last time the state recorded more than 10 in a year was in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

That much smaller Y chromosome carries the SRY gene, which is the switch for testis development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 300 million years or so, this system has been working very well. Now, however, chatter in genetics circles hints that something is amiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the Y chromosome has been losing pieces of itself, and computer models suggest the last scraps could vanish in roughly 11 million years. This is no trivial matter, because what it holds – or drops – can sway everything from cancer risk to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mouse-with-two-dads-survives-to-adulthood-major-implications-for-same-sex-human-couples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how future humans reproduce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would that erase men from the planet, or would life simply shrug and invent a new plan? Rodents on remote islands and subtle changes inside aging human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; are now providing clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One story shows how a mammal kept producing males after its Y disappeared entirely. The other warns how men already pay a price when some of their cells drift away from the chromosome during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosome-fade-away"&gt;Y chromosome fade away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-pass-down-x-chromosomes-that-accelerate-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The X chromosome&lt;/a&gt; carries about 900 genes that do everything from wiring nerves to repairing DNA. Its partner, the Y, keeps only about 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparative work across mammals shows that, once our lineage split from the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-do-animals-balance-their-sex-chromosomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt; some 166 million years ago, the Y began dropping about five genes every million years. Run that line forward, and the ledger hits zero in 11 million years – a geological heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most biologists once chalked that outcome up to hype. After all, many species never shed their sex chromosomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea gained traction when researchers found the Japanese spiny rat and a few mole vole species thriving today without any Y at all. Somehow, they had rewired the traditional circuit for making testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rodents-changed-the-rules"&gt;Rodents changed the rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, scientists found a duplicated piece of DNA near a gene called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/sox9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SOX9&lt;/a&gt; in the spiny rat. Usually, another gene (SRY) turns SOX9 on to make male traits develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this rat, the new DNA copy does that job on its own – even without a Y chromosome – so a genetically female animal (XX) can still develop as male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the fragment into lab mice and testes still form. Evolution, it seems, can lay a new cable when the old one burns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That discovery hints that, should the human Y fizzle out one distant day, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifes-rules-natural-selection-change-significantly-often-daphnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt; could promote an alternative trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different populations might even settle on different triggers, eventually splitting into separate species that cannot interbreed. The idea sounds like science fiction, but the rodent reality shows it is genetically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosomes-and-men-s-health"&gt;Y chromosomes and men’s health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before any species-wide overhaul, countless men are already losing the Y chromosome cell by cell. Starting in their fifties, bone-marrow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/living-mouse-created-with-stem-cells-that-predate-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; sometimes mis-segregate it during division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting white-blood-cell lineages, missing their Y, multiply quietly. By 80 years old, more than 40 percent of men carry sizable pockets of this “mosaic loss of Y” in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking 1,153 Swedish men in their seventies and eighties, researchers found that those with the loss died 5.5 years earlier, suffered more solid tumors and heart disease, and faced a seven-fold rise in Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Walsh of the &lt;a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; then bred mouse blood stem cells without the Y chromosome and transplanted them. The recipients developed fibrosis, failing hearts, and early death, showing the loss is the culprit, not a bystander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-direct-link-to-the-immune-system"&gt;Direct link to the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gene on the Y chromosome called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UTY&lt;/a&gt; helps control the immune system. Without it, some immune cells stop working properly – one kind makes more scar tissue, and another becomes weaker, which helps cancer grow and spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, tumors grow twice as fast without the Y. In men, bladder cancers missing the Y chromosome are more dangerous – except they respond better to a certain kind of cancer treatment called checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture is complicated: a chromosome that underpins male development also tames inflammation and restrains tumors, yet its selective absence can make some drugs shine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicine and evolution rarely share the same bottom line. Natural selection prizes reproductive success over a lifetime, while clinicians care about the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-offsetting-y-chromosome-loss"&gt;Offsetting Y chromosome loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution, and certain industrial chemicals add extra DNA damage and accelerate the Y chromosome loss. Kicking tobacco, breathing cleaner air, and limiting exposure to mutagens therefore rank as simple defenses – all it takes is willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General habits that slow genomic wear – regular exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mediterranean-diet-may-be-a-fountain-of-youth-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean-style&lt;/a&gt; meals, and solid sleep – may also keep the Y chromosome in more cells for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifibrotic drugs cleared for lung disease are being tested to blunt heart damage from the loss. Oncologists already use chromosome status in bladder tumors to steer checkpoint therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As single-cell sequencing gets cheaper, your physical exam might soon include a “Y-loss score” beside cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese spiny rat proves that mammals can reinvent the rulebook after the ‘puny little chromosome’ disappears. That prospect keeps evolutionary biologists buzzing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the rodent’s triumph offers little comfort to a 60-year-old man whose marrow has already shed Y in a third of his white-blood-cell army. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Species-level salvation and individual-level hazard can coexist. That dichotomy – long-term adaptability versus immediate personal cost – will likely guide both medical practice and evolutionary debate in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Y chromosome is quirky but crucial. It shapes male development, steadies immunity, and may also be plotting its own disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the good news is that the practical advice is simple: dodge mutagens, stub out cigarettes, consider a mid-life test for loss, and keep an eye on new research as this chromosome writes its final chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go, men, you got this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00646-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 21:55:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPaHBHVUVBUVJoMU5NODVHOGRiMGhSZDBEd2Zrak5rYzVVX0lGOGNlMHloWlhBSGhzamRRZXJtS1M5cU9UM3RGSE9wM0NHWDRZYnZPR3dQRUZ0YVlyTFVqcVdSM0dEUGxpT25LMFh5N2tPVGZDUGp1elJmYjZXMnQybTR4NlJUd3k2d2tnbDloN3Y5TVR1XzZ6bWg0cjM</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，这种日常习惯可以将慢性背痛风险降低23 ％ - EatingWell | This Daily Habit May Lower Chronic Back Pain Risk by 23%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5tNjc5dFBQZUFiRTlRLVZCaWpPekt0V2wwaXRwR3Rqby1YeHNsd01laG9Tbk5jV2U3OGc2eTc3a1g4VVZzTGMwell3SUxrUXg5LUJqWWpGWW1TT1pPWHZyUU1UZFpJb0hqYUdj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lower back pain is a not-so-gentle reminder that we’re human, not indestructible machines. It can rear its ugly head after you’ve lifted something heavy or spent hours in a chair that feels like it belongs in medieval times. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, other times it’s a sharp jab, and occasionally it’s that frustrating combo of both. Unfortunately, lower back pain is a common issue that affects people of all ages and is a leading cause of discomfort and disability worldwide.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is one of the primary causes of ongoing pain and contributes to significant health care costs, especially in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not to mention, it is a very uncomfortable thing to experience.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at information from a large health project in Norway called the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) Study. More than 56,000 individuals were evaluated, and subjects came in for health checks and answered questions about their lifestyle and health between 2017 and 2019 to obtain baseline information. Later, between 2021 and 2023, these participants were invited to a follow-up study focused on COVID-19, and about 60% of them took part. Certain individuals were removed from the study to ensure accurate results, such as those missing specific data or already having chronic lower back pain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In what was called the HUNT4 study, 31,295 participants wore two small motion-tracking devices called accelerometers for a week to measure their physical activity. One device was placed on the thigh, and the other on the lower back. These devices tracked different types of movements and postures in short 5-second intervals. Walking was categorized into three types based on speed: slow, moderate and brisk. Days with no recorded activity, like sitting or walking, were excluded. The study calculated how much time participants spent walking each day on average, as well as their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/add-six-hours-longevity-study-8754775" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking intensity&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on how much energy different walking speeds required.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic lower back pain was evaluated using a simple set of questions. Participants were asked if they had experienced pain or stiffness in their muscles or joints lasting at least three months in the past year. If they said yes, they were then asked to specify where they felt the pain or stiffness. Those who indicated that the pain was in their lower back were classified as having chronic lower back pain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Results showed that people who walked more each day had a lower risk of developing chronic lower back pain. Those who walked for at least 78 minutes daily saw a reduced risk, with the greatest benefit observed in those walking 125 minutes or more per day. Specifically, compared with walking less than 78 minutes per day, those who walked more than 100 minutes per day had a 23% reduced risk of chronic lower back pain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This effect was even stronger and more consistent in individuals aged 65 and older when compared to younger people. Additionally, walking at a faster pace or higher intensity led to similar benefits, showing that individuals with a brisk walking intensity also experienced a reduced risk of back pain. These findings did not differ based on gender or other factors like age when considering walking intensity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For individuals walking less than the highest daily volume (under 125 minutes per day), the risk of chronic lower back pain decreased when their walking intensity was higher than 3.00 MET per minute. MET refers to the metabolic equivalent of task— However, for those walking the most (125 minutes or more daily), this relationship was less clear. Interestingly, the impact of walking intensity on chronic lower back pain risk appeared consistent across all levels of daily walking volume. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The relationship between how much you walk each day and your risk of developing chronic lower back pain isn’t straightforward. Generally, walking more reduces your risk, with the biggest benefits seen when walking up to about 100 minutes per day. If you walk more than that, the risk continues to decrease but at a slower rate. Similarly, the intensity of walking matters to some extent. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking at a moderate pace was linked to a lower risk of lower back pain, and walking faster didn’t necessarily add more benefits—in fact, it may slightly increase the risk. These findings suggest that both the amount and the intensity of daily walking play roles in reducing the risk of chronic lower back pain, but the benefits vary depending on how much and how fast you walk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When interpreting the results of this study, it's important to consider a few key limitations. Firstly, the researchers only measured daily walking and intensity over a short period, which may not capture changes over time. It’s also worth noting that this study is observational, so we can’t say for sure if certain walking habits cause lower back pain or are just associated with it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, there might still be some unaccounted influences the researchers couldn’t fully control for, but this analysis suggests these wouldn’t drastically affect the results. Lastly, participants were asked to recall their back pain over the past year, which might lead to some inaccuracies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're someone who experiences occasional back discomfort or wants to reduce the risk of chronic lower back pain, walking might be one of the simplest and most practical solutions to incorporate into your routine. For many, walking is a low-impact and accessible activity that doesn’t require any special equipment or gym membership. Whether it’s a brisk walk around your neighborhood, a stroll through a local park or running errands on foot, making walking a daily habit could contribute to better back health over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The great thing about the findings from this study is how achievable these goals are for everyday people. Even walking for around 100 minutes a day may make a noticeable difference, and you don’t have to do it all at once; breaking it into smaller walks throughout the day works just as well. Additionally, picking up the pace occasionally or including some brisk walking may enhance the benefits. Walking not only helps with back health but also supports overall well-being, from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-activity-for-heart-health-recommended-by-cardiologist-8419619" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improving cardiovascular fitness&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024858/walking-plan-to-reduce-stress/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing stress&lt;/a&gt;. Small changes like opting to take the stairs, parking farther away or taking walking breaks during your day may help make a big difference in the long term.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recent study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt; offers insights into the potential benefits of walking for reducing the risk of chronic lower back pain . By analyzing data from over 31,000 participants, researchers found that walking more each day (particularly up to 125 minutes) is linked to a lower risk of developing chronic lower back pain. Walking intensity also plays a role, with moderate to brisk walking showing added benefits for those not already walking the most. These findings are especially promising for older adults, as they seemed to experience the most consistent reductions in risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the takeaway is clear: regular walking, whether done in small increments or longer bouts, is an accessible and effective way to support back health. This aligns with walking's broader benefits for overall physical and mental well-being, making it an ideal activity for people of all ages and fitness levels. Although intensity and duration both matter, even modest increases in daily walking habits can make a difference.&lt;br&gt;

Using brain-wide recordings in preclinical models, scientists observed that autism-linked mutations affected how expectations are updated during decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models relied more heavily on frontal brain regions and less on sensory input, struggling to distinguish between predictable and unpredictable stimuli.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain-recording technology, the research team observed neurons across the entire brain to explore whether different genetic forms of autism share patterns and establish commonalities in neural responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that, despite genetic differences, various forms may show a similar unique pattern of brain activity — also known as a brain signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this research will serve as a stepping stone linking genetic differences and behavioral atypicalities,” said Jean-Paul Noel, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that preclinical models with autism-linked genetic mutations struggled to adjust their expectations —or their predicted state of the world in the immediate future — based on new information when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical models that could update their expectations more flexibly, they relied more heavily on the front part of the brain and less on sensory areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, their brains focused more on long-term expectation differences, but their sensory systems had trouble distinguishing between predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particular circuit this research uncovered appears to drive behavioral anomalies in all three preclinical models of autism tested. This feedback projection from frontal areas to visual cortex will be studied in more detail in subsequent projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust, Simons Foundation, National Institutes of Health [grant R00NS128075], a Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative Pilot Grant, the University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute and a Sloan Research fellowship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and Autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f899d58b95918c90b88d9596d69d9c8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexandra Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alexandra Smith – University of Minnesota&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01965-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Jean-Paul Noel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational psychiatry studies suggest that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inflexibly update their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we leveraged high-yield rodent psychophysics, extensive behavioral modeling and brain-wide single-cell extracellular recordings to assess whether mice with different genetic perturbations associated with ASD show this same computational anomaly, and if so, what neurophysiological features are shared across genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice harboring mutations in &lt;em&gt;Fmr1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt; show a blunted update of priors during decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with mice that flexibly updated their priors, inflexible updating of priors was associated with a shift in the weighting of prior encoding from sensory to frontal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, frontal areas in mouse models of ASD showed more units encoding deviations from the animals’ long-run prior, and sensory responses did not differentiate between expected and unexpected observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that distinct genetic instantiations of ASD may yield common neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

            A document the Department of Health and Human Services sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to change U.S. policy on covid vaccines cites scientific studies that are unpublished or under dispute and mischaracterizes others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            One health expert called the document “willful medical disinformation” about the safety of covid vaccines for children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it’s just not there,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mark-turrentine-32066" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Turrentine&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.

            Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the Trump administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency’s formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The HHS document meant to support Kennedy’s decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress who questioned the science and process behind his move, according to one federal official who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy’s announcement from the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Titled “Covid Recommendation FAQ,” the document distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished, medical experts say.

            HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News, “There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Under the study’s title is an alert that “it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.” Though the preprint was made available a year ago, it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000l3b6mexy48umn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FAQ supporting Kennedy’s decision claims that “post-marketing studies” of covid vaccines have identified “serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis” — conditions in which the heart’s muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000m3b6mytcf69j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            False claims that the 2024 preprint showed myocarditis and pericarditis only in people who received a covid vaccine, and not in people infected with covid, circulated on social media. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;study’s co-authors&lt;/a&gt; publicly rejected that idea, because the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the covid virus. The study also focused only on children and adolescents. The HHS document omitted numerous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993236/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is greater after contracting covid for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000n3b6m5va2ty2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the covid pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of covid vaccines were spaced further apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000o3b6m8x16x1hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O’Leary said, referring to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify,” he said.

            In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found “an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.” But the paper doesn’t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000r3b6m8l7lpzj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere,” said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000s3b6m7rkrmviu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If he were grading the HHS document, “I would give this an ‘F,’” Turrentine said. “This is not supported by anything and it’s not using medical evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000t3b6mahkdmtpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “They’re going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document,” Silverman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Schrier’s office did receive a copy of the document.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000v3b6m04p2ohkp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don’t have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart,” O’Leary said. “But this one — I’ve seen much better anti-vaccine propaganda than this, frankly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000w3b6mwahzdy4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration’s policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000x3b6mxxuyaefn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This feels like it’s breaking new ground. I don’t think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration,” Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            On June 4, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Schrier &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr3701/BILLS-119hr3701ih.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would require Kennedy to adopt official vaccine decisions from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Young said the motivation behind the bill was Kennedy’s decision to change the covid vaccine schedule without the input of ACIP’s vaccine experts, who play a key role in setting CDC policies around vaccine schedules and access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000z3b6mkvy7hltk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy announced June 9 on X that he would remove all 17 members of ACIP, citing alleged conflicts of interest he did not detail, and replace them. He announced eight replacements June 11, including people who had criticized vaccine mandates during the covid pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
