         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8ltsu00d82cpe4emp4ixg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week made his strongest endorsement yet of the measles vaccine amid an ongoing outbreak that has killed three and infected more than 600 people across the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qh00023b6om03vv4h2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;recent push&lt;/a&gt; for people to get vaccinated for measles stands in stark contrast to Kennedy’s years of work against measles vaccines, including suing the state of New York for its vaccine mandates, and making numerous claims that the shot is dangerous and unnecessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00033b6otdssjch7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;comments on X&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, “is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” set off vaccine critics who saw the statement as a betrayal of the health secretary’s longtime views on vaccine safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00043b6ov1zbi0cu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Bobby Kennedy was our founder, but Bobby Kennedy is now the Secretary of HHS,” Mary Holland, CEO of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, said in a video statement. “He certainly left off that in my personal experience, and in the personal experience of many people at CHD, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine was extremely injurious.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00053b6oenstuw38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland went on to repeat disproven claims that the MMR vaccine causes autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00063b6o2lgu5iiw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The health secretary followed up this Thursday with a Fox News interview, where he told host Martha MacCallum that it is “very hard to tell” whether measles deaths this year could have been averted with vaccinations. “We need to do better at treating kids who have this disease, and not just saying the only answer is vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00073b6onnjx5zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also discussed the health agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes/index.html"&gt;“massive research and testing” plan&lt;/a&gt; to find the causes of autism by this September, a project he said will probe vaccinations along with environmental exposures, food and societal factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00083b6ovd7ren4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Kennedy has been most critical of Covid-19 vaccines in recent years, MMR immunizations have been one of his earliest and most consistent targets for misinformation and alarm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;over the last two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00093b6olujpgkws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN reached out to HHS for comment regarding Kennedy’s past and recent remarks on MMR vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000a3b6ow0d05k65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Kennedy wrote in his 2023 book with Brian Hooker, Vax-Unvax, “The MMR vaccine is the tip of the spear regarding the modern debate around vaccine safety.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000b3b6o6sl8h55q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are three ways Kennedy questioned the vaccine’s safety and the severity of measles infections themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000d3b6oaygtqxye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The theory that MMR vaccines led to autism first took hold with a since-retracted 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield. As the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/24/autism.vaccine.doctor.banned/index.html"&gt;disbarred British physician&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence in the anti-vaccine world, so did Kennedy — who repeatedly defended his debunked research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000e3b6osuqtuggd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wakefield [and his co-researchers] did not state that MMR causes autism,” Kennedy and Hooker wrote in their 2023 book. “They merely pointed out the timing of the vaccine before the onset of symptoms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000f3b6ospe7d9o7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten of the 12 co-authors on the study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)15715-2/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;issued a retraction&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, saying it established no causal link between the MMR shot and autism. Infants with autism typically start showing signs between 12-24 months of age; the first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given when a child is 12 months old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000g3b6of0agqx8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, like Wakefield, has asserted over the years that MMR vaccines lead to myriad adverse events besides autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000h3b6ofbapf1kn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            MMR vaccines have an “unconscionably high injury rate” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-response-to-the-message-of-measles-what-the-new-yorker-wouldnt-publish/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on CHD’s website&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, citing gastrointestinal and respiratory complications from a mid-1970s study. Those are symptoms “that might persuade rational consumers to choose the infections over the vaccine,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000i3b6ojn60p8fz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This March, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank"&gt;speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy repeated the claim that the vaccines themselves are as risky at the virus. “[The MMR vaccine] causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes,” and leads to “deaths every year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000j3b6ouswa0bu3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are no reported deaths from the vaccine among healthy people, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;Infectious Disease Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000l3b6of4scso2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has repeatedly said that measles outbreaks are not unusual, infection is not severe in healthy people, and deaths with measles are due to other causes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000m3b6oqsjfvqvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you look at the kids in Africa who die from measles, or these other infectious diseases, they’re all malnourished,” he said on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LJXPOv4SM" target="_blank"&gt;Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; in June 2023. “It’s hard for a disease to kill a healthy person; it’s hard for an infectious disease to kill a healthy person with a rugged immune system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000n3b6ogdxquuxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health departments reported &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;no underlying health conditions&lt;/a&gt; reported in the three US deaths this year, the first measles deaths in the country in a decade. All three, two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico, were unvaccinated. In the Fox interview Thursday, Kennedy suggested at least one of the children had prior medical complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000o3b6ogfcz2qxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also this year dismissed the notion that many died from measles in a 2019 Samoan outbreak that killed 83 and infected more than 5,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000p3b6oldodpf5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Details of Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/politics/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-samoa-digvid"&gt;visit to Samoa&lt;/a&gt; months before the 2019 outbreak resurfaced during his Senate confirmation hearings. He went to the country &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/lsamoa-medical-freedom-hero-court-case-dismissed/" target="_blank"&gt;following an invitation&lt;/a&gt; from an anti-vaccine advocate, but denies he campaigned against vaccination while he was there. He also denied to senators that dozens of people died from the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000q3b6o0d2i3lmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the people did not have measles,” when tissue samples were tested, he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) “We don’t know what was killing them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000r3b6o07t9q5ea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That claim is a “total fabrication,” Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474" target="_blank"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Ekeroma also said Kennedy met with anti-vaccine advocates while there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000t3b6o7zydky14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, along with former federal prosecutor Michael Sussman, sued the state of New York in 2019 to oppose vaccine requirement for school-age children. The state’s legislature passed the law, which removed religious exemptions, amid a measles outbreak that year among Brooklyn’s Orthodox Jewish community that infected nearly 800 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000u3b6o9nuzf1os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A state Supreme Court justice rejected the suit days later. The Kennedy-chaired Children’s Health Defense vowed to keep fighting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000v3b6oe086z78i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same year, Kennedy rallied with Washington state residents against a MMR vaccine mandate for children attending school. At the time, there were roughly 50 reported measles cases in the state. It spread to 71 people, most of them unvaccinated children, during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a5.htm" target="_blank"&gt;monthslong outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000w3b6oder5mnch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As health secretary, Kennedy has maintained that position that vaccination should be a choice despite the spread of measles across 23 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000x3b6omwegd64z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt; April 8. “I always said during my campaign — and every part, every public statement I’ve made — I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”

This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The focus was on their healing," Mr Holbrooks said. "You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country's worst measles outbreaks in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The US has seen more than 700 cases this year. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak. Two children, including Daisy, have died - the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;first recorded fatalities from measles in the US since 2015.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's not slowing down either, public health experts say. They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual and with mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy who has endorsed immunization conspiracy theories in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine," Mr Holbrooks said. "We can put messaging out, but it's up to them to come see us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The South Plains public health director, Zach Holbrooks, is trying to reach vaccine-hesitant communities through messaging and public advertisements&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Going about' life in a measles epicentre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Among billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Roughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity, when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began immigrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergartners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, said Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group, the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Savannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Like many in Seminole, Jessica Giesbrecht (left) and Savannah Knelsen (right) have opposing views on vaccination &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5 F (40.2 C), but still chose not to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body "fight off" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Knelsen's 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm worried for my baby niece," Ms Giesbrecht said, adding she was too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, the two said the outbreak doesn't weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. "People are just going about their lives," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Texas has had over 500 cases of measles, most concentrated in rural western counties &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy tries to 'cover middle ground'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the 8-year-old girl's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - he has in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunizations, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it "not unusual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Trump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a "fairly small number of people" had been impacted, when he was asked by the BBC about the outbreak aboard Air Force One. It was "not something new", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News, "The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government "should not be mandating" vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Vitamin A is sometimes used to help treat measles - but should not be given without a physician's guidance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children's Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had used it a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People look to their leaders to lead," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Jeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy's former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to "cover the middle ground", providing statements that are "politically adequate" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In covering the middle ground, I'm not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns," Mr Hutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Slashing funds in an outbreak zone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Trump administration's health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say. Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4b (£8.8) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it deployed the "necessary" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, said spokesperson Chris Van Deusen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I don't think they have the funds," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Trusted messengers'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Local officials have seen some success in measles vaccination clinics, but hope even more will get vaccinated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In nearby Lubbock, Texas, just two days after the news of Daisy's death, all was quiet at the health department's vaccination clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other days have been busier, with as many as 20 people coming in for vaccines, said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city, where hospitals receive children with severe measles cases from more rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the outbreak began in January, the city of Seminole has vaccinated 103 adults and 143 children against the measles, Mr Holbrooks said. The neighbouring three rural counties decided to close their underused vaccine clinics and send more staff to hard-hit Seminole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's always talk on, what else can we do, and are we doing enough?" Mr Holbrooks said.

As temperatures rise, many regions – especially the US, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/all.13758" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and Australia – are seeing seasonal allergies affect an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP173" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;increasing proportion of people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12755" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;over a longer season&lt;/a&gt; and with worse symptoms, say scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Pollen itself is an essential and ever-present part of our world. These microscopic particles pass between plants, enabling them to reproduce. While some plants spread their pollen with the help of insects, others rely on the wind, sending huge volumes of this powdery substance airborne. Many trees, grasses and weed species rely upon wind dispersal for their pollen. It is these that are especially likely to cause seasonal allergies, or hay fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response normally reserved for pathogenic bacteria or viruses. Common symptoms can include a runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. In some cases, seasonal allergies can trigger breathing difficulties when inflammation in the airways leads to swelling, making it hard to get enough air into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed responded.

The leading theory is that cold air downdrafts that occur during thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds that blow at ground level, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/18/thunderstorm-asthma-and-public-health-looking-back-to-move-forward/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;whipping up pollen grains and fungal spores from grass and plants&lt;/a&gt;. These then get carried high into the storm system by updrafts, where moisture in the clouds causes them to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cea.12709" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;swell and break apart into smaller fragments&lt;/a&gt;, massively increasing the number of allergen particles in the air. The strong electric field that develops during thunderstorms may also enhance the rupture of the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Thankfully, major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare. But climate change is increasing people's risk of pollen exposure in other ways, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For one thing, rising temperatures mean that pollen seasons – when plants emit pollen, typically during spring and summer – are starting earlier and lasting longer, says Elaine Fuertes, a public health scientist who focuses on the environment and allergic disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, UK. "You're going to get people who experience symptoms earlier in the year, for a longer period of time," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In parts of the world, including the US and Europe, one of the key culprits is ragweed – a widespread group of flowering plants that many people consider to be weeds. There are various species of ragweed around the world but they can produce mind-bending amounts of pollen. A single plant is capable of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-allergy/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;emitting one billion pollen grains&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Ragweed grows in gardens and farmland but also in nooks and crannies in urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Allergies to ragweed pollen already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-pollen/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;affect some 50 million people in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;. A study analysing data from 11 locations in North America between 1995 to 2015 found that 10 of those locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons – sometimes much longer. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ragweed-pollen-season" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;During that 20-year period&lt;/a&gt;, the season lengthened by 25 days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 days in Fargo, North Dakota and 18 days in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The winter warms, the springs are starting earlier, and the falls are being delayed, and so the time that you spend outdoors in contact with allergic pollen is definitely going up," says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University, in New York, US, and one of the scientists who researched the ragweed pollen season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These changes get more drastic in northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia, Ziska says.

It is also that the amount of allergens in the air are increasing in many parts of the world. In the 2000s, the pollen season in the continental US started three days earlier than it did during the 1990s, but crucially, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.12755" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the amount of pollen in the air was also 46% higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is partly because carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere are rising, due to emissions from human activities. And many of the most bothersome plants for hay fever sufferers thrive on CO2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111712" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;grew a certain type of grass&lt;/a&gt; under different CO2 levels, for example, they found that plants grown in an atmosphere containing CO2 at 800 parts per million (ppm) had flowers that produced about 50% more pollen than plants grown in air containing 400ppm.

His results mirror those of other researchers. "Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed plants responded. They grew more. They produced more pollen," he says.

Already, some 60% of people in Hungary, 20% in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/30447-ragweed-allergy-on-the-rise-in-europe" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;are reportedly sensitive to the pollen&lt;/a&gt; from this prolific group of plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images With the amount of pollen in the air increasing due to climate change, scientists predict that seasonal allergies will also worsen (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;With the amount of pollen in the air increasing due to climate change, scientists predict that seasonal allergies will also worsen (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;About one-third of the increase is due to the continuing spread of the invasive species, the researchers note. The remaining two-thirds is specifically due to climate change, including the lengthening of the growing season as temperatures warm. "So it'll be an earlier season, a longer season, as well as a more intense season for those who experience allergic symptoms – and then a higher risk of new sensitisation for a previously unexposed population," Fuertes says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Not every region in the world will see more pollen production. Some researchers have found that southern California, for example, will experience earlier &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/1461/2014/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;but less productive pollen seasons&lt;/a&gt;, largely as a result of reduced rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Relatively speaking, the amount of pollen in the air will still vary from year to year, Fuertes points out. But that may not be of much help to hay fever sufferers. "Once you're sensitised and go on to develop allergic symptoms, you'll still likely experience symptoms during years when pollen levels may be lower than average," she says. "You'll react to the pollen that's around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, what can people do about this? Cutting carbon emissions would help to avert some of the worst climate impacts and other strategies might also mitigate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It might be possible to make some drastic but direct interventions, for example. A century ago, some US cities even set up commissions to tackle ragweed. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1932/08/12/archives/chicago-employs-1350-in-hay-fever-fight-jobless-used-to-cut-down.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;"Chicago employs 1,350 in hay fever fight,"&lt;/a&gt; blares one headline from 1932. The news story explains that men – otherwise unemployed during the Great Depression – were paid the equivalent of one week's food and lodging (and "25 cents in cash") for each day they spent cutting down the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Planting of tree species that produce less allergy-inducing airborne pollen is one way cities can help sufferers (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Planting of tree species that produce less allergy-inducing airborne pollen is one way cities can help sufferers (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other solutions lie in smarter urban design. "We should definitely green our cities," Fuertes says. "But we do need to do it thoughtfully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is also important to monitor and forecast pollen levels, scientists say. "We need to know what we're breathing in. That's a pretty fundamental thing in terms of our health," says Beggs, who points out that while most people take it for granted that they can get reliable, real-time, validated information on metrics like temperature or rainfall in their area, relatively few can say the same for airborne allergens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But even those services that are modelling pollen counts in an extensive, detailed way – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03686-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute&lt;/a&gt; – aren't monitoring or modelling airborne allergen levels, which are more accurate as each pollen grain can release different amounts of allergens and they can vary by the weather conditions. These are a different measurement, Fuertes points out, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(23)01469-0/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;one that she's shown is more closely linked to allergy symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. "Nobody is measuring allergen levels on a routine basis," Fuertes says. "We should be moving towards that."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall, experts say, the science is clear. Without concrete, coordinated action, climate change will continue to make hay fever worse across many regions of the world. This might include more dramatic, deadly events like thunderstorm asthma. But it might also mean more people sniffling and suffering, for a longer season, every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have the studies now to show that it's really having an impact on human health," says Beggs.

              &lt;p&gt;At 42, Dr. Darshan Shah was used to being stressed. As a successful surgeon based in Los Angeles, he had spent 20 years regularly working 12-hour days, starting at 6 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when his wife got pregnant with their first child in 2016, he realized he needed to make a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;change to be healthier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I found myself in a state of poor health. I had developed an autoimmune disease, I was 50 pounds overweight, I had high blood pressure that could not be controlled with medication, I had high cholesterol, and lots of risk factors for an early death," Shah, 52, told Business Insider. "But my son had a long life ahead of him, and I wanted to be around for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah took a year off from being a surgeon and began researching the science behind &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-simple-habits-add-decades-onto-to-your-life-research-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;long-term health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"I was able to completely turn my health around and completely come off 10 different prescription medications within a year. I lost 50 pounds, and my autoimmune disease completely disappeared," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus improved at work, too, and he found that he was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-self-care-tips-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;no longer tired&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he "wanted to wake up every morning and jump out of bed to attack the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah's transformation made him realize this was the type of medicine he wanted to practice — helping people &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-habits-fit-throughout-life-personal-trainer-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;get and stay healthy&lt;/a&gt; rather than just addressing medical issues as they arise. In 2016, he founded Next Health, a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-clinic-owner-reversed-biological-age-daily-routine-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;health optimization&lt;/a&gt; and longevity clinic with locations across the US and in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Shah does experimental longevity treatments at his clinics, but he still thinks that getting the basics right, as he did, is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/things-longevity-scientist-centenarians-does-for-live-longer-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;key for a long, healthy life&lt;/a&gt;.

I was eating a lot of ultra-processed food, especially highly processed carbohydrates," Shah said, so he eliminated them from his diet.&lt;/p&gt;

A 2022 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004109" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; conducted on over 10,000 British civil service workers found that participants who reported getting less than five hours of sleep a night at the age of 50 had a higher risk of developing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and dying from long-term health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sleep-more-cut-calories-without-dieting-study-suggests-2022-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; is also associated with eating fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Shah sleeps for seven hours a night and says he feels amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

He goes to the gym every other day to do a routine that is 70% strength training using free weights, and 30% cardio, for which he runs on a treadmill — plus some stretching to warm up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah also tries to get up and move every 45 minutes when he's at work to break up periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They say that sitting is the new smoking, and I think that's true," Shah said. "As a surgeon, you spend a lot of time either standing or sitting in one position, and that sedentary non-movement leads to a high risk of disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows that sitting for longer than 10 hours a day is associated with a higher risk of dying early, a 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/22/1457" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of about 12,000 people over the age of 50, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, suggests a solution. It found that 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a day — such as doing housework, brisk walking, or cycling — appeared to offset the negative &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-exercise-prevent-death-sitting-all-day-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;effects of being sedentary all day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Cleveland Clinic, eating a healthy diet, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding excessive alcohol and drug use can help to keep testosterone levels normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BI previously reported, once considered taboo, growing numbers of men are doing &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-men-testosterone-therapy-masculine-ideal-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;testosterone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; without an official diagnosis of "low testosterone," to help them build muscle, get erections, and have more energy.

Another part comes from their nutrient-packed profile, which seems to support a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eight-healthy-lifestyle-habits-could-extend-your-life-by-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their popularity has led researchers to look deeper into what happens when these fruits are made a daily habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigating different dietary approaches, a notable study gained attention for its focus on the potential of one avocado per day to enhance overall diet quality and encourage healthier eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-avocados-the-study"&gt;Eating avocados – the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Kristina Petersen and retired Professor Penny Kris-Etherton from Penn State University’s &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Nutritional Sciences&lt;/a&gt; led an effort that put a spotlight on how a single daily avocado could affect everyday food choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work provides a window into how simple additions to meals might improve nutritional habits without major overhauls to what people eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their publication in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; examined how a straightforward intervention could lead to better adherence to dietary guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes at a time when many are looking for ways to improve their health through small but meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-following-the-guidelines"&gt;Following the guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,008 adults participated in the investigation. Researchers gathered details about what everyone ate through telephone interviews that involved 24-hour dietary intake data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tracked how closely each individual stuck to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; by using the Healthy Eating Index as a yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were split into two groups over 26 weeks. One group continued with their existing patterns but limited avocados, while the other added one avocado daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since only about 2% of American adults &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-fruit-can-protect-you-from-late-life-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eat this fruit regularly&lt;/a&gt;, the project offered new information on how avocados might fit into many different diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-they-learned-about-eating-avocados"&gt;What they learned about eating avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who enjoyed a daily avocado experienced a meaningful shift in their diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avocados are a powerhouse of nutrition, and our objective was to ascertain if their regular consumption could boost diet quality,” explained Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators noticed that this single change had an influence on how individuals approached meals, with greater emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-foods-with-these-key-nutrients-will-dramatically-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrient-rich items&lt;/a&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This improvement suggests that simple strategies like daily avocado consumption can significantly enhance diet quality,” said Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also uncovered one more result that caught their attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The substitution effect we observed is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates avocados’ potential in replacing higher-calorie, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breaking-free-from-ultra-processed-foods-the-surprising-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less nutritious foods&lt;/a&gt;,” Petersen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By fostering better compliance with dietary guidelines, we can substantially lower the risk of chronic conditions and improve overall health outcomes,” said Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to avocados as a practical avenue for people interested in following established nutrition recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By emphasizing basic, tasty items, this fruit may spark positive steps toward heart health, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/type-2-diabetes-heightens-alzheimers-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; management, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados contain fiber and beneficial fats, which contribute to a satisfying feeling after a meal. That quality might support strategies that keep a person on track when planning or cooking dinner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time they are used in place of sodium-heavy or refined-grain foods, the odds of maintaining a balanced diet appear to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-avocados-a-short-history"&gt;Eating avocados – a short history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados, known by the scientific name &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Persea americana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, have a long history traced to Mexico and Central America. Indigenous peoples domesticated this fruit well over 10,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, they introduced avocados to Europe, setting the stage for their eventual spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name “avocado” comes from the Nahuatl word “ahuacatl.” The shape of the fruit may have inspired that original term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the origin, the popularity of this versatile item continues to climb, with new dishes popping up in cafes and restaurants everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nutritional-details"&gt;Nutritional details&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are recognized for their monounsaturated fats, which may help reduce bad cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be good news for heart health, especially when combined with a balanced approach to other foods. They also contain an impressive amount of potassium, which supports &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/relaxation-techniques-can-lower-high-blood-pressure-at-least-temporarily/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people notice how avocados fit into a weight-management plan. They are known to help individuals feel satisfied, so there is less temptation to grab a snack soon after a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of fiber helps maintain a steady flow through the digestive system, possibly providing an extra advantage for everyday wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sustainability-considerations"&gt;Sustainability considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regions face pressure to keep up with the rising demand for this fruit. Farms require a fair amount of water, and shipping them long distances can raise concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/biotic-homogenization-human-impacts-diminish-biodiversity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ecological footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making choices that align with sustainable sources is one way to reduce any negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers have started exploring new farming methods to preserve soil and use resources more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness of these efforts can be beneficial for those who want to enjoy avocados while showing respect for the environment at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-ve-learned-about-eating-avocados"&gt;What we’ve learned about eating avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Penn State findings shine a spotlight on how a modest change might be enough to elevate meal quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though these results are encouraging, continued exploration may uncover additional food-based strategies that fit different lifestyles or dietary needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small steps hold promise for those seeking to improve their daily habits. A simple addition in the kitchen can open the door to better eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados have stood out as a delicious candidate that suits many palates, which makes it easier to stick with a plan over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2475299124000052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:06:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRXJqWXZ3N3VnUzgwODdGdEJUTld1SWNxSUNzQ09ScldVeXp3MkZkSHpaV3lzb0NXWC1PYzlkMHhzTUFpYUVEYnphNThsNzdkTXJEYmp3RFJRMFVKVU5NcTV5ZGFncHY2YktmV2FlRk5DanNLOXpWUkltbE02UjVVUWVUSTM5b3lpaTFXVW0xcHVUcEwwaVc1bldVaklKeXpNdDVRUA</guid></item><item><title>As a lifelong insomniac, can magnesium really help me sleep? - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDFnZFFNWFJvT0VKUTJsUlhKN1hyaVBEQkZqNWpjWkdxbTBhUm9iUDNsVWlKMjN0TlVCeXdZY1E3Y1BCLWJQdDljSDhleUViR1hUV0Q4TW9LcGxJMGxiYnZNNllrQVBHX2VLSE42a2FZRm51ekVnaE4yODFHWWxXOENhY21TODVtbWxZQnVwYTZIRkJ6MDc5Vi1oWFh3U1RGX29id3QwX1N2NHhMVFFIQkJMcmUwSEdINWhqMQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As a lifelong insomniac, usually found staring at the ceiling at 3am at least three times a week, who has tried everything from prescription sleeping pills to herbal tea via hypnosis to nod off, magnesium was one of the few remedies I hadn’t explored, both because I wasn’t convinced by the evidence and because I am a&lt;span&gt; supplement sceptic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My diet was already healthy, I reasoned, so why contribute to an unregulated supplement industry worth an estimated £138 billion worldwide?

Fast-forward seven weeks and, barring four occasions when I last recall looking at the clock at 1am, I have slept for six uninterrupted hours every night — by far the longest stretch of quality kip I have experienced in my entire adult life.

Most — 60 per cent — of our body’s magnesium is found in our bones, the rest in the muscles, the brain, soft tissues and fluids including blood. “Magnesium deficiency can increase the risk of developing several chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, dementia and osteoporosis,” Dr Sophie Bostock, founder of the website The Sleep Scientist, who helped the NHS develop its clinically proven sleep improvement programme Sleepio, says. But it is its connection with sleep that interests her most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How does magnesium affect sleep? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium is believed to help sleep by regulating neurotransmitters, which help to “control how stress affects the body”, Bostock says. It assists the production of the “feelgood” neurotransmitter serotonin, activates gamma aminobutyric acid receptors that help to prevent overstimulation, reduces production of the stress hormone cortisol, encourages production of the hormone melatonin (which regulates our circadian rhythm) and helps to dilate our blood vessels so the body releases heat. “We need a temperature drop to fall asleep,” Dr Kat Lederle, a sleep specialist who is also at the London General Practice, explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate for a magnesium-rich diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you’re eating a healthy diet it should be easy to meet the NHS guidelines of 300mg magnesium a day for men and 270mg for women without a supplement. Good food sources include nuts, brown rice, fish, meat, dairy products, leafy green vegetables and dark chocolate. Magnesium is often added to breakfast cereals and is abundant in pumpkin seeds (a 28g serving contains 156mg). However, one 2018 study found that 48 per cent of American adults were deficient, and meeting guidelines doesn’t necessarily mean you’re getting enough of the mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-sleep-better-good-nights-sleep-lpw6vfskn" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get a good night’s sleep — and the real reasons you’re not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Age, exercise and alcohol can affect magnesium levels &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A true vitamin or mineral deficiency is when blood levels of a substance are low, Dallas says. In the 18 months she’s been running a menopause clinic at her practice, only one out of hundreds of women has tested as magnesium deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, Bostock says a blood test for deficiency is problematic because only a small amount of magnesium is stored in the blood, while the majority of magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues. Further complicating the issue of whether you may be deficient, she adds, is the fact that symptoms that could be attributed to magnesium deficiency,such as tiredness, irritability or anxiety, “can obviously have other causes”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;High salt, caffeine and alcohol consumption can impede our ability to retain magnesium, as can endurance exercise because we excrete magnesium through sweat and use more for muscle function. Last year, a systematic review in the Journal of Translational Medicine found that those who did intense exercise require 10 to 20 per cent more magnesium than sedentary people. Falling oestrogen levels during perimenopause, meanwhile, can reduce absorption, while stress has been found to “increase the rate of excretion of magnesium into the urine”, Bostock says. Dallas recommends that perimenopausal women and those who exercise a lot take a supplement. As a 46-year-old who works out every day and often feels stressed, I see why I might have been not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Can a supplement really help? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The science is uncertain. One study of 46 adults found that taking a magnesium supplement a day for eight weeks improved total sleep time and sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep). Bostock points out, however, that “although [participants] fell asleep faster, they still took over an hour to fall asleep at the end of the trial. It wasn’t a miracle cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.17"&gt;&lt;div id="facad8fb-98b1-4d7b-9c5d-9430bdb23b18"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Magnesium is not a sleeping pill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2023 systematic review of 7,582 people found an observational association between magnesium intake and better sleep. “It can improve sleep efficiency, though evidence is still limited,” Dallas says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lederle cites a 2021 review that found that taking a magnesium supplement helped people to fall asleep 17 minutes faster, but asks, “What’s the practical value?” In other words, whether our sleep will increase by enough to actively improve how rested we feel the next day has not yet been proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/better-sleep-foods-to-eat-pr5x3npzz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The food to eat for better sleep — and what’s keeping you awake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Why are there so many different forms of magnesium?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium can’t be taken in pure form as a supplement — it is combined with another substance and the different types supposedly offer different benefits. They include magnesium orotate (magnesium bound with orotic acid), linked to improved heart health, and magnesium taurate (magnesium bound with taurine), which research has shown may promote healthy blood pressure. Magnesium citrate, bound with citric acid, and magnesium glycinate, which I have been taking — a compound of magnesium with glycine, an amino acid itself linked to improved sleep in animal studies — are among the most easily absorbed and are marketed to improve sleep, although no study has yet proved their efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The biggest buzz surrounds magnesium L-threonate — magnesium and L-threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from vitamin C — which the Stanford neuroscientist Dr Andrew Huberman has recommended for improved sleep, and which animal research suggests may be the best way of improving magnesium concentration in brain cells. “It’s the only form that effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, offering superior brain bioavailability,” Dallas, who takes it herself, says. But Bostock says there is limited evidence that it improves sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium oxide (magnesium and oxygen) has been used in most trials to date and is by far the most budget friendly — I was excited to see an own-label Morrisons pack of 45 for £3 in my local supermarket. But it has been shown to be the least absorbent and is more commonly used to treat indigestion and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dallas suggests taking magnesium L-threonate, glycinate or citrate for sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-d-b12-magnesium-how-much-per-day-v7qxxsq7r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you getting enough Vitamin D, B12 and magnesium?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Are more expensive supplements any better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The difference in price typically varies according to brand rather than magnesium type and Dallas won’t speculate on why some are more expensive — but I’d wager an expensive marketing budget and celebrity ambassadors play a part. She does say that “expensive brands aren’t necessarily better”, but advises against cheap brands on Amazon “because you don’t know what’s in them”. My £12.95 Nobi Nutrition bottle from Amazon comes with a full list of ingredients, however, and has been third-party tested, which Dallas says to look for when choosing a supplement. Supplement dosage is measured in terms of the total weight of the magnesium compound, of which the element, or pure magnesium, is usually only a small percentage. The dose listed on a label will often sound high — mine is 400mg — but this is the total weight of the magnesium compound, in my case magnesium and glycine. The actual magnesium in each dose is usually much lower — in mine it’s 72mg, or 27 per cent of my recommended daily allowance. The amount absorbed will vary from person to person and “magnesium is a safe supplement”, Dallas adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Can a magnesium bath like Gwyneth’s work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There’s little evidence that magnesium sprays and creams can improve sleep, and while Epsom salts, a compound of magnesium sulphate — which Paltrow bathes in every night to get “all the energy of the day off” — are well documented as a sleep ritual, a 2017 review found bathing in it carried no significant benefits. “Some studies show taking it transdermally might work,” Lederle says, but there is “not sufficient” evidence and “too many variables. Popping a pill, [at least] you know what’s gone in.” For those who don’t like swallowing a supplement, magnesium gummies might be a better option, which Lenny Kravitz describes as “like I’m just eating candy”. He told New York magazine that he takes Natural Vitality’s Calm Magnesium Citrate Anti-Stress Gummies (£21.66 for 120, &lt;a href="https://www.naturalvitality.com/en-gb/collections/gummies?_pos=5&amp;amp;_psq=ma&amp;amp;_ss=e&amp;amp;_v=1.0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;naturalvitality.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Instant results? It’s probably the placebo effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some supplement brands suggest we take magnesium before bed and I find this a comforting ritual. However, Lederle says, “it’s not a sleeping pill. You don’t take it and feel sleepy. It works by taking it on a regular basis to build levels.” Bostock adds that “it’s likely that a supplement will only help if you’re correcting a deficiency, and it could take a few weeks. I don’t think we have enough evidence to know whether it can have acute benefits in a day or two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bostock suspects the speed and extent of sleep improvement reported by magnesium fans on social media suggests the placebo effect is “a more likely driver”. As she says: “If you believe something will help you sleep, your anxiety about not being able to sleep reduces and you fall asleep faster, and stay asleep for longer.” Given that I have slept better from day one, I suspect my more restful nights are the result of a combination of placebo and a corrected deficiency. But I’ll keep on taking it, for as long as it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDFnZFFNWFJvT0VKUTJsUlhKN1hyaVBEQkZqNWpjWkdxbTBhUm9iUDNsVWlKMjN0TlVCeXdZY1E3Y1BCLWJQdDljSDhleUViR1hUV0Q4TW9LcGxJMGxiYnZNNllrQVBHX2VLSE42a2FZRm51ekVnaE4yODFHWWxXOENhY21TODVtbWxZQnVwYTZIRkJ6MDc5Vi1oWFh3U1RGX29id3QwX1N2NHhMVFFIQkJMcmUwSEdINWhqMQ</guid></item><item><title>Nine ways to keep your brain healthy - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVzA1U0h5RTNLcEtzMmxfZXQzSm5DLXJ5R1RkM0lZZVNBUDhhLUdUYlBXR2dIQUhQbFdXdkxmUTRUTzlzS3ZseDhfeFREOUJQeXpoY0VJNFE4MFVaYlhHWjRndlBRNnN3R0gzLTRKZGFqaXNnbjZIRWp5WVdDOUpzcFlhaFNSVW9PSkV5NGctREFhSTZfTG1oSnpaQzc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 gJBkaT"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow do we best keep our brains healthy? According to Dr Sabine Donnai, founder of the Viavi longevity clinic, it is the small things we do every day that make the biggest difference to our brain health, preventing cognitive decline over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In fact, the latest research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/dementia-prevention-intervention-care" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;as many as 45 per cent of dementia cases could be delayed&lt;/a&gt; or prevented with help from some simple tweaks to our habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We are looking at marginal gains from changing aspects of our diet and daily activity as well as incorporating new habits,” she says. “It is never too late to start making these changes.” Here’s what she recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;1. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scientists from the University of Warwick, the University of Cambridge and&lt;span&gt; Fudan University in China who examined the food preferences of 181,990 UK adults with an average age of 70 found that people who ate a more balanced diet had better cognitive function and memory than those on a reduced-carb, high-protein or plant-based diet. Their findings, published in the journal Nature Mental Health, also showed the balanced eaters also had better “brain morphology”, defined as higher amounts of grey matter, the outermost layer of the brain, which is responsible for controlling movement, memory and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;2. Exercise daily, even if it’s just a walk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;People who are physically active are 20 per cent less likely to develop dementia than those who aren’t, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. “It doesn’t matter how you stay active but a combination of different types of exercise is probably best,” Donnai says. A daily walk is the best place to start, with a 2022 Jama Network study of 78,430 adults living in the UK showing that covering a daily total of 9,800 steps was optimal for lowering the risk of dementia but that even 3,800 steps a day at a faster pace led to a lower incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;3. Eat more berries (ideally organic)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study from King’s College London and the University of Reading published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that eating a handful of blueberries daily for three months led to benefits including improved memory and brain function in a group of healthy men and women aged 65 to 80. Donnai says that all berries are a great addition to a brain-healthy diet but that we should try to buy organic whenever possible. Last year an analysis of government figures by the campaign group Pesticide Action Network UK (Pan UK) found unwanted traces of the “for ever chemicals” PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which hang around in the body, to be present in 95 per cent of 120 samples of strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;4. Have a serving of leafy greens daily&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A daily serving of leafy green veg, such as spinach, kale, cabbage and lettuce, is a must for a healthy brain diet. In a study of 960 older people with memory problems, a team from Rush University in Chicago and the Tufts Human Nutrition Research Centre in Boston found that those who ate one serving daily of leafy greens had rates of cognitive decline equivalent to them being 11 years younger cognitively than those who ate the least. Leafy green vegetables are a rich source of brain-friendly nutrients including folate, nitrate and lutein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/eat-more-protein-brain-depression-dementia-xc8btxjvh" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat more protein: the new way to improve your brain function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;5. Take regular saunas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers from Finland reporting in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports showed that those who visited a sauna at least 2-3 times a week had a 53 per cent lower risk of being diagnosed with dementia over the following two decades than non-sauna users. Donnai says that regular saunas might help to lower inflammation levels in the body, a known risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;6. Eat more oily fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Fish is a source of essential omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA, key micronutrients that enhance and protect the brain. A study of healthy midlifers published by American researchers in the journal Neurology showed that those who ate a variety of fish and had higher concentrations of omega-3 fats in their bloodstream had better brain structure and cognitive health in their forties and fifties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;7. Drizzle olive oil on your meals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Drizzling olive oil on salads and pasta dishes is a good habit to get into,” Donnai says. It contains predominantly monounsaturated fatty acids including the potent oleic acid, which is known to reduce inflammation in the brain. A team of Harvard scientists reporting in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed that a daily teaspoon of olive oil was associated with a 12 per cent reduced risk of death from all causes, but highlighted the fact that there was also a connection between olive oil consumption and fewer deaths from degenerative brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;8. Cut out ultra-processed foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers at the University of Liverpool and the University of Cambridge, reporting in the Journal of Neurology last year, concluded that a “high UPF consumption is associated with dementia”. A previous study involving 72,083 people from the UK Biobank cohort also found that those consuming more UPFs over ten years were at a greater risk of dementia. According to these researchers, highly processed diets tend to have low levels of nutrients, too much sugar and sodium, and may lead to inflammation, which can be bad for brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-avoid-microplastics-brain-bottled-water-23fr6pl58" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to avoid microplastics in your brain? Here’s how you could&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;9. Protect your blood-brain barrier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a semi-permeable membrane that acts as a filter to keep harmful substances such as toxins and chemicals away from the brain. The BBB works well when fully intact but can be easily weakened by inflammation, smoking, pollution, head injury and acute or long-term illness such as hypertension and diabetes, which can damage blood vessels, including those that make up the BBB. If the BBB becomes defective it can speed up the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau proteins, accelerating cognitive decline. However, there are many things we can do to preserve it. “Simple steps such as avoiding chemicals and additives as much as you can in cosmetics, cleaning products and food are helpful,” Donnai says. “Exercising daily and reducing stress in your life are also key steps to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p

by mimicking&lt;/a&gt; two hormones called GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in appetite suppression, increased production of insulin, greater insulin sensitivity and a reduction in the rate at which food is

The medication is available for weight loss to some people on the NHS and it can also be bought privately with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists at Eli Lilly, the company that makes Mounjaro, along with academic researchers have released two analyses of data from a three-year trial known as Surmount-1, throwing fresh light on the medication’s longer-term use. One analysis looked at trajectories of weight loss, the second at rebound after initial weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results, which are to be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga next month and have yet to be peer reviewed, are based on data from about 700 participants who took tirzepatide in three different dose regimens during the 176-week study.

The team said the final average body weight reductions for these groups were 9.2%, 20.2% and 30.8% respectively. Each group encompassed around a third of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The work] demonstrates that we can in some way predict total final weight loss from the speed of weight loss observed in the first months of treatment,” said Prof Luca Busetto, of the University of Padova in Italy, one of the scientists behind the first analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers said most of the participants maintained clinically meaningful weight reduction over the course of the study. This was supported by a second analysis that found that average time to the lowest weight reached was 22 months, at which point participants had lost 23.1% of their starting weight on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While some subsequently regained weight – despite continuing with the medication – participants had nonetheless lost 19.4% of their starting weight, on average, by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team added that 70% of participants regained less than 5% of their starting weight after hitting their lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the trial, said the finding of different weight loss trajectories could help give an indication of how much weight an individual might expect to lose in the long term. “That might be able to guide the need for some individuals to consider newer therapies, which are more potent, in the future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Simon Cork, of Anglia Ruskin University, said the other analysis demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of tirzepatide in maintaining weight loss, which would be of interest to health bodies “as the costs of treating obesity-related co-morbidities rise year on year”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cork also noted long-term effectiveness and safety studies for such drugs were now at odds with guidance, which limits their use to a maximum of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings come as the Advertising Standards Authority announced that along with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the General Pharmaceutical Council, it had warned businesses that advertising prescription-only medications to the public was prohibited. This includes weight loss jabs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy and Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among other examples, the rules cover paid-for ads on social media “such as image or video ads on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok”, sponsored searches on Google or other search engines, and ads by influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Guardian investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/26/experts-concern-promotions-weight-loss-jabs-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that weight-loss injections were being aggressively marketed to British consumers through often illegal promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQcnVZMHgtOWd1Q19wdkNhYURVendnM3p4X09oakF4dXQwaU1sUlBMSUFweUprUF96Ymx2eXdIVEZBUUlGRkRHbktXZW5FM2dEUDBvSTVPeWtOb0dmQXhvdWVtMGNsNHhRQWNCMENXZjZNcDFzcmFqSlFSM0ZrazJDZ2JzNzB1TWt4Y0x4SDVSUFZWMm1TRUY4eE50TUw1cFdfWEY3d3ZteDR6WHhlZ3ZZdm9yQzVyYWV3RDFoNkFadS0</guid></item><item><title>This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0yNU9yRm83X3oxdlZTVF9uV09qT0hZM2VXLXdka04xMGxwVThneEVzdlhBU0F1SGZOeDhSR3EtZVpsWDNsVGN0R3oxY2ZLc3RBZjROYTMzcFEzZm5JNHpaWms2X0s4Yzc1VUF5Y2tqamxXQnRSUkZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderate iron consumption may help lower your risk of colorectal cancers like colon cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the three most diagnosed cancers in men and women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more plant-based iron may lower colon cancer risk by 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It ranks as the third most diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women, with nearly 2 million new cases reported in 2020.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically in Korea, colorectal cancer rates have been rising quickly, increasing by about 2.6% each year since 2019.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it is true that there are some factors that are out of our control when it comes to colon cancer risk, other factors, including smoking, drinking excess alcohol, lack of exercise and dietary choices, can be controlled. Recently, scientists have suggested that eating red and processed meats (like bacon) might increase the risk of colon cancer. One possible reason for that connection is the heme iron these foods contain. Heme iron is a type of iron found in animal-based foods, which is more easily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron found in plant-based sources. While there are benefits to leaning on heme iron, some researchers suggest they may contribute to harmful reactions in the body that increase cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, research on the link between heme iron and colon cancer has shown mixed results, with some studies suggesting a higher risk in Western countries and others showing little to no risk, especially in Asian countries like Japan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These findings highlight that the relationship may vary based on factors like gender, location and eating habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore how different types of iron in the diet, such as iron from animal sources (heme iron) and plant sources (non-heme iron), are linked to the risk of colorectal cancer in a large group of healthy Koreans, researchers conducted a study evaluating this population, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate the associations between total, heme, and non-heme iron intake and the risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in Koreans, researchers used data from The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study’s Health Examinees cohort (KoGES HEXA), a long-term research project carried out in health centers and hospitals across Korea. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the beginning of the study, researchers assessed what the participants typically ate over the past year using detailed interviews and a food questionnaire. This questionnaire asked how often participants ate certain foods and how much they usually ate. The questionnaire included 106 common foods in the Korean diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then calculated the iron content of these foods, measuring two types of dietary iron for each participant: heme iron, which comes from animal-based foods like meat and fish, and non-heme iron, found in plant-based foods and other sources. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cases of colorectal cancer in this study were identified using data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry, managed by the National Cancer Center of Korea. Additional data were collected about participants’ age, sex, smoking and drinking habits, education level, family history of colorectal cancer and any history of conditions like hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol. Information on physical activity was also gathered through questionnaires, while height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of this information, analyses were conducted to determine potential links. In total, 109,908 people (37,697 men and 71,401 women) were tracked for an average of 9.1 years, and their information was used for this analysis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the study, 608 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed (299 in men and 309 in women). Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;people who consumed moderate amounts of iron daily&lt;/strong&gt; had a noticeably lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who consumed the least amount of iron. For colon cancer specifically, moderate iron consumption also correlated to a lower risk. In this study, a moderate amount of iron was classified as 5.00–6.27 mg per day—that's about as much as you'd get in a serving of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279978/one-pot-lentils-rice-with-spinach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One-Pot Lentils &amp;amp; Rice with Spinach&lt;/a&gt;. (That's just a fraction of your recommended daily value, which varies depending on age and sex.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to heme iron consumption, the researchers didn’t see a noticeable effect on the risk of developing colorectal or colon cancer. But for non-heme iron consumption, the researchers found that people in the group with moderate non-heme iron intake had a lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those with the lowest consumption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, for those who consumed a moderate amount of non-heme iron: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;their risk of CRC was reduced by 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their risk of colon cancer was reduced by 30%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the men in the moderate non-heme group, the effects were even more significant. Men who consumed a moderate amount of non-heme iron had a 32% lower risk of CRC and a 44% lower risk of colon cancer. Additionally, as non-heme iron intake increased, there was a noticeable trend of lower colon cancer risk for both sexes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s interesting to note that the benefits of iron, particularly non-heme iron (plant-based iron), don’t increase steadily with higher consumption. Instead, the most protective effects were seen in a moderate intake range in this study. The researchers propose that this might be because iron consumption in Korea is generally quite low. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To put things into perspective, the recommended daily amount of iron is 8 mg for adult men and women over 51, and 18 mg for adult women under 50.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But for the lowest consumption group in this study, some participants were only getting between 1 and 5 mg of iron per day, which is far below the recommended amount.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors highlight that having too little iron has been linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, and this may be why strong benefits were not seen among those with the lowest intake of this nutrient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one has some limitations to be aware of. This study is observational, and observational studies often face challenges with confounding variables, like overall diet. Another limitation is that the researchers only measured dietary habits at the start of the study, so any changes in eating patterns over time weren’t taken into account. The study also neglected to collect information about any iron supplements that participants may have been taking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hearing headlines linking eating red meat to cancer can be alarming. But this study underscores how understanding the nuanced results of studies can help make informed dietary choices without overhauling your eating habits entirely. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, while these findings don’t conclusively link heme iron intake to colon cancer risk, it’s worth being mindful of your overall diet. Many Americans consume more meat than the recommended amounts, which could lead to overconsumption of heme iron along with other factors like saturated fats and calories that may contribute to health concerns.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t mean you need to cut out meat altogether—instead, focus on portion control and balancing your meals with plenty of plant-based foods, which are rich in other nutrients (like fiber—a nutrient that may be linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whenever you think about making a change to your eating habits, it’s crucial to consider your whole diet rather than just one nutrient. This study highlights that moderate, diversified consumption of both heme and non-heme iron might offer protective benefits, particularly in populations where overall iron intake tends to be lower. Incorporating iron-rich plant-based foods like lentils, spinach and tofu can support a well-rounded diet while offering additional advantages, such as dietary fiber and phytonutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t overdo it with this mineral—too much may not be a good thing for your body. But by taking small, practical steps, you can build a diet that’s both enjoyable and supportive of your health goals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the nuanced relationship between iron intake and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, particularly in a Korean population. The findings underscore the importance of balance, as moderate iron consumption, both heme and non-heme, was associated with a reduced risk of CRC and colon cancer. This research emphasizes that dietary habits, cultural context, and baseline nutrient consumption levels play a vital role in interpreting study results and shaping dietary recommendations. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study highlights potential protective effects of moderate iron intake, it also reminds us of the dangers of both under- and over-consumption. These findings reinforce the value of a well-rounded diet that includes a mix of nutrient-dense foods, emphasizing plant-based sources of iron alongside moderate portions of animal-based options.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials reported Friday the number of measles cases in Oklahoma has risen to 12.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine of the cases are confirmed and three are probable cases, which means patients show symptoms consistent with the national standard definition but lack a test result or a link to a laboratory-confirmed case.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma State Department of Health’s measles update also included two new risk-of-exposure notices in Oklahoma City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first location is Northwest Pediatrics of Oklahoma City, an outpatient clinic in the Mercy Plaza Building, 4140 W Memorial Rd. The exposure risk occurred 10:45 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 4. The OSDH worked with the clinic to identify individuals with a known exposure risk and will notify these individuals directly of their exposure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second location is the Aldi grocery store at 6965 Northwest Expressway. If you visited the location between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. April 6 and are unvaccinated, unsure of vaccine or immune status, or have concerns, health officials encourage you to provide your name and contact information on &lt;a href="https://redcap.health.ok.gov/surveys/?s=7N3ANHYJTT"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;, and someone from the health department will contact you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are possibly exposed and not immune through vaccination or prior infection should exclude themselves from public settings for 21 days from the date of their potential exposure, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last previous risk-of-exposure notice was for people who were at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health’s main entrance atrium, atrium elevators to the lower level and emergency department between 6:15 and 10 p.m. March 23.

                                &lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife has issued a warning related to a virus that's been popping up among the state's raccoons, with that virus resulting in a highly contagious and fatal disease that can be passed to dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Colorado Parks and Wildlife, multiple raccoons in the San Luis Valley area have tested positive for canine distemper in recent weeks. Canine distemper is a disease that's spread via a virus, most commonly passed along through direct contact with an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of canine distemper can vary and may not be obvious, though it typically results in animals having difficulty moving and can result in abnormal behavior due to a brain infection. Other symptoms include crusting around the eyes and nose, coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, and thickening of the paw pads. Once an animal contracts the disease, it usually does not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another particularly odd symptom associated with raccoons and distemper is that it can result in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildlifephotography/comments/vdktna/wild_raccoon_showing_signs_of_distemper/" target="_blank"&gt;glowing green eyes&lt;/a&gt; – no joke (read more about symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.delawarehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Distemper-.FAQ_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raccoons that tested positive for canine distemper were found in Alamosa and Monte Vista, though it's worth noting that other recent reports have indicated that the disease has been found among raccoon populations elsewhere in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife stressed the importance of getting pets vaccinated and to avoid allowing animals to interact with wildlife. It was also suggested that people work to keep wildlife from frequenting their backyards and to avoid leaving out water and food that could become contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just dogs and raccoons that can be impacted either. While the disease doesn't pass to humans, Colorado species including coyotes, foxes, skunks, and other wild carnivores can contract it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose of the MMR vaccine if traveling internationally. They will still need two additional doses later. In Washington State, all children under age 19 can get vaccines for free," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from about 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can happen even in healthy people, but those at highest risk include: infants and children under 5 years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems from medications or underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection against measles.

			&lt;p&gt;Old age awaits everyone, but it hits some harder – and earlier – than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way we age hinges partly on factors beyond our control, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-discovered-a-subtle-genetic-imbalance-that-may-drive-aging"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-is-far-more-dangerous-than-all-the-violence-in-the-world-study-shows"&gt;exposure to pollutants&lt;/a&gt;. But research suggests we can still influence the outcome with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;key behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, especially in how we sleep, exercise, and eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new 30-year study, researchers have taken an in-depth look at the links between eating habits and healthy aging, which they define as reaching age 70 without major chronic diseases or declines in cognitive, physical, or mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is among the first to analyze multiple dietary patterns in middle age in relation to overall healthy aging, explains co-author Frank Hu, epidemiologist at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies have previously investigated dietary patterns in the context of specific diseases or how long people live," Hu &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "Ours takes a multifaceted view, asking, 'How does diet impact people's ability to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life as they age?'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hu and his colleagues used longitudinal data from 105,000 adults between the ages of 39 and 69 (averaging 53 years old), collected between 1986 and 2016 as part of the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects regularly completed dietary questionnaires over the 30-year period. The authors of the new study scored their eating habits by adherence to eight dietary patterns, seeking to learn which is most likely to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight dietary patterns are: the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt; (AHEI), the Alternative Mediterranean Index (aMED), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH_diet"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt;), the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-diet-created-by-scientists-has-been-linked-to-better-cognitive-performance-in-the-elderly"&gt;MIND&lt;/a&gt;), the healthful plant-based diet (hPDI), the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI), the empirically inflammatory dietary pattern (EDIP), and the empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eight dietary patterns share some basic inclinations, the researchers note, such as a focus on whole, plant-based foods and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to those eight patterns, the study examined subjects' consumption of ultra-processed foods – industrial creations often featuring many ingredients and excessive sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found 9,771 participants met their definition of healthy aging, representing 9.3 percent of the sample population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eight dietary patterns were associated with healthy aging, the study found, so adhering to any one of them raised a person's odds of staying spry at 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This suggests the solution isn't simple, the researchers note, and no single diet is best for everyone. That said, one contender did stand out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best diet overall for healthy aging is the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;AHEI&lt;/a&gt;, according to the findings. It's similar to the older Healthy Eating Index, the researchers explain, but more oriented toward preventing chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects in the top quintile for the AHEI were 86 percent more likely to achieve healthy aging at 70 than those in the lowest quintile, the study found. If the cutoff age was 75, the top quintile was 2.24 times likelier to age healthily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AHEI emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, while minimizing red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened drinks, sodium, and refined grains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since staying active and independent is a priority for both individuals and public health, research on healthy aging is essential," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Marta Guasch-Ferré, Harvard nutritionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may promote overall healthy aging and help shape future dietary guidelines," she &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the AHEI showed the best results, it was closely followed by several others, including the aMED, DASH, PHDI, and MIND, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the strongest link to overall healthy aging, the AHEI had the strongest link with maintaining physical function and mental health. The PHDI showed the strongest link with maintaining cognitive health and surviving to age 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/added-sugar-in-your-diet-may-speed-up-your-bodys-biological-aging"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, was associated with a lower likelihood of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also show that there is no one-size-fits-all diet. Healthy diets can be adapted to fit individual needs and preferences," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author Anne-Julie Tessier, nutritionist at the University of Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the infectious dose of &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; O1 has been estimated to be 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;8 &lt;/sup&gt;[100,000 to 100 million] colony-forming units (CFU), this suggests the holy water was heavily contaminated and bacteria remained viable at ambient temperature during the flight and in Europe," the German and UK researchers who authored the report wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global plague&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing indicated that the cholera strain that the travelers brought home was a particularly nasty one. &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; O1, which is linked to other recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa, is resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, namely: fluroquinolones, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, macrolides, and sulphonamides. The strain also carried a separate genetic element (a plasmid) that provided resistance mechanisms against streptomycin and spectinomycin, cephalosporins, macrolides, and sulphonamides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main treatment for cholera, which causes profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, is oral rehydration. Antibiotics are sometimes used to reduce severity. Fortunately, this strain was still susceptible to the antibiotic tetracycline, one of the drugs of choice for cholera. However, there are reports of other cholera strains in Africa that have also acquired tetracycline resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, "The extension of a cholera outbreak in Africa causing a cluster of infections in Europe is unusual," the authors write. They call for travelers to be aware of infectious threats when eating and drinking abroad—and to not ingest holy water. Clinicians should also be aware of the potential of cholera in travelers to Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly fight cholera outbreaks, though, there needs to be sustained investment in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Cases of cholera have surged globally after the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-09-2024-data-show-marked-increase-in-annual-cholera-deaths"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Low-income countries will continue to need overseas development aid support to control outbreaks and epidemics using effective WASH, surveillance, communications, diagnostics and countermeasure programmatic delivery," the authors of the Eurosurveillance report write.&lt;/p&gt;

Packed with fibre, vitamins, and minerals, its nutrient-dense profile and whole-grain goodness make it a perfect choice for wellness enthusiasts. But this seemingly wholesome food carries a hidden risk that many don't talk about. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.70008" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in published in the journal Risk Analysis warns that brown rice has a toxic metal that could have serious consequences for brain health, especially in young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Michigan State University have discovered that brown rice has 15 percent higher levels of arsenic, a toxic metal associated with cancer and brain damage. This wouldn't affect a healthy adult so much, but it could be troublesome for brain development in young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which age group is at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hidden arsenic in brown rice could be detrimental for children between the ages of six to 24 months. Children eating them had twice the estimated arsenic exposure compared to those consuming white rice in similar quantities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when young children are exposed to arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young children are exposed to arsenic, it can interfere with their brain development. This exposure is linked to lower IQ, learning difficulties, and behavioral issues. Studies have associated it with higher risks of autism and ADHD. Even low levels, over time, can have lasting effects on cognitive and neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4026128/#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20studies%20have,the%20most%20affected%20cognitive%20skill." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have shown that arsenic can lead to cognitive deficits in children, even at low concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of time, the long-term exposure to arsenic can increase cancer risk. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds as “carcinogenic to humans.” These chemicals can cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, and skin cancer. Some studies also link it to kidney cancer, liver cancer and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research is important because it acknowledges the importance of considering food safety along with nutrition when consumers make choices about food. While we found that choosing brown rice over white rice would result in higher arsenic exposure on average, the levels should not cause long-term health problems unless someone ate an enormous amount of brown rice every day for years," said Felicia Wu, a professor at the university and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why brown rice has more arsenic than white rice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because unlike white rice, in case of brown rice, the outer brown layer of the grain called rice bran is not removed. This is where the arsenic is accumulated in higher concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice brain is removed in case of white rice, which reduces arsenic concentration, thus lessening risk of complications due to arsenic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers compared arsenic exposure from brown and white rice, they found that 48 percent of the arsenic in brown rice was in the more toxic inorganic form, compared to 33 percent in white rice, posing a greater potential health risk. Arsenic exists in two main forms: inorganic and organic, and the difference between them lies in both their chemical composition and toxicity. Inorganic arsenic is the more harmful of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown rice grown in the rest of the world had a 65 percent inorganic concentration level while white rice also had a 53 percent concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outer layer of the rice that makes it brown contains arsenic concentrations 10 times higher than the rice endosperm, which is the white interior portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also found that infants and toddlers between the ages of six to 24 months who consumed brown rice might ingest arsenic at levels of 0.29 to 0.59 micrograms per kilogram of body weight every day far higher than the recommended safe limit of 0.21 micrograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rice bran and brown rice are shown to have a higher arsenic content and inorganic arsenic concentration than the grain endosperm or white rice," the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study finds low glycemic index diet helps heart patients lose weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 18:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Cancer dietitian reveals controversial snack that wards off cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQR0JxeDBLNk92aVJzX1ZZVVBXSWZacU9fY3Z2RlBtRm0xTVlTRFZsNGJqN1o0TzN4RjJaOEZJeW00X2VwelduNENGY0NEczNGMUhlODNYcmZqZFR5bmd0QjZ6bnZTZlBwZV80cUtDdXVwSnFMZ0E2VTJicm5ldEdyR3RlenRNLTBVMld3NXBNeTlDeFBqOFdzTNIBngFBVV95cUxQN3RyWmEzLTI5UnJLY1RuQmVoOW9nOHI4Mml1d1JySUNmVXY0bkMxTHBybFJvb1RtV3NQeW00SlFNLTNGdHc3LXp3Zi1QT2pId2xRQUZ2WGtFMUtncnpQcG8wMjZWeU5BNmhVSzlLTEZIWHo0MlpIeWlFcDR3Q3g4b1VfcUFuVzEtMmRmelpVTWg0ckhHYUZJQUd2ZThkQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-35b84930-16ef-11f0-b629-21169ba05b5e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; dietician claims that a simple, budget-friendly snack can help protect against the disease — but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14547143/Jenny-McCarthy-dying-vegan-diet-carnivore.html"&gt;meat lovers might be left wanting. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nichole Andrews, 38, a registered dietician and nutritionist specializing in oncology for the past 15 years, says that a combination of carrots, peppers, peas, olives and string cheese can stave off your chances of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14596467/weight-loss-mom-stage-3-colon-cancer-age-38.html"&gt;developing cancer. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Photos of the lackluster combo in a small bowl aren't the most appetizing, but the expert told her 200,000 &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-bf81d7e0-16fd-11f0-a653-e3c58c7a709d"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers: 'It's going to keep you full, it's going to keep you satisfied, and you're going to feel refreshed and good after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is my favorite snack, I have it multiple times a week in the afternoon. And the best part: it's going to help you reduce cancer risk.'    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Costing less than $3 per serving, she claims that the healthy fats from the cheese, antioxidants in the olives and the fiber from the vegetables can do wonders for the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Every bite of fruit and vegetable – fresh, frozen, or canned – reduces your risk of cancer and recurrence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The short clip shows Andrews preparing some carrots, peppers and snap peas by washing them under water, chopping them and adding it to a bowl with Kalamata olives and a piece of string cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that it is not necessary for the vegetables to be organic for them to be beneficial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A  combination of carrots, peppers, peas, olives and string cheese can stave off your chances of developing cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, magnesium, potassium, and other minerals found in peas can lower your risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green peas also contain saponins, plant compounds known for having anti-cancer effects by preventing tumor growth and inducing cell death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, olives are filled with antioxidants such as like oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol that can neutralize and destroy cancerous cells in the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combined with vegetables, the savory fruit can help prevent DNA damage and maintain the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite common notion, cheese is a healthy source of calcium, fat, Vitamins A and B12, along with zinc and phosphorus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The American Cancer Society at least 40 percent of all cancer cases and nearly 50 percent of cancer deaths in adults aged 30 years or older in the US are preventable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say that the calcium in cheese can help improve bone health, protein to build and maintain muscle tissue and some forms of aged cheeses also contain probiotics, which can benefit gut bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Andrews says that food is a key way to keep the disease at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know how amazing and powerful nutrition can be to help survivors have better treatment outcomes and reduce risk of recurrence,' Nichole, who is based in Tri-Cities, Washington, US, previously told Need To Know of her work in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sadly there is so much misinformation out there, that people cannot eat well – so I am so happy to clear up that confusion and help people eat with confidence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society at least 40 percent of all cancer cases and nearly 50 percent of cancer deaths in adults aged 30 years or older in the US are preventable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The average patient age was 7.8 years, and 51.4% were male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56284-0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to controls, children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at significantly greater risk for high blood pressure (1.5% vs 1.1% in controls), abnormal ventricular rhythms (0.9% vs 0.7%), myocarditis (0.1% vs 0.02%), heart failure (1.6% vs 1.2%), cardiomyopathy (0.6% vs 0.4%), cardiac arrest (0.5% vs 0.4%), thromboembolism (0.9% vs 0.7%), chest pain (1.2% vs 0.6%), and palpitations (0.4% vs 0.3%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to timely referrals, diagnostic evaluations, and management to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were similar in patients with and without CHDs, but those with CHDs had a higher risk of atrial fibrillation.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Risks were consistent regardless of age, sex, race, obesity status, COVID-19 severity, and SARS-CoV-2 variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the CHD group had higher absolute risks of any post-COVID cardiovascular outcome than those without CHDs (5.6% for infected patients vs 4.0% for controls with CHD; 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively, in those without CHD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even children and adolescents without a history of any cardiovascular outcomes before SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks, suggesting a broad potential impact on those previously considered at low risk of cardiovascular disease," the study authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Awareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to timely referrals, diagnostic evaluations, and management to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications in children and adolescents," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No difference on cardiac testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-025-10774-0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; followed up with 1,080 adult participants from a COVID-19 registry in Poland after infection with a pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant or Omicron up to January 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A follow-up visit at 3 to 6 months post-infection consisted of symptom monitoring and testing with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), Holter electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. A total of 504 patients also took the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) test and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) starting in June 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The average patient age was 56.9 years, 68.9% were women, 75.2% were vaccinated against COVID-19, 53.1% were infected during Omicron predominance, 44.4% had high blood pressure (hypertension), and 18.0% had abnormal cholesterol levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least one of the analyzed symptoms was noted in 586 patients (54.3%, including patients with any COVID-19 severity), indicating cardiac long COVID; those without cardiac symptoms served as controls. The most common symptom was fatigue (38.9%). Palpitations occurred in 17.6% of patients, and 1.8% reported fainting episodes. Nearly half of patients had only one cardiac symptom (45.7%), while 0.6% had all investigated symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with palpitations had stronger premature ventricular contractions than those without palpitations, but they also had lower average systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The comparative analysis of adults with and without cardiac long COVID showed no differences on ABPM, Holter ECG, or echocardiography. The lack of difference may be due to the asymptomatic nature of some cardiac complications and a too-short follow-up to allow cardiac damage to be reflected on standard cardiovascular tests, the researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Link between mental illness, cardio symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with cardiac symptoms had higher scores on the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 and higher percentages of responses indicating increased risk of anxiety or depression. In this group, 290 (57.4%) reported one or more analyzed symptoms. Patients with PHQ-2 scores of at least 3 had higher heart rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with or without comorbidities should still undergo regular cardiological checks to detect potential later complications, such as long-term cardiovascular symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Potential mechanisms linking mental illness to cardiovascular symptoms in long-COVID patients may include chronic inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction, the authors said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Prolonged stress and anxiety can lead to elevated cortisol levels, which may exacerbate hypertension and arrhythmias," they wrote. "Additionally, shared pathways such as oxidative stress and immune dysregulation could further explain the interplay between these conditions, which is critical for developing holistic and integrated treatment strategies."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Risk factors for cardiac long COVID were female sex, asthma, and COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Patients with or without comorbidities should still undergo regular cardiological checks to detect potential later complications, such as long-term cardiovascular symptoms," the authors advised. "Clinical practice should also include broad patient education, informing them about potential cardiovascular symptoms after COVID-19 infection, regardless of the dominant variant, and emphasizing the importance of early reporting of any concerning symptoms." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Justin Stebbing, Professor of Biomedical Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Justin Stebbing, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;writing on The Conversation website&lt;/a&gt; explained that a recent study had found that it could have a protective impact against cancers developing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have admitted that the big increase in colorectal cancer cases among people under 55 is causing concern - it has doubled globally in the last few years. It is thought that diet is a big factor in this - especially the rise of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Stebbing said: “As a consultant oncologist, many people have asked me how their risk can be reduced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The emerging evidence suggests that regular yoghurt consumption may have a protective effect against certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer by modifying the gut microbiome, the natural bacteria that live in the gut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in overall health, influencing digestion, immune function and even cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The gut bacteria can live inside cancer itself, and in general a healthy balance of these bacteria is thought to be essential for maintaining a strong immune system and preventing inflammation, which can contribute to cancer development.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason Prof Stebbing thinks yoghurt can help is because it contains live cultures of beneficial bacteria, such as lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, which can help maintain this balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: “The study found that consuming two or more servings of yoghurt per week was associated with a lower risk of a specific type of aggressive colorectal cancer, which occurs on the right side of the colon and is associated with poorer survival outcomes compared with cancers on the left side.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Research analysed 150,000 people&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study analysed data from over 150,000 participants followed for several decades, indicating that long-term yoghurt consumption may alter the gut microbiome in ways that protect against certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed the participants every two years about their yoghurt intake, and measured the amount of Bifidobacterium (a type of bacteria found in yoghurt) in the tumour tissue of 3,079 people within the sample who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While yoghurt did not directly lower the risk for all types of colorectal cancer, those who ate two or more servings of yoghurt per week had a lower risk of developing “Bifidobacterium-positive proximal colon cancer”, a type of colorectal cancer that occurs in the right side of the colon and has one of the lowest survival rates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nutritional scientist Prof Tim Spector, founder of the Zoe app, said he eats yoghurt “most days of the week” as it is ideal for a healthy gut microbiome - something that can aid digestion and keep your immune system strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tim said: “For yoghurts I never go for fat-free products. I don’t like the taste of them and they’re not good for my sugar spikes either.” In the video caption he added: “By choosing fat containing yoghurts I feel fuller for longer and I also prefer the taste.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoghurt has calcium meanign it’s good for bones and staving off osteoporosis. Regular yoghurt consumption has also been associated with lower blood pressure and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Some studies suggest that yoghurt intake may help prevent type 2 diabetes and other diseases too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cases of bowel cancer&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are nearly 45,000 cases of bowel cancer every year in the UK, making it the nation’s fourth most common cancer, and third worldwide – but many of these are preventable. According to Cancer Research UK data, 54% of all bowel cancers could be prevented by having a healthier lifestyle. Smoking, lack of exercise, alcohol, eating processed meat, and poor diet are all significant factors in the development of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPTV90NElKbzVOWlZ0UzRaMW1UajlVU3NNcjJXTTVzTXBCWk95YzkwWlN0NmNRMzVZSTBDOXBzZ3ZhRUFaQXlTSXBrWmwzcXBVT25vc0tydmM2TkVnQmNXeUhLN3UxMk12VnVDQ3A1elFQbHFyc1h0RjRwNjlEYjR6allxcHFicnBJNF9n0gGQAUFVX3lxTFBIdkJqenJ2M0RjakR0dEVHeFRlV2lsaXFBaE5zNFlBYnVDWnNHNTBZSEtiNWVzVU14REI4azJjQWFYUmhpRktfdVpwbVVDSnVpdGdUTkJzNF9qNEc3dHA2ZEdldVhZZFVpWDRLMW1PdXpDOUxyUHFIYmNfSlZ0Yi16Ulh1bnVNNEJTMDhFSVNJSg</guid></item><item><title>Oncology expert says eat this for breakfast every day to stop killer bowel cancer - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPTV90NElKbzVOWlZ0UzRaMW1UajlVU3NNcjJXTTVzTXBCWk95YzkwWlN0NmNRMzVZSTBDOXBzZ3ZhRUFaQXlTSXBrWmwzcXBVT25vc0tydmM2TkVnQmNXeUhLN3UxMk12VnVDQ3A1elFQbHFyc1h0RjRwNjlEYjR6allxcHFicnBJNF9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist has spoken about how the risk of lethal bowel cancer can be drastically reduced by having one thing for breakfast each day.

    &lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in a single week has topped 90 for the first time since a record wave &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-one cases of measles were reported with rashes that began the week of March 23, with Arkansas, Hawaii and Indiana joining the list of two dozen states with confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week of March 30, 81 cases were reported, and another 21 cases were reported for the following week. But those figures are expected to rise as more cases are confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. — the second-highest number of cases reported in a single year since the 1990s. Nearly 30,000 measles cases were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001999.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported in 1990&lt;/a&gt;, largely due to gaps in vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-texas-measles-outbreak-layoffs-rfk-vaccines/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that," Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy compared the nation's measles figures to those in Europe, which &lt;a href="https://measles-rubella-monthly.ecdc.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;has seen&lt;/a&gt; thousands more measles cases and several more deaths. Health officials there have been grappling with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;record measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in recent years due to steep gaps in vaccination rates in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Europe, prolonged local outbreaks of measles had been declared eliminated in the Americas. Officials &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-americas-risk-losing-elimination-status/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;have warned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that this year's outbreaks in the region are now threatening that public health achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, "We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccine-cdc-texas-kansas-travel/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;letter to health departments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current increase in measles cases in the United States is due to people returning to the United States from international trips with measles and an expanding outbreak among communities with low vaccination coverage in Texas and other states," the CDC wrote in its letter.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s not the only type of allergy threat getting worse with warming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other allergens, like &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92178-z"&gt;mold spores&lt;/a&gt;, whose spread coincides with higher temperatures and weather disruption. But one of the most insidious and underrated dangers is now coming from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39755273/"&gt;stinging and biting insects&lt;/a&gt;. These wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and bees are showing up in new areas and in greater numbers as more places become suitable for their hives, nests, and colonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Insect allergies are much less common than pollen sensitivity across the population, but they can cause severe, deadly complications, and they are far less studied. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7227a6.htm"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, on average, 72 people in the United States died from insect allergies per year over the past decade. But insect allergies send &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/insect-sting-allergies/"&gt;thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; to the emergency room every year, and millions of people live with the fear that the next insect that lands on them could ruin their day. “From a public health point of view, it’s been heavily underserved,” said &lt;a href="https://annualmeeting.acaai.org/2024/conference_schedule.cfm?speakerCRMKey=5DD7EC8A-31F2-4849-8595-60032B1C2520&amp;amp;shared=true"&gt;David Golden&lt;/a&gt;, an allergy researcher and part-time faculty at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result is that many people are experiencing allergic reactions from insects for the first time, sometimes unsure of where they’re coming from. Many doctors are also unaware of how to diagnose and treat insect allergies. And as the climate changes, the allergy threat from arthropods is likely to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-insect-allergies-are-on-the-rise" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why insect allergies are on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Changes in the climate are making the world more welcoming for insects that bite and sting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Warmer winters and earlier springs mean more critters like yellow jackets and hornets survive the cooler seasons and emerge early in the year in greater numbers. And as temperatures continue to rise, previously inhospitable parts of the country are becoming habitable for insects, allowing species like fire ants to migrate further north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-navigate-our-buggier-world" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to navigate our buggier world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Allergies from stinging insects are getting worse as the climate changes, but there are some things you can do to keep your symptoms manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Reduce skin exposure with shoes, socks, and long sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Inspect the grass, shrubs, and nooks around your home for nests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Most insect repellent products don’t work on the most worrisome stinging insects, so it’s best to avoid the places where they live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Some pain, redness, and itchiness after a bite or sting is normal, but you should &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/insect-allergy/"&gt;get medical help&lt;/a&gt; if you experience larger rashes, dizziness, trouble breathing, swelling around the mouth, or stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Talk to an allergy specialist if you suspect you have an insect allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• If you are allergic, develop a treatment plan and an emergency plan with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s bad news for the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/insect-allergy"&gt;3 percent of adults and 1 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; who have insect allergies. Stinging insect venom in particular is notorious for causing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anaphylaxis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351468"&gt;anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a life-threatening allergic reaction where blood pressure plummets and airways swell, making it difficult to breathe. And most people don’t know that they’re allergic until they’ve been bitten or stung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Golden explained that there are three broad categories of insects that concern allergy specialists: bees, wasps, and ants. People who have insect allergies are not necessarily allergic to all of them, and even within these groups, someone can react to one variety but not another. There are treatments such as immunotherapy that can protect an allergy sufferer from insect sting complications, but they often provide relief from the bite of just a specific kind of insect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That was evident in Europe in recent years with the arrival of the invasive &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-46029832"&gt;Asian hornet&lt;/a&gt;. “They were reporting that even people who were known to be allergic to yellow jackets and hornets were getting the allergy shots — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8734599/"&gt;venom immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; — to protect them and they were stung by yellow jackets and hornets and they were fine,” Golden said. “But when they got stung by this Asian hornet, they had anaphylaxis all over again. It’s another allergy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/fire-ant-allergy"&gt;fire ants&lt;/a&gt; are also a major concern for allergy sufferers. This is an aggressive, hardy invasive species that took root in the warm climate of the southern and southeastern US, but is gradually moving northward. Their range now reaches &lt;a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/climate_change/how-climate-change-is-fueling-virginia-s-fire-ant-invasion/article_21bb5462-6abb-11ea-8abf-1b6d11e8354b.html"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, and they sporadically pop up in &lt;a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/wildlife/insects/html/invasive.html"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Strictly speaking, ticks are not insects, but they are also moving further north as the climate warms. The spread of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/climate-change-fueling-increase-of-lone-star-tick-sightings-in-minnesota/"&gt;lone star tick&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning because it can trigger a dangerous allergy condition known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/about/index.html"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. When the tick bites a host, it transmits a sugar that makes victims &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;react to red meat&lt;/a&gt; like beef, pork, and lamb, as well as products made from mammals. Climate change is also helping spread the ticks that carry &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1307799"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="alaska-is-a-window-into-the-future-of-seasonal-allergies" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Alaska is a window into the future of seasonal allergies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of these factors are converging in America’s largest state, which is warming up to &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/alaska-and-changing-climate"&gt;three times faster than the global average&lt;/a&gt;. And since the climate there is starting from such a cold baseline, many residents are encountering allergy triggers for the first time the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We did a study that showed the further north you went, the higher the prevalence of people seeking health care, urgent care for stinging events,” said Jeffrey Demain, an allergist in Anchorage, Alaska, and clinical professor at the University of Washington. “With milder winters, you have more survival of the hibernaculum, so the queens, they come out in the spring, and they’re already impregnated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Alaska is also getting walloped hard by pollen and mold. “Birch pollen levels can become incredibly high here,” Demain said. “In fact, we oftentimes are the highest in the world. We kind of trade off between Finland, Sweden, and Alaska as far as who has the highest levels.” Sensitivity to pollen can also trigger reactions to certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts, a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/food/pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/"&gt;pollen food allergy syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/oral-allergy-syndrome-(oas)"&gt;oral allergy syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. And as warmer air moves in, there’s a growing shift from snow to rain, as well as an &lt;a href="https://www.uaf.edu/news/alaskas-changing-environment-new-report.php"&gt;increase in intense rain events&lt;/a&gt;. More rain means more humidity, which means more mold, which in turn causes major problems for buildings in Alaska built to insulate against the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other environmental threats mixed into all this as well. Alaska has seen an &lt;a href="https://www.frames.gov/afsc/ACWE"&gt;increase in large wildfires&lt;/a&gt; in recent years and is &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/climate-change-and-wildfire-alaska"&gt;projected to burn more&lt;/a&gt; as average temperatures rise. These fires send huge clouds of smoke and ash into Alaska’s cities, towns, and villages. “Even though that might not be in your immediate area, it causes a tremendous amount of pollution, and the particulates in the air can travel long, long distances,” Demain said. The degraded air quality can irritate airways and &lt;a href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/wildfire-smoke-and-your-health/"&gt;make people more susceptible to allergens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It shows that allergies don’t exist in a vacuum and that climate change can create health problems that intersect and exacerbate each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Looking at allergies alone doesn’t tell the whole story about the magnitude of the threat. It also shows that it’s essential to slow the underlying changes to the climate by reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in order to tamp down on the dangers of future allergies and related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPdkNVM001MlNVaHgxQXZiMWFlOXNFSkZGejJEVjUtWHlvdlY5MHNxUXlISGIyY1I0TmdmeEl3b3hkbUV3Nlh1anRaTVhmZU8zdkZ1VmhzX0NJbi1lSlR0LXExd1pLR0E4SHE0SVJXNER0NDBkX1pSdXFEdEs1NlBWSV9aMDhBdw</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak now totals over 600 cases in three states; El Paso County reports cases - Dallas News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOeXdXWFZIa1hmYWV0UHlMUVdpT2RUT3A4SE1vV3RHT0tMNl9BLTlrbnpVRmliXzA0X21RVlY3dktYUGtQbHVocDFFZWVKeHBxUHVsbE9aQTU1bVdac00xYkJhU3RHdFVELVVEdmwyWXlOOWh6c1ZKOWloYXBqVHdKMjFxdFRxelJHZUZPbFFNeFJhOUtDWXRoZnJmeHJkOG5SQjZRSlpJTFpMcGk5VmVlUzRBaUxERC1qa3NvMUIyQ1d6QmNWQUFMYXJ2Um1sU2QzcTBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Texas’ &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/04/08/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-to-more-than-500-cases/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/04/08/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-to-more-than-500-cases/"&gt;measles case count&lt;/a&gt; jumped again, new data showed on Friday, with an additional 36 cases reported in the prior three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The state &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;has now reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 541 measles cases in the ongoing outbreak that began in West Texas in January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The outbreak has spread to an additional county as well.

&lt;p&gt;The United States continues to have the highest &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/17/us-maternal-mortality-hits-highest-rates-since-1965-report/"&gt;maternal mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; among wealthy nations — and new research suggests the crisis is deepening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832320?guestAccessKey=601c54f6-1301-480b-a5cc-38ece562efb7&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=040925" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published this week in JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found that the rate of these “largely preventable” deaths rose by nearly 28% between 2018 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The concerning rates in the US should be an urgent public health priority,” wrote the study authors, who also identified a disturbing gap between states when it comes to maternal deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The rate of pregnancy-related deaths hit its peak during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;mikumistock – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An alarming rise in maternal deaths&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, using CDC data, focused on health issues during pregnancy and up to one year after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 18 million live births that took place over the four year study period, researchers identified 6,238 pregnancy-related deaths among women ages 15 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, nearly a third of those deaths happened more than six weeks after childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Late maternal death occurs in what could be a health care delivery gap between &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/new-york-employers-must-now-offer-paid-medical-leave-of-at-least-20-hours-for-prenatal-care-during-pregnancy/"&gt;obstetric care&lt;/a&gt; and transition to primary care,” the study authors noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crisis in the South &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Southeast, the news is especially bleak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These states had the highest rate of pregnancy-related deaths nationwide from 2018 to 2022, with Alabama topping the list at 59.7 deaths per 100,000 live births. Mississippi took second place. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Death rates varied more than threefold between states. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, California had the lowest rate in the US. at 18.5 deaths per 100,000, followed by Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, researchers said that if every state matched California’s number, more than 2,679 deaths could have been avoided over the four year stretch.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young moms hardest hit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that the rate of pregnancy-related deaths rose from 25.3 per 100,000 live births in 2018 to a peak of 44.1 in 2021, coinciding with the height of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/23/pregnant-women-share-what-its-like-to-be-expecting-during-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The rate then fell slightly to 32.6 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the increase in deaths occurred across all age groups, women aged 25 to 39 experienced the most significant rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease — the number one cause of pregnancy-related deaths overall — played a major role in the spike, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/rose-molina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Rose L. Molina&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study’s authors, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/health/maternal-death-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Common complications of pregnancy include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and infections. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AntonioDiaz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She explained that pregnancy puts extra stress on the heart and can worsen hidden or existing conditions like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/10/health/i-scary-preeclampsia-heres-what-other-moms-should-know/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/health/heart-disease-risk-higher-for-women-who-have-these-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; itself is becoming more common in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We seem as a society to be getting sicker earlier, which is why we’re seeing this in that particular age group,” said Molina, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other leading culprits that fueled the rising death toll include &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/30/pregnant-women-face-cancer-risk-from-chemicals-in-most-household-products/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/16/number-of-pregnant-women-with-depression-rises-sharply/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; issues, substance abuse and alcohol. The study did not include accidents, homicides or other deaths not medically linked to pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The racial and ethnic divide&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In addition to the state-by-state disparities, researchers also identified widening gaps in pregnancy-related deaths among different races and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Native American and Alaskan Native women faced the highest rates, followed by Black women.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study authors said this suggests that “these groups may face disparities in access to postnatal care, as well as other socioeconomic and systemic challenges impacting maternal health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, pregnancy-related deaths were lowest among White, Hispanic and Asian women.&lt;/p&gt;

Diet is one of the most common and modifiable (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jasper Senff, lead study author and post-doctoral fellow at the Singh Lab at the Brain Care Labs, said: 'Dementia, stroke, and late-life depression are connected and intertwined, so if you develop one of them, there's a substantial chance you may develop another one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And because they share these overlapping risk factors, preventive efforts could lead to a reduction in the incidence of more than one of these diseases, which provides an opportunity to simultaneously reduce the burden of age-related brain diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review was published earlier this month in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/21/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp;amp; Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers analyzed 37 articles. Of those, 36 were on stroke, 16 were on dementia, and two were on late-life depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then combined the data to identify modiable risk factors, or those that can be altered with behavioral changes, shared by at least two of the three diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 17 risk factors associated with at least two of the diseases were: blood pressure, kidney disease, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, alcohol use, diet, hearing loss, pain, physical activity, purpose in life, sleep, smoking, social engagement, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, the team found high blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the greatest impact on incidence and burden of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure damages blood vessels in the brain, limiting blood flow to areas like the brain. This causes brain cells to die, resulting in dementia, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also a leading cause of stroke due to this blood vessel damage, as blood vessels become more prone to blockages. Elevated blood pressure also weakens the inner lining of the arteries, causing plaque to build up and clots to form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, high blood pressure can cause inflammation in the brain, which is thought to increase the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney disease, on the other hand, prevents the body from filtering out harmful toxins, which can damage brain cells and arteries, leading to dementia, stroke and late-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidney disease, which is treated with dialysis (pictured here), raises the risk of dementia through toxins building up in the body and damaging blood vessels and brain cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cognitive activities like puzzles and card games had the lowest association with dementia, though experts noted this could be because people with dementia have a more difficult time completing cognitive tasks in general (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity and leisure time cognitive activity, such as completing puzzles, were associated with the lowest risk of brain disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers suggested these associations may be 'symptomatic rather than causal,' as people with brain disorders like dementia may be less capable of exercising or doing puzzles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure, diet and physical activity were the three risk factors shared by all three diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at more 'overlooked' factors like fulfillment in life, hearing quality, and pain sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emerging evidence suggests having a purpose in life can protect against changes in the brain that lead to dementia, such as brain cell death and a buildup of toxic proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high quality of life also reduces the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing loss has also been shown to cause cognitive strain and prevent social interactions, which add stress to the brain and can increase dementia and stroke risk.

surgeon Dr Karan Raj the 'reverse cowgirl position' — when the woman is on top and faces away from her partner — presents the biggest risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the penis doesn't contain any bones, the internal connective tissue which fills with blood during an erection can fracture when the appendage is subject to sharp, blunt force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such an event is usually accompanied by a distinct cracking, popping or snapping sound and afterwards resembles an 'aubergine' turning purple and swollen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-edb5d310-16c5-11f0-8159-25e6c44b51f6" class=""&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; clip shared with his 5.3million followers Dr Raj&lt;span&gt; said: 'If there is any erratic thrusting or if the movements of the two parties are not in sync, the male [penis] could slip out and be crushed by the female pubic bone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You have been warned over active sex can lead to your penis looking like an enlarged aubergine.'     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest NHS data shows 162 men had to have an operation to save their manhood in 2023-24 after suffering a 'fracture of the penis'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics have warned one sex position could be responsible for up to half of all penile fractures, an eye-watering injury that can leave men in agony&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of those being rushed to hospital was 44, though the oldest patients were in their late 70s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2015 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/768158"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/brazil/index.html" id="mol-c9fea290-16e7-11f0-9bbc-e71d829dfe81" class=""&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; found that sexual positions where women were on top resulted in half of all penile fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was followed by positions involving the woman on all-fours, which were responsible for 29 per cent of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the safest position in the bedroom was revealed as the man-on-top or 'missionary position'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The reverse cowgirl can pose dangers, in some cases, the penis can be injured if you're a little too enthusiastic with the thrusting,' sex and relationship expert Annabelle Knight told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/most-dangerous-sex-position-reverse-cowgirl-094836-20240227"&gt;LadBible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If this is the case there's a risk that the penis can fall out and then be sat on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But fear not, because as long as you and your partner keep an open dialogue, take your time, and embrace sensuality, then this position shouldn't give you too much trouble.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other studies have suggested that reverse cowgirl is not actually the most dangerous intimate arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.scielo.br/j/ibju/a/V9WQsVvbC6rnNF8CP8LfJtg/?lang=en"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;of nearly 500 men who suffered a penile fracture in East &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-c9fe2d60-16e7-11f0-9bbc-e71d829dfe81"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;

These are surrounded by a fibrous lining, known as tunica albuginea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fracture occurs when these areas rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of a penile fracture, in addition to the aforementioned popping or cracking sound, include, unsurprisingly, a great deal of pain and sudden loss of an erection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the circumstances of a penile fracture can be embarrassing this shouldn't delay victims seeking immediate medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because delays increases the risk of complications including erectile dysfunction, abnormal penis shape, medically called Peyronie's disease, and pain during future erections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery is normally required to fix penile fractures with a medic stitching the tunica albuginea back together and repairing any other affected tissues like the urethra, the tube urine passes through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxObHR0RlRkNUlEcHN6RTkyQURZd1NpeWRPcllldmdHbldKY0pObUFhY1JGV0lnRnlUSHhBMm1sLURMTG9hODZQdFhzSjJuTlg4dU9WWEpmcjNTUmVjTl9mT1cyN1U5NGxjM1JQSU40NFNxMloxMWJJRlpIOUFrUlg1M0wybTlIU3RaUF9iTWZwSWV5dHNzdktlN9IBngFBVV95cUxPYzhCR0RYRGVKQVYtdHFqTloza05lTEV6M3hwVmhNUTlSWW1VT1dpZXlmRGJRZHNSdEM0R2t1bG0wWXVOdzd6ZjNWNFV0RVJnVVBqcVBGSTRVYlBvRW5ocHNabnBFUjI2YldwaGIzNXlxMjhQRUdScGJaSjR0dlRLeUdVVTJFalFIYjFwNzdpZ3Q4LUVrVkVJZWs4T0pIZw</guid></item><item><title>Unvaccinated people could not be kept off organ donation list under Alabama bill named for JD Vance relative - AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NCRC4GXRKVFEDJ7653SU3WSFZE"&gt;Alabama state Rep.

&lt;p&gt;Like millions of Americans, I am dyslexic. You would probably never know, unless you happen to be sitting in the passenger seat of my car and find yourself yelling &lt;em&gt;“I said left!”&lt;/em&gt; as I oddly turn right. Then, if you ask me why I turned the wrong way, you will be unable to comprehend that I just can’t remember which side is my right and which is my left. It is simply impossible for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this makes no sense. After all, I have no problem telling the difference between other things. I know up from down. I know black from white. I know forks from spoons. And yet, I do not know left from right. My brain is not wired that way. This is &lt;a href="https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/adults/living-with-a-dyslexic-partner"&gt;true for many dyslexics&lt;/a&gt;, and I suspect multimodal large language models (MLLMs) may be dyslexic too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I describe a recent study that made me question whether MLLMs are dyslexic, let me tell you what it’s like to have the form of dyslexia that I do, and describe what I believe is happening inside my brain. I will also explain why being dyslexic, which makes life difficult for millions of students around the world, can also be a cognitive gift that fosters creativity and innovation.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-with-dyslexia"&gt;Living with dyslexia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1528&amp;amp;context=calpoly_magazine"&gt;a kid with dyslexia,&lt;/a&gt; school was very hard for me. This is because many of the fundamentals that students need to learn were created by people who process spatial information differently than I do. For example, we humans created two lowercase letters in the English alphabet — “b” and “d” — that are only different because one points left and one points right. For decades, I could not tell the difference. This is a very &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6005-dyslexia"&gt;common problem&lt;/a&gt; among dyslexics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many of our math rules use algebraic steps that depend on left-right directionality. The same is true &lt;a href="https://knowledgewords.com/images/an-online-survey-research-regarding-awareness-of-dyscalculia-among-educators-in-sandakan-district-sabah.pdf"&gt;for telling time&lt;/a&gt; on traditional clock faces — it only makes sense if you know the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise. Calendars are hard, too, because the spatial layout depends on the left-right directionality. As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyscalculia/how-can-i-identify-dyscalculia/how-does-dyslexia-affect-maths-learning"&gt;following math rules&lt;/a&gt; and reading clock faces or &lt;a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/f2c239cd61481a2230331b15750cde28/1"&gt;calendars&lt;/a&gt; are common challenges for many dyslexic kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenges don’t end in elementary school. I still remember getting a problem wrong in a physics class during my freshman year at Stanford. There is a simple convention in physics called the “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule"&gt;right-hand rule&lt;/a&gt;” for determining how vectors point. Unfortunately, when I took the test, I used my left hand. That is dyslexia. It has nothing to do with focus or intelligence — your brain just works differently from the people who created the cultural conventions we use in symbolic languages, mathematics, and many branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how is a dyslexic brain different? I can only speak for myself, but having spent years thinking about the odd mix of strengths and weaknesses that come from how I process spatial information, I am pretty sure I know what’s going on. It all relates to the “mind’s eye.” By this, I mean the way I visualize things inside my mind and store spatial elements in memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001002857890004X"&gt;their mind’s eye&lt;/a&gt; is oriented behind the bridge of their nose, looking &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2933036"&gt;out into the world&lt;/a&gt;, unless they make a concerted effort to diverge from that perspective. This makes sense because it’s how our brain receives visual content (i.e., from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2933036/#R30"&gt;first-person perspective&lt;/a&gt;). But when I recall things in my mind (objects, environments, images, or text), I don’t visualize them from a fixed first-person perspective. I think about them from all directions at once, more as a vague &lt;em&gt;cloud of perspectives&lt;/em&gt; than a single, grounded orientation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, if your brain stores a “b” from all perspectives at once, it becomes an identical symbol to a “d.” It’s not that I confuse these two symbols. It’s that they are the same symbol, the only difference being whether you are visualizing each from the front or behind. The same is true of clock faces. How can you remember the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise if you simultaneously imagine the object from many directions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/predicting-the-digital-superpowers-we-could-have-by-2030/"&gt;multimodal large language models&lt;/a&gt; that process and interpret images and videos. These models are remarkable. They can match or exceed human performance on countless tasks, for example, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07814"&gt;diagnosing cancers&lt;/a&gt; from visual slides better than any human. And yet, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05092"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found a surprising result: All major MLLMs currently struggle to tell time on analog clocks. According to the study, GPT-4o was only able to correctly read clock faces 8% of the time. Claude-3-5-sonnet was worse at 6%. Gemini 2.0 was the best, but still at only 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are surprisingly low, especially when you consider that these AI models can perform so well in other contexts. In addition, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05092"&gt;the same study&lt;/a&gt; found that MLLMs also struggle when asked to interpret calendars. This is surprisingly similar to dyslexia in humans, not just in the simple artifacts that cause problems (clocks and calendars), but in the confounding mix of strengths and weaknesses that enables a person like me to earn a PhD and work successfully as a computer scientist and engineer, and yet still fail the “turn left here” test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I move on, I had to test this for myself rather than rely on the academic paper cited above. So, I fired up two popular LLMs and asked them to tell me the number of seconds represented by the red hand on the following clock:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-9.19.15%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="Analog clock showing the time as 1:22, with a white face, black numbers, and hands, with a red second hand." class="wp-image-567043" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the two responses that I got back: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-9.19.39%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="Two explanations about reading a clock's second hand at the 2nd tick mark past the number 2. The first is marked &amp;quot;Gemini Advanced,&amp;quot; and the second, &amp;quot;ChatGPT 4.0." class="wp-image-567044" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is just under 9 seconds, but both LLMs incorrectly reported the number (11 seconds for Gemini and 12 seconds for ChatGPT). This is a surprising error, especially since both LLMs approached the problem correctly by looking at the distance from the “2” on the dial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m pretty sure the LLM can “see” which side of the “2” the second hand is pointing at. So why did both LLMs make this mistake, which happens to be the same type of mistake that I would have made as a kid? Well, if you mix up clockwise and counterclockwise, you might say that it’s “a little &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; the two” if you imagine the hand moving in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this error confounding is how well LLMs perform in other visual tasks. In 2023, I was involved in a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00728"&gt;spatial estimation study&lt;/a&gt; where we asked 240 people to estimate the number of gumballs in a jar from a photograph. The average person made a 55% error. We also asked ChatGPT 4, and it was significantly more accurate, estimating with a 42% error. Clearly, LLMs can outperform humans on complex visuospatial tasks, and yet, the average first-grader is likely better at reading clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-this-teach-us-about-current-ai-systems"&gt;What does this teach us about current AI systems? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it suggests LLMs store and process spatial information so differently than humans, they sometimes struggle with cultural conventions that assume the viewer maintains a particular perspective. When you ask an AI to &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/new-ai-tool-can-diagnose-cancer-guide-treatment-predict-patient-survival/"&gt;interpret a tissue sample&lt;/a&gt; and assess if it’s cancerous, the accuracy is not impacted by orientation. But when you ask it to read a clock face, it has to be conceptualized from a specific direction, or the system will make errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, such errors are considered a “learning disability,” and for millions of dyslexics, it creates daily challenges, especially for kids. That said, the ability to conceptualize the world from unconventional perspectives is also a cognitive gift. It may be one of the reasons why dyslexic people are often highly creative and innovative. In fact, &lt;a href="https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/EJC31680"&gt;research studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that kids with dyslexia score significantly higher on &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dys.1677"&gt;creativity tests&lt;/a&gt; than the general public. In addition, many adult dyslexics credit their “disability” for their success in various fields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am certain my career was &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373978123_Dyslexia_and_Mixed_Reality_Invention"&gt;transformed by dyslexia&lt;/a&gt;. In college, it gave me a deep fascination for how people process spatial information and inspired me to earn a PhD focused on enhancing human perception by adding virtual content to the real world. &lt;span&gt;This led me to the Human Sensory Feedback Group at &lt;a href="https://www.afrl.af.mil/" target="_blank"&gt;Air Force Research Laboratory,&lt;/a&gt; where I developed the first &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/history-of-augmented-reality" target="_blank"&gt;mixed reality system,&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve been working in the fields of VR, AR, and AI ever since.&lt;/span&gt; I’ve heard many similar stories from dyslexics who leverage their unique perspectives to innovate in wildly different fields, from artists and filmmakers to scientists, writers, and even many athletes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As AI systems evolve, I suspect we will learn even more about the benefits and hindrances of perceiving the world in radically different ways. After all, we don’t know how smart AI systems will ultimately become, but we do know they do not learn, think, visualize, or reason in the same ways that our brains do — not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

But there are also other hidden signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.havingbabies.com/physicians/natalia-llarena-md/"&gt;Dr. Natalia Llarena&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified OBGYN and reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist, about what perimenopause actually looks like and why it should be discussed more openly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perimenopause usually happens one to three years before menopause, which marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It varies from person to person but can last for a few months up to several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Llarena said that during perimenopause, many women experience a symptom called menopause flooding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most women grow up hearing about menopause like it's a sudden switch that flips in your 50s — but the reality is way more complicated (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Menopause flooding occurs because, at extremes of reproductive age, ovulation may not occur regularly. A lack of ovulation can cause irregular, heavy bleeding,' she explained to FEMAIL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unpredictable bleeding can occur both in the years immediately following the first period and in the years approaching menopause.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of irregular bleeding, Dr. Llarena listed other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14072963/Im-doctor-common-symptoms-30s-perimenopause.html"&gt;'uncomfortable symptoms' women may experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bleeding that is heavier or lighter than during a typical period, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances, and mood changes, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-99330840-163d-11f0-be0c-899d83a009a2"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,' she listed to DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After a person goes through menopause, they are at increased risk for heart disease, osteoporosis and bone fractures, and vaginal dryness/recurrent urinary tract infections.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another OBGYN, who goes by The Vag Doc on TikTok, also shared a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thevagdoc/video/7491391047008832811"&gt;series &lt;/a&gt;of other shocking symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Joint pain - shoulders, ankles, hands, back - why is this happening?' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you think of estrogen as an anti-inflammatory and sort of like a magical body lubricant for our joints and parts of our body, you're gonna start to realize that all those spots feel better when you have good estrogen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to an OBGYN about what perimenopause actually looks like and why it deserves way more airtime (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When they start to go down, you feel creakier in those spots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said a common phrase regarding perimenopause joint pain is 'frozen shoulder.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second unexpected symptom she included was tinnitus and itching ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Do we totally understand it? No, but the itching in the ear, again, probably because estrogen has something to do with lubricating the tissue so it's getting drier, it's getting flakier, and it's getting itchier,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her third symptom was equally as surprising - burning of the mouth and tongue as well as dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nerve development sort of changes with the loss of estrogen. The dryness is super common, again, because estrogen lubricates our gums and our inner mouth. So you can start to get all these weird sensations in your mouth,' she detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content creator also said some women can have electric shock sensations during perimenopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Little phantom zaps and shocks throughout your body,' she revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People will tell me they get certain really sensitive areas where nothing's going on, it just feels like something is an electric shock to that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In studies, it shows that it is more pronounced when the estrogen levels are going down which we can tell because the periods are getting more irregular.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a woman is in her later productive years, around her late 30s and early 40s, she might experience noticeable changes in her menstrual cycles such as a different flow and a shorter cycle.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Llarena continued: 'Early in the menopausal transition, ovulation becomes less regular, cycles may vary by seven days or more, and then women may begin to notice longer stretches between periods (sometimes 60 days or longer). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is often in this early menopausal transition when some women experience menopause flooding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The OBGYN explained what happens during a period and how our body changes once we start menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have. They peak at 20 weeks of gestation and decline gradually until menopause,' she told FEMAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At 20 weeks of gestation, we have six to seven million eggs, and at the time of menopause, there are fewer than 1,000 eggs remaining. Every month, the brain sends hormonal signals (primarily a hormone called FSH) to the ovaries to stimulate an egg to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In response, the growing follicle produces estrogen and, after ovulation, produces progesterone. This is the hormonal pattern that produces regular periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The estrogen, along with other hormonal signals from the ovaries (a hormone called inhibin), goes back to the brain and tells it that it no longer needs to produce so much FSH because it has responded appropriately to the signal by making estrogen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'In menopause, there are no longer eggs available to grow, and so the ovary no longer makes estrogen in response to the brain's signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In response to the lack of estrogen from the ovaries, the brain continues to produce high levels of FSH. Because the ovaries are no longer making estrogen, estrogen levels are low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the typical hormonal pattern we see in menopause: high FSH and low estrogen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Llarena Falso said that low estrogen is 'responsible for many of the symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For instance, estrogen is thought to play a role in regulating temperature stability in the body,' she expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without it, women become more sensitive to small changes in temperature (this is what scientists call a 'narrowed thermoregulatory zone'), which is one of the reasons women experience hot flashes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:51:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOMUd5OUZLY2cxcUNWYXY2SUVqMnFENHVqWTM5Z0ZQTXo5aXkzRTVMeV9CbGx1bnlVVkd2aWstaTBTQWdvbnZqaVNJWE1EbnViNTNCSk1Kcy01ZTZiUVJxUG1aM0N5cU5oLXhMbWFpYkh5T1JXMlJwOGZzanNhTEdNcmtQTjZGNDBPQUJya0tGYnhmcU9CSGctSnVnaXBaRjhsTkHSAacBQVVfeXFMT21TVFlPY3dCcXJMU1RIZVRmb0xkU3VtNUdBYVpNNmJpRS1oWW43TUZ5TTNMUkhFcS1pR3JOcVRpVzRGU18yaG42UW55ZjdrVWtjd0FrT3UtRktKdTdKN01Na1NvUUhxbG5lUUNuNDZKSUxOQ3B1b1FfN0NTMm1Jd3U1VDR4OVZSSThmUlIzdW95dzktZy1zTFZ4ZUpzbG5FMVhDcDZRZ0k</guid></item><item><title>Republican Has Unbelievably Racist Theory for Measles Outbreak - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOVF9VOFJBc0lIY0RRaWNZVUU3ZlM2Q2JuMDJmVTJpdEFMVzd6S2VtTWstNk1pTk1IM09odDdxM1VOUGxiUS16Y1N5cGo5bGs5ZGd6N015WGdoZE8zNC0yX1hrZ0xvbGJSMERBejdjY3c0T0EwN2FXSkE0SDFoOXFGTjRSbVdGTWJPcUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A Republican lawmaker has a new wildly racist explanation for the deadly measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During a CNN town hall Thursday, Representative Ryan Mackenzie presented his own theory about the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 600;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more than 600&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; confirmed cases of measles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many of these instances that are coming into our country are from illegal immigrants who have crossed the border with no checks, no actual health records, and they are bringing these diseases into our country. There is a reason why measles have started to spread in our country after decades of being almost eradicated,” the Pennsylvania Republican said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last month, Dr. Jennifer Shuford, who oversees the Texas Department of State Health Services, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/03/texas-measles-house-public-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lawmakers that she had no data pinpointing the origin of the outbreak.

    &lt;p&gt;Would you believe me if I told you that staying single or ending your marriage could lower your odds of getting dementia? A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70072"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at Florida State University somewhat shockingly suggests that unmarried people are less likely to develop dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you’ve heard the opposite, you are correct. A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/75/8/1783/5524771?login=true"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; from America found that unmarried people had “significantly higher odds of developing dementia over the study period than their married counterparts”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, married people are generally thought to have better health. Studies have shown that they are at reduced risk of having &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/104/23/1937.short"&gt;heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt; and they tend to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7452000/"&gt;live longer&lt;/a&gt;. So why did the new study come up with this surprising finding? Let’s take a closer look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed data from more than 24,000 Americans without dementia at the start of the study. Participants were tracked for up to 18 years. Crucially, the team compared dementia rates across marital groups: married, divorced, widowed and never-married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it looked as though all three unmarried groups had a reduced risk of dementia compared with the married group. But, after accounting for other factors that could influence the results such as smoking and depression, only divorced and never-married people had a lower risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences were also seen depending on the type of dementia. For example, being unmarried was consistently linked with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet"&gt;common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. But it was not shown for &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vascular-dementia/"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt; – a rarer form of the condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that divorced or never-married people were less likely to progress from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31439020/"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; to dementia and that people who became widowed during the study had a lower risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Possible explanations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for the unexpected results? Married people might be diagnosed earlier because they have spouses who notice memory problems and push for a doctor’s visit. This could make dementia look more common in married people – even if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/801585"&gt;ascertainment bias&lt;/a&gt; — when data is skewed because of who gets diagnosed or noticed more easily. However, the evidence of this was not strong. All participants had annual visits from a doctor, who could be thought of as a proxy partner who would spot early signs of dementia in the participant. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the case that the sample of people used, from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) study, was not representative of the wider population. Specifically, the sample showed low levels of ethnic and income diversity. Also, nearly 64% of the participants were married. This may affect how these unexpected findings translate to the wider world. They could just have been unique to NACC participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is more likely that these findings highlight just how complex the effects of marital disruptions, transitions and choices on brain health really are. Being married is by no means an established protective factor for dementia, with an earlier meta-analysis (a study of studies) showing &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/89/3/231?from=article_link"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt; results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study from Florida State University uses one of the biggest samples to date to examine this issue, and carries a good deal of weight. It highlights that assumptions based on previous research that widowhood and divorce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3151454/"&gt;are very stressful life events&lt;/a&gt; that can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7642953/"&gt;trigger Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; or that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590462/"&gt;unmarried people are socially isolated &lt;/a&gt; and therefore may be at higher risk of dementia, may not always be correct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationship dynamics are by no means straightforward. As mentioned in the paper, such dynamics may “provide a more nuanced understanding than a simple binary effect”. Factors such as marriage quality, levels of satisfaction after divorce, cultural considerations, or the sociability of single people compared with coupled ones may help explain these seemingly contradictory results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study challenges the idea that marriage is automatically good for brain health. Instead, it suggests the effect of relationships on dementia is far more complex. What matters might not be your relationship status but how supported, connected and fulfilled you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

It's preventable if the exposed person or animal receives a series of rabies vaccine shots as soon as possible after exposure, officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans and pets should avoid contact with bats and other animals that can carry rabies, including skunks, foxes, coyotes, and raccoons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone who finds a sick or dead bat in their home or yard should not touch it. To report dead or sick wildlife, call Fremont Animal Services at (510) 790-6635 or Alameda County Vector Control at 510-567-6800. For any human exposure or public health concerns, call the Alameda County Public Health Care Agency at 510-267-3250.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials said preventative measures to reduce risk include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate all dogs and cats against rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep dogs confined to your property, especially puppies under 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report animal bites of humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid feeding or handling wild animals, even if they appear sick or injured.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove outdoor pet food, which can attract skunks and other wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate hiding spots by clearing trash, woodpiles, dense vegetation, and hollow logs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bat-proof your home by sealing any openings larger than ¼ inch, especially near the roof. Use ¼-inch mesh to screen attic vents and keep them well-maintained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also See:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Shooting In Fremont Leaves One Injured" href="https://patch.com/california/fremont/shooting-fremont-leaves-one-injured" class="styles_CardCondensed__TitleLink__a_1Oq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shooting In Fremont Leaves One Injured&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://patch.com/california/fremont/2-fire-victims-idd-coroner" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Fire Victims Identified By Coroner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copyright © 2025 Bay City News, Inc.

But she remained awake and upright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t fall. I wasn’t on the floor, but I realized I had dropped the jewelry, and my brain was really confused,” Kaluza, 43, of El Campo, Texas tells TODAY.com. “I look up at the camera because I knew my husband was (watching), and I tried to say, ‘I need help,’ and it wouldn’t come out. I couldn’t turn my body. I felt super heavy. I couldn’t really lift my arms.” Her husband recognized that his wife was having a stroke and called 911. But when she got to the hospital, staff didn’t consider that she’d had a stroke at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people at the hospital ... said, ‘You’re so young,’” she recalls. “I come to find out when we finally get to the neurologist … it was a stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kristie Kaluza, 42, suddenly couldn't speak or move during a TikTok live.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unexpected stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 10, 2025, Kaluza returned home in the early evening and prepared for a TikTok Live to sell her jewelry. She had a normal Friday until she sat down in front of the camera and started feeling strange. When she tried to speak, she couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a miscommunication, a misfire there somewhere, and I couldn’t get out that, ‘Hey I don’t feel good,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, her husband rushed in and recognized the signs of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I knew then something was not right,’” Kaluza says. “If he hadn’t have looked down when he did and seen that I dropped the jewelry and I wasn’t acting right, I wouldn’t have been able to call out for help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after he called 911, Kaluza started experiencing tremors in her head and hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was one of the scariest things, not being able to say my words and not having control of my head or my hands,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley Kaluza, her husband, knew the signs of stroke because his mother recently experienced one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Stroke Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Stroke Association&lt;/a&gt;, the signs of stroke, which spell out FAST, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kaluza arrived at the nearby hospital quickly, it didn’t have an MRI machine, so she couldn’t undergo the scan to see if she’d had a stroke. Her CT scan looked normal, but doctors transferred her to another hospital so she could get an MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that hospital wouldn’t perform an MRI because she has a spinal cord stimulator implanted in her back to relieve pain, and they worried it would be unsafe in the MRI, she says. She had the remote to put it in MRI safety mode with her, but they still refused, Kaluza adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital injected her with a blood-thinning medication, which can break up a blood clot. She was released and underwent an outpatient MRI. The doctor who performed it determined what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The neurologist says, ‘Well, we see in the MRI with the contrast you had a stroke,’” Kaluza says. “My husband says, ‘Wait, you are saying she had a full-blown stroke?’ And the neurologist said, ‘Yes, she did have a small one.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, she’d experienced a transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini stroke, which occurs when the blockage of blood flow to the brain is brief and doesn’t cause lasting symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transient-ischemic-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20355679" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurologist sent Kaluza to a cardiologist to understand why she had a stroke at a young age. After a variety of tests, she learned she had a hole between the upper chambers of her heart, what’s known as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A PFO is something we all have when we’re in our fetal development,” Dr. Daniel Hermann, director of structural cardiology at Memorial Hermann Memorial City, who treated Kaluza, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, “probably about 90-95%,” the hole closes, he says. For the remaining patients, the hole remains open. Most people are unaware of it and live a symptom-free life. But in some, like Kaluza, that opening allows a clot to pass through and cause stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For 43 years, I’ve lived with the hole in my heart and never knew, never had any symptoms,” Kaluza says. “Just a hole in (my) heart from being born caused a stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PFO treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people might experience migraines from a PFO, most people have few signs that they have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you have symptoms from,” Hermann says. “It causes no structural issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When younger patients, people typically under 60, experience stroke, doctors sometimes find a PFO as the cause. Patients can take blood thinners to reduce clots, but that can cause people to bleed excessively if they injure themselves, for example. Doctors like Hermann often perform an outpatient procedure to fix the PFO instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the last decade or so, it’s become clear that the most effective way of reducing stroke risk related to a PFO is actually closing it,” he explains. “That’s typically done using a catheter-based approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the minimally invasive procedure, a doctor threads a catheter through a vein in the groin and inserts a “small plug” into the catheter, which they use to block the opening between the heart chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something that typically takes too much time and it’s something that’s very effective as far as closing the hole and preventing further strokes,” Hermann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaluza should be able to do everything she enjoys without any worry of a future stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Her risk of stroke after having this taken care of it essentially returns her back to any other person … that is of her age,” Hermann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Kaluza underwent her PFO closure on March 4, she has been feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can do everything that I could do before,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she struggles cognitively at times, and she can’t find the right words or says in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When my brain works a lot … it starts to get tired,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Kaluza wonders what would have happened if her husband didn’t see she was having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(It’s) very, very scary,” she says. “I don’t know how long I would have sat here not being able to move and not being able to call out (for help).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaluza hopes that her story encourages others to act quickly if they see someone experiencing stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew what to look for and we called and got help quickly,” she says. “That’s what I want people to learn, how to look for stroke, what to do, how to get help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE81cVdKQ3I2MldLSk9XeHMwcGNqUUlVQ1hzV29NTWxSU2NMSXBVaXZUMElZWUdDQm5tTExnQjRmLWtPSEFKVEhCUG14SnpYdnFCWV9Lb2syZk9WQzE4UzlEQWczVmsxSW5NOWNQc3QxNEFHdlZlekVfZg</guid></item><item><title>The Power (and Pitfalls) of a High-Protein Diet - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPLTlESUdWczJjUVd4YjJvWGF2RmxNMUxUR2JiMEdhT0VsejJCVjV3M1BtTzZPNjJWamJOVFFvNVN5bkVVSVl6TE8xNmdUSUhUZ0llX0RwMWEzM1Z4bUZuM25BZ1M3WExVM1FUUjM2aENMaGJDUE1pcVZvSFh5UGd3alF0RkVzeFpJbGl0MXJwZi11TmtkeDluUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

              'This is day 312 eating nothing but meat, eggs, and seafood. Today is officially week six of the carnivore diet. Whatever you think you know about protein, how much to eat, what kind to eat might be wrong. Four, six ounce tri-tip  sirloin steaks. Six scrambled eggs. Leftover butter and tallow. Always eat more protein, high protein. Typical protein is nasty.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There is no question about it. Protein is having a real moment, and food companies have caught onto this. That's why you're now seeing protein in everything from chips to cereal. As I think most of our listeners know by now, whenever there's some sort of health fad trending, we like to take a closer look. On today's show, we're diving into the world of what's now being called protein mania. We're gonna get you some answers to questions like, how much protein do you actually need? How much is too much? Is all protein created equal? Can you get enough protein as a vegetarian or a vegan? And I'll even give you some specific ideas for your next breakfast. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life. All right, full disclosure, I approach most trends with some healthy skepticism. But at the same time, don't get me wrong, I think a lot about protein. Protein is essential. So let me give you a few basics. Our diets are made up of three main macronutrients, protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Now, from a purely scientific perspective, we need protein and fat to survive. Carbs, less so. Now, what's so special about protein? It is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, which our bodies need to function. Amino acids help with everything from building and maintaining muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting your immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. So yeah, I wanna put that out there because protein goes way beyond just bulking up muscle. But there is another side to this as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I was in LA and I did some interviews there and nine out of 10 people I asked, what do you have for breakfast? It was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing. They've been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they're somehow deficient and they're not gonna be lean and have a six pack and be running marathons.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Today's guest is Dr. Tim Spector. He's a genetic epidemiologist, researcher, and the author of several books that have shaped the way many of us think about our diets.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Nutrition has gone from being the most boring science, and doctors never used to want to know about it, as you probably remember, to one of the most exciting topics that really we can discuss because it's suddenly caught the public's imagination. Everyone's interested in it. And in the U.S., the current trend of interest is everyone's obsessed with protein.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, we talk about nutrition quite a bit. And one of the things that struck me, Dr. Spector, when I started doing this was, I felt like people generally know how to eat well. And maybe I'm being a little too conciliatory towards this, but I think as a general rule, you should eat your fruits and vegetables. You shouldn't eat too much. You shouldn' eat too many processed foods. They know that and yet they don't. Is this a education problem? Is this an access problem? Why despite the fact that people generally know how to eat? Well, do they not do it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I think it's a combination of factors. I think, it's fantastic marketing by the big food companies to cloud the issue and make people think they're eating healthy foods when in fact they're not. And it's also a lack of access. You don't have to go very far in the U S to see these food deserts. Or if you're on the road, traveling through airports and railway stations, gas stations. You don't have any choice. It's like the only things to eat are rubbish ultra processed food. So it's that combination really of it being made really difficult for the average American to eat well. Plus the fact that although they know the really bad foods are bad for them, they're sort of tempted to have these other foods that have a lot of these health halos on them. unbeknownst to them, making them overeat. And I think this is where the battleground really is. It is in, it's not fighting Coca-Cola or Pepsi, it's fighting the healthier versions of them, the diet drinks, it the low-fat foods, it's the high-protein snacks that have brilliant marketing behind them, brilliant food chemists making them taste delicious and distorting that. original view that people know that fruit and vegetables are good. Ultra processed food is bad. And they think, okay, I'm getting this high protein snack bar. It says it's low in fat. Oh, I've heard that's good. It's high in protein. I've heard that even better. I'm going to buy it. And the fact that it's packed with 20 chemicals, they don't want it's going to mess up their gut. They don't know that never before in history of people being attacked on all distort what they know is true and twist it, so that the companies will use that information. Oh, this snack bar contains real fruit, right? So, oh, ting, I remember, fruit is good for me. That's one of the top three reasons people buy junk food is because they see a little signal in there to say, oh, I'm gonna buy that. A little health halo, as you call it. Yeah, and currently protein is the health halo. par excellence in the US. We like to simplify things and that's, and nothing's truer than in nutrition. That's why we reach for the magic vitamin pill or supplement while we dumb everything. A very complex science like nutrition down to a simple thing like, what am I going for this? Okay, I'm going for my protein.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              It sounds like there's two issues that you're sort of raising. One is that they're wrong and that they probably don't need to think of trying to get that much protein into their bodies, but also what they're giving up to do it. They're giving out more fruits and vegetables in search of all that.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm not saying protein's bad, very little evidence. You have to take a lot of it for it to be harmful. So in general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it's plant protein, but nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation, but it's what it replaces. We need to start thinking much more holistically. And this is what I've been sort of preaching in my books is the idea that whenever you add too much of something, you can't get the rest of it. studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein. They're getting a lot. There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount. And yet 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber. And, yet, nobody's fighting the corner of fiber, Because there's no money. There's no money in that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And so that is this a fad, do you think, right now? Or is this something that is sort of a pendulum swing? Or is there something that we're going to see more and more of?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, I think it's a fad until people realize that you can't store protein. So you either pee it out or it just gets converted to fat. And so if you're not spending three hours in the gym, which I guess you and I are not, then
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              I can't see. You've got a very dark shirt. So you you could have huge muscles that are hidden from me at the moment. I can see that it could just be two hours, you know, I think. But I think it's in part being driven by marketing for particularly teenage boys who are into fitness and bodybuilding. There's a big craze about body awareness and muscles and protein and gyms all across all across the country. It's a bit of a zeitgeist moment that everyone's thinking about fitness. They're thinking about how do you build muscle? You've got Americans on a Ozempic. They're losing muscle when they lose fat. So they're thinking about protein for good reasons. So I think it's going to be here for a while. It's not, it's not just a few months. It appropriate with us for a few years. And I think it will settle down to people actually slowly getting ready for the truth. And they'll realize that If they've been on these high protein diets for a year or so, the rest of that other health will start to suffer.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              How much protein should we be eating? And I will tell you that I spoke to my own doctor about this recently. I do exercise every day. I'm not a big bodybuilder, but I do exercise every and he told me roughly about a gram per kilo. So a gram for roughly two pounds of weight I should be getting in protein. Does that sound right to you?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, I think it does. The US recommendations are actually a bit lower than that. They're about 0.83. Most countries have that, but that's really for more sedentary people. So the more exercise you're it plays to play safe. And I think for most people, a gram per kilo is about right. As you do more exercise, then it can creep up probably to a maximum. If you're a professional athlete of around 1.6 where you are doing per kilo. Yes. So it's titrating it in a way to your levels. Other people that might need more than one... people who are losing weight. So if you're losing weight, you're not eating much. So the reason you just need one is you're eating a reasonable amount of food and people who eat a reasonable food, whether they choose to or not, are going to get protein. You get protein just from eating spaghetti. It's in wheat, it's in corn, it it's in things that you don't necessarily think about, not just eggs and meat. you're eating a lot, you will be getting plenty of protein for you. But if you're not, you're on a diet or you're sick or you are losing weight, you'll need extra amounts. It's complicated. There are people out there on social media saying you need over two grams per kilo, which is crazy amounts. That means you'll be eating over 50% of all your food as protein. and it's virtually impossible to eat that it makes you very sick and nauseous to actually have that much protein as well. Anything at excessive levels mean that all your nutritional scores from any new any proper nutritionist would score them very badly.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So that's roughly for the US audience. So it's roughly 2 pounds, 2.2 pounds and a kilo. So you're saying roughly half a gram of protein per pound.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So if you weigh 150 pounds, 75 grams, 200 pounds, 100 grams of protein a day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And that's, that's being generous because it's, it's slightly under half. So it's it works out that way. So most people don't have to worry that they're already getting more than enough. And partly this is because the Americans eat more meat than virtually any other country in the world, twice the European average. So they're getting a lot of protein already. And it's in a lot ultra processed foods as well through soybeans and are the things that people don't think about.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'Okay, let's take a short break here. When we come back, I'm gonna ask Dr. Spector if where we get our protein matters, meaning whether you're plant-based or a carnivore. Dr. Spector has mentioned a couple of times that most of us aren't getting enough fiber, and he's definitely right about that. Federal guidelines call for adult men to get around 28 to 34 grams of fiber for women between 25 to 28 grams. For some context, that's roughly the amount of fiber in a can of black beans. Now, if you are looking to get more fiber, one thing that you're probably doing is turning to plants. But, can plants help us meet our fiber goals? and at the same time, our protein goals. I asked Dr. Spector, are all proteins created equal? You mentioned soy, for example, so soy versus a piece of meat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'Meat and eggs have pretty much the perfect balance of the amino acids for your body. We have these proteins made up of these building blocks, which are amino acids, and we have a certain number of them called essential ones, which we can only get through our The rest we can make in our cells and our body. And meat has the perfect balance of these, but plants have all of them. the balance in any one plant is slightly different. But if you have a range of plants, you will get the equivalent amounts and range and everything adequate as you would by having meat. But the misconception is that if you take one plant, you say like soy or you take rice or one bean, it's not going to have the perfect balance of all those amino acids. so you would, if you only yet. that one food exclusively, you might end up being deficient eventually in one of these. So that's why it's a rather strange debate, because nobody actually eats like this. If you're sensible and you're eating a varied plant diet, you don't necessarily need meat to get all the protein you need. But you do need a variety of-

              And the nice thing is that there are lots of plants that are very rich in proteins, particularly things like the legumes, most of the beans and lentils. And they have very high levels of protein in them as well. But the bonus is you're also getting fiber. So when you eat meat, which is packed with protein, you're getting no fiber. So you're not really getting things that are gonna improve your gut health, your immune system, et cetera. So it's a big misconception. it's why. The meat lobby in the US is so big that the carnivore diet people, they just say, well, plants are inferior. Well, any one plant might be, but you add them all together and they're far superior.

And then I had some, sprinkled on some berries. I had nuts and seeds, which I have as a mix to give me a variety of, there's plenty of protein in nuts and seats. People forget that. really healthy fats and proteins there. Small amount of carbs. That tends to be what I eat. I tend to have meat once or twice a month and fish maybe once a week. And that's for a variety of reasons, but mainly it's the main thing I can do for the environment and the planet, which I feel we should do, but I think it's also important for my health. What I'm trying to do is give myself the room so I can have 30 different plants during my week. And that's that diversity of plants, which I think is probably the most crucial rule for nutrition. And I think a little bit of everything is probably a pretty good rule. And we shouldn't be demonizing things like saying, well, meat is deadly or proteins either good or bad, or fiber is bad for you.

              'There's been a big debate going on in the United States, as you may know, about seed oils versus animal fat oils, such as beef tallow and even butter and things like that. For me, because of the family history of heart disease, I think I was warded off these saturated fat oils. That was something that just became part of my way of life. I'm not somebody who cooks with a lot of butter, for example, or certainly we don't use beef tallows. But now it's becoming a thing Those types of plant-based oils versus the saturated fat oils, how do you think about that?

              Well, there's been a lot of hype on social media about these seed oils, mainly from people who aren't experts in the area. And I'm not an expert in the air, but I work with a colleague called Dr. Sarah Berry, who is a world expert in fats and health. And I listened to what she says, and she says there is no real evidence that seed oils are bad for you. high quality human clinical trials. All the evidence is based on very poor data in animals and in test tube studies, which you can prove anything if you want to. So we should go with a big epidemiological evidence. We should go over the clinical trials, and when we do, we don't see anything particularly wrong with these seed oils. So they shouldn't be demonized in that way, but within them, there's obviously differences. You always wanna go for the higher quality ones. shouldn't just throw everything out because you've seen something on TikTok saying that they're deadly. That's just another yet another fad that's going to go. But we should be worried about getting everyone to go back to eating beef tallow. I think that is very much too much saturated fat. And there's no evidence that is good for you. Butter, I do like butter. But if you had a choice, you should cook and eat with extra virgin olive oil, because that has proven health benefits beyond any doubt. So, again, it's always a question of instead of what, which which never gets the nuance on on a 60 second TikTok, you know, it like, we're just demonizing this because of one study. done in Taiwan 10 years ago in a test tube and some big influencer is getting on their high horse about it. It's all really nonsense. So, CEDARS are not deadly, but we should be worrying about the ones that are in our ultra processed foods, the really cheap stuff, the palm oils, the eating too much coconut oil. They are the wrong side of saturated fats you should be avoiding, but. We need to react, not overreact when someone says this particular product is deadly. Usually that's wrong, but it's much more nuanced than that. And we need to rely on the experts rather than just listening to influences. So that's, but that's very hard for, it is very hard for the public though, because they're bombarded with all this stuff.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And like you said, these health halo messages and all that, people have a hard time finding sources of good information about this stuff that's based on data presented with humility, as I think you're alluding to as well. I mean, none of this is absolutely straightforward. And I notice you're not dogmatic about any of this stuff.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              No, I've changed my mind several times, and I think it's as a journey that myself and the companies are led by science. And so if a new study comes out that changes our way of thinking, we change things. And we've just got a new score coming out about ultra processed food that was used to be scored in a very crude way, just with additives. But you realize that not all ultra processed foods are bad. And some of them, just because they contain one little chemical additive. Like ascorbic acid, people were labeling it as deadly, but actually that's not true. And that's just vitamin C. And there's the biggest obstacle to health in the US is this bombardment with all this signaling about vitamins and protein and low fat and low calorie and all this. It's a minefield to work through. So I think we realize this is the time. Everyone wants to learn about nutrition. They're no longer going to their doctor. saying, I'll just do whatever he or she says. I think people want to learn themselves. So I think this is an exciting time, really, for us to change the way we think about food. And that's really my mission is just think about it differently. And I've certainly gone full circle since I was a doctor, I got it completely wrong then. And I'm very happy to keep saying I'm happy to keep making mistakes as long as I get it right again.
            &lt;/p&gt;

It later transpired she was 'really, really sick'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would feel like I have to poo, but nothing was coming out. And when it would come out, it wouldn't be formed. It would be a blob.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In light of all of these symptoms, Byrd decided to weigh herself, and that's when she discovered she had lost almost 100lbs without trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight had dropped from a high of 270lbs, following the birth of her son, to 198lbs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to find out what was behind her mounting health issues, Byrd went to see her primary care doctor in May 2022, but tests - which included an abdominal ultrasound - were inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then referred to a gastroenterologist, who immediately started quizzing her about there being a history of colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-25459c90-164c-11f0-b6a3-bd51023251db"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'I told [the doctor] my symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He asked me if there was anyone in my family that had colon cancer, and I told him about my uncle who had died several years prior from colon cancer. We scheduled my colonoscopy for July.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd said her worst fears came true when she woke up from the procedure - which takes up to an hour to complete - and she saw the look on her doctor's face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After frantically asking him what was wrong, Byrd was informed that she was 'really, really sick' and at that point, she remembers screaming and the medical staff rushing to get her husband, Roysi.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors revealed that they had discovered a 'pretty big' rectal mass and Byrd was then referred to an oncologist for a CT scan and MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These scans revealed that she had a tumor the 'size of a golf ball' and that it was stage three colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant the disease had spread beyond the lining of the colon and into nearby lymph nodes, but not to distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how she felt about the devastating diagnosis at the time, Byrd said: 'Of course, when you hear 'cancer,' you're thinking death or that it's something that you're not going to survive. That's what I was thinking. I was 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Byrd, pictured in 2018 before her cancer battle, hopes her story will inspire other young people to go and checked out as soon as they feel something isn't quite right with their bodies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started thinking about my son - he was only two years old, and my daughter and my husband - I don't know what life would be if God took me right now. I started praying and asking God, 'What do you need me to do?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had so many things that I wanted to still accomplish. I have to be here for my children and my husband. I had recently lost my mom and I knew how bad it felt. I know they need me. So I had to fight. I had to.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After having a surgery to remove the majority of the tumor, Byrd underwent chemotherapy in October 2022, which saw her weight plummet further to around 140lbs as she was hit by major fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also lost her appetite as the chemotherapy made 'everything taste like metal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following chemotherapy, Byrd started radiation which took her to March 2023 and she had another surgery to remove the rest of her tumor around four months later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was at that point, the medical team declared Byrd cancer-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a temporary ostomy bag fitted for about a year while she healed from the surgery and one more round of chemotherapy lasting for three months to ensure the disease didn't return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout her cancer journey, Byrd says her family has been her rock and her husband 'wore all of the hats when I needed him to'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she is now cancer-free, there are some side effects that will never leave her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-two says: 'Even now, after having everything done and my cancer being in remission, I still have the abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I still feel like I have to go to the restroom every five minutes and nothing happens as far as my bowels moving. They say that won't ever go away for me because of where the tumor was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd hopes her story will inspire other young people to go and checked out as soon as they feel something isn't quite right with their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends that adults who are at an average risk for colon cancer begin screening at age 45 and then receive a colonoscopy once every 10 years until age 75 if they are in generally good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for those with a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors, screening may need to begin as early as age 40 or even earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd concludes: 'If you have a family member that had colon cancer, even if it's not in your immediate family, advocate for yourself at the doctor's office and tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm happy that I went to the doctor, and I did not wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer is something that you can't predict. We only have one life to live. So if my journey can help somebody else, then I'm here for it, because we all deserve to be here and enjoy life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:41:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQdXczVGNRM2V3UWk3MElfdkw2ZUZtZ19oVmdBRjltblBiZUNjOWJ3Z20zcDRyZGp0Z1hoVDl1UV9tanVBVGtMdTRuWlFjM3I5N2wxSUt1S3NYazRiaTRWaG9SN3pfTHpBOGJEdlVQcDZqMktCWmRISWE1UlkxaXM3bThKRlJTMm1nc1ItUkFuNWZ5YXBxd2lQTFI5bFdhYUpWQ0HSAacBQVVfeXFMTS1hbnRoRkZob2NjRnpyRUd6YjdUOW16YWxpVy1xY3JHczMyVmtvVlZQRTBYTHJVcGxhZ3h5aUp3WjAtaTJOZGx3dTNSQmloZFdXc2dLZHEycHg3RncyNlNDYm1HTi1YS0hnTkpBTXY0Y3IzcFNUaXE4Zzk5ZGpabUdsX21LX2FuN1pHdFo0ZFcxM2xCNEZRZi1qMjZreDFNOHhiUUFtbDg</guid></item><item><title>AAN 2025: Tavapadon offers rapid, sustained motor benefits - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPUTZqdVc4OERlc2VBT3Rudmg0U1RkTmlpcDFzRmJDR2llQUM1c1g3dmRrNGhnc3JjVTI2MDZhTzN0a1BUbUpWcHY2RjVqdXRkUUlidV9wemJOd1pXZHNnQlFQWmk1UV9sYWhxcGZ3cGpTTmJPcGpKZ3hPTVI5TjNrUThIYzRmUk4zMnVpVXUzdnUwekNod2dwTTNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavapadon, an orally available small molecule being developed for &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, was generally safe and eased motor symptoms within one month of being administered at either a fixed or flexible dose to adults with early-stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also reduced the risk of common side effects typically associated with similar classes of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data come from &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04201093"&gt;TEMPO-1 (NCT04201093)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04223193"&gt;TEMPO-2 (NCT04223193)&lt;/a&gt;, two Phase 3 clinical trials that tested the efficacy and safety of tavapadon compared with a placebo in adults with mild to moderate &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; who had received minimal to no previous treatment for Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer &lt;a href="https://www.abbvie.com"&gt;Abbvie&lt;/a&gt; has said it plans to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/tavapadons-flexible-dose-eases-symptoms-early-parkinsons/"&gt;file for regulatory approval of Tavapadon&lt;/a&gt; based on the data, detailed in two oral presentations during the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting, held April 5–9 in San Diego and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A key unmet need in Parkinson’s disease is finding a treatment modality that can balance the good effects of dopamine stimulation while still reducing the dopaminergic side effects,” Hubert Fernandez, MD, director of the Center for Neurological Restoration at Cleveland Clinic, said during his presentation, “&lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/msa/Public/Events/AbstractDetails/61460"&gt;Efficacy and Safety of Flexible-Dose Tavapadon, an Orally Administered, Once-Daily, Selective D1/D5 Partial Dopamine Agonist for the Treatment of Early Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Extension study testing flexible dose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2 have concluded, an open-label extension, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04760769"&gt;TEMPO-4 (NCT04760769)&lt;/a&gt;, is ongoing to test the long-term safety and efficacy of flexible-dose tavapadon. Abbvie has also sponsored &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04542499"&gt;TEMPO-3 (NCT04542499)&lt;/a&gt;, which tested tavapadon as an add-on to levodopa in people with late-stage Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; result from the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, that plays a key role in regulating motor control. The standard &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/"&gt;treatment for Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; typically involves levodopa, a precursor that helps replenish dopamine levels in the brain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abbvie.com/science/pipeline.html#tavapadon"&gt;Tavapadon&lt;/a&gt; is a dopamine agonist designed to partially activate D1 and D5 dopamine receptors on nerve cells, mimicking the effects of dopamine to help alleviate motor symptoms. By selectively targeting the D1 and D5 receptors, tavapadon may also reduce the risk of side effects typically associated with broader dopamine receptor activation, which include dyskinesias — involuntary, erratic movements — as well as hallucinations and impulse control disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TEMPO-2 clinical trial involved 304 patients, with a mean age of 62.9, who had been &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for less than three years. They were randomly assigned to receive either tavapadon or a placebo once daily for 27 weeks (slightly longer than six months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tavapadon dose was adjusted to find the highest each patient could tolerate, from 5 mg to 15 mg once daily. The main goal was to watch for changes in a Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts 2 and 3 combined score, a measure of motor symptoms’ severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment with tavapadon resulted in a significantly greater decrease in the average MDS-UPDRS combined score compared with the placebo (10.3 points vs. 1.2 points). In the MDS-UPDRS, a lower score indicates less severe motor symptoms. The difference between the two groups was apparent in four weeks (about a month) and sustained until the end of the observation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flexible dosing of tavapadon demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the motor function in early Parkinson’s patients,” Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most side effects were transient and mild to moderate in severity. The most common side effects were nausea, headache, and dizziness. Somnolence, a common side effect linked to activation of dopamine receptors other than D1 and D5, occurred at similar rates in the tavapadon and placebo groups. Hallucinations and impulse control disorders were reported in 4% and 2% of patients treated with tavapadon, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Fixed-dose trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the TEMPO-1 clinical trial, which tested two fixed doses of tavapadon, 5 mg or 15 mg, or a placebo, given once daily, were outlined in the presentation, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/msa/Public/Events/AbstractDetails/61461"&gt;Efficacy and Safety of Fixed-Dose Tavapadon, an Oral, Once-Daily, Selective D1/D5 Partial Dopamine Agonist for the Treatment of Early Parkinson’s Disease,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;” by Rajesh Pahwa, MD, a professor of neurology at the University of Kansas Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial enrolled 529 patients, mean age 63.7, and as in the TEMPO-2 trial, the study’s main goal was to watch for changes in the MDS-UPDRS combined score at week 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in the 5 mg group had an average reduction of 11.5 points, and those in the 15 mg group had an average reduction of 12.1 points in the MDS-UPDRS combined score when compared with those given a placebo. As in the TEMPO-1 trial, this difference between the two groups was observed after a month and sustained until the end of the observation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects were consistent with those observed in the TEMPO-2 trial. Hallucinations were reported in 6.2% of participants receiving the 15 mg dose, but none in the 5 mg group. Rates of somnolence were comparable across both treatment groups and the placebo. Dyskinesias occurred in 1.7% of participants on the 15 mg dose, with no cases reported at the 5 mg dose. Impulse control disorders occurred in 0.6% and 1.1% of those in the 15 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the efficacy of both doses was similar, the side effect profile was slightly higher in the 15 mg group. “Looking at our study, I would say the 5 mg shows the best efficacy and the side effect profile,” Pahwa said. However, he noted, the trial was not designed to directly compare the two doses, but rather to evaluate each against a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are encouraged by the positive results from the TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2 trials, which highlight tavapadon’s potential as a novel, once-daily oral treatment for early Parkinson’s disease,” Pavnit Kukreja, therapeutic area lead, Parkinson’s, at Abbvie, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;Parkinson’s News Today&lt;/em&gt;. “The significant improvements in motor symptoms … support tavapadon’s efficacy and its favorable safety profile, aligning with our commitment at AbbVie to advance meaningful treatment options. As we progress towards our goal of submitting a New Drug Application, we remain dedicated to addressing the diverse needs of the Parkinson’s community at every stage of their journey.”&lt;/p&gt;

            A genetically engineered pig kidney helped Towana Looney enjoy 130 days without the need for dialysis before the organ was removed last week. It’s the longest a human has ever lived with a pig organ,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;marking another step forward in the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation, or the practice of transplanting animal organs into humans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00043b6mkxerxdbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney, a 53-year-old-woman from Alabama, had been on dialysis for nine years before she received the pig kidney transplant in late November, becoming only the &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/9teig" target="_blank"&gt;third person&lt;/a&gt; to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00053b6mg4h29mw0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She left the hospital 11 days after surgery at NYU Langone Transplant Institute, staying at an apartment near the hospital so she could get checkups every day. But medical complications developed after months of stability, leading to the difficult decision to remove the organ on April 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00063b6m0c7hbs89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In early April, she had a reduction in renal function due to acute rejection. What triggered the rejection episode after a long period of stability is being actively investigated, but it followed a lowering of her immunosuppression regimen to treat an infection unrelated to the pig kidney,” Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute and chair of NYU Langone Health’s surgery department, said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00073b6m9oambug9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision was made by Ms. Looney and her doctors that the safest intervention would be to remove the kidney and return to dialysis rather than giving additional immunosuppression. This preserves future possibilities for transplantation for her as knowledge and innovations progress,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00083b6mgig5vddw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            United Therapeutics Corporation, the biotech company that developed the modified pig kidney – known as a UKidney – celebrated the bravery and enthusiasm Looney has shown throughout the xenotransplantation journey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cox7ur00003b6mvmz3si5d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the biggest challenges for transplant recipients – human-to-human or pig-to-human – is the prevention and management of infections while simultaneously balancing the level of immunosuppression medications required to prevent rejection, especially in the first months after surgery,” the company said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cp465400033b6mfrqhvyiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will learn more about the circumstances that led to removal of the UKidney, but current evidence suggests that the UKidney functioned well up until the time of rejection, which appears to have occurred due to a reduction in immunosuppression while treating infection unrelated to the xenokidney,” they said. “We expect physicians at NYU will share their findings in a peer-reviewed publication in the future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00093b6mcg7aamto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney donated a kidney to help save her mother’s life in 1999 but later developed kidney failure after her remaining kidney was damaged by preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy complication involving persistent high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000a3b6mttmlsu6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After years on the waitlist for an organ transplant, she began to develop problems associated with chronic dependence on dialysis. Without a donor match, she would die – but the complications she had developed made it more difficult to find one. When she heard about the option to try a pig kidney transplantation, she jumped at the chance to try it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000b3b6mau83kefp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Without a pathway to receiving a human kidney, she decided a gene-edited pig kidney was worth a try, and a lot of people rallied around her decision, including her husband and family,” Montgomery said at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000c3b6mso9vynt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney is now back home in Alabama and says she’s grateful for the opportunity she had to participate in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000d3b6mbn6030iu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time since 2016, I enjoyed time with friends and family without planning around dialysis treatments,” she said in a statement. “Though the outcome is not what anyone wanted, I know a lot was learned from my 130 days with a pig kidney – and that this can help and inspire many others in their journey to overcome kidney disease. I remain thankful to all of the doctors and researchers at NYU Langone for all they are doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            More than 90,000 people in the United States are on the waitlist to receive a kidney transplant, according to &lt;a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, accounting for the vast majority of people waiting to receive an organ donation. The average wait time for a kidney is &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/kidney-transplant-waitlist#:~:text=Once%20you%20are%20on%20the%20transplant%20waiting%20list%2C%20you%20may,Where%20you%20live" target="_blank"&gt;three to five years&lt;/a&gt; at most centers, and about 13 people die each day &lt;a href="https://unos.org/media-resources/releases/over-30-kidney-donors-and-advocates-to-celebrate-world-kidney-day-from-the-top-of-mount-kilimanjaro/#:~:text=Roughly%2013%20people%20die%20each,as%2075%20through%20tissue%20donation." target="_blank"&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt;.

            Dialysis – a procedure to help remove waste and extra fluid from the blood – can be helpful in the short term but can do only 10% to 15% of what a &lt;a href="https://www.kidneyfund.org/treatments/dialysis#:~:text=It%20helps%20your%20body%20remove,what%20a%20normal%20kidney%20does." target="_blank"&gt;healthy kidney&lt;/a&gt; does, and people on dialysis have a 50% chance of dying in the five years after they start the treatment, &lt;a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney/need/statistics#:~:text=After%20one%20year%20of%20treatment,about%2080%25%20after%205%20years." target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.

            The US Food and Drug Administration allows doctors to transplant organs from pigs into humans under what’s commonly known as “compassionate use,” which permits use of an experimental therapy or procedure if “comparable or satisfactory” options aren’t available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000h3b6mq95j2vho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pigs’ organs are similar to humans’, and the speed of pigs’ reproduction means their organs can be procured quickly. Scientists can edit the genes of the pig to reduce the risk that a human body will reject its organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Looney was the first to receive a kidney with 10 gene edits, and United Therapeutics &lt;a href="https://ir.unither.com/press-releases/2025/02-03-2025-120011819" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in February that it was cleared by the FDA to use this type of pig kidney in the first human clinical trials to study xenotransplantation. The company says they are in regular contact with the FDA about this and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;expect to perform the first of six initial transplants in people with end-stage kidney disease in the middle of 2025, with the intent of expanding the trial to a total of 50 patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some experts foresee pig kidney transplant becoming an established option for patients within a decade, a major advancement that would be possible because of people like Looney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Towana’s willingness to endeavor into the unknown to help solve the nation’s organ shortage crisis will impact many more lives after her. We celebrate her tremendous courage and sacrifice,” Montgomery said. “She lived with a pig kidney longer than any other human in history, and the field has learned a great deal from her. Her contribution has furthered the hope and promise of genetically engineered pig organs as an alternative source to human organs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            United Therapeutics echoed the same sentiment.

            “Mrs. Looney’s bravery has enabled major advancements in the field of xenotransplantation and adds to the foundational insights made possible by the contributions of other patients. Her case will continue to add to the scientific community’s understanding of xenotransplantation, from the initial transplant procedure to the post-transplant management of the xenograft,” the company said. “We keep Mrs. Looney and her family in our thoughts, and we wish her a speedy recovery.”

The findings suggest that trypophobia, a phenomenon often described as a fear of holes, may be more accurately understood as a disgust-based response aimed at avoiding disease. However, fear also plays a role, particularly in individuals most sensitive to these images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trypophobia is not officially recognized as a clinical phobia, but a substantial number of people report feeling disturbed when they see clusters of holes. These reactions can range from mild unease to intense physical symptoms, such as nausea, goosebumps, or racing heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychology-afraid-of-holes-evolution-may-hold-the-answer-to-trypophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proposed two evolutionary explanations&lt;/a&gt; for why these responses occur. One theory suggests that trypophobia originates from an ancient fear of dangerous animals, like venomous snakes or insects, which often have surface patterns similar to hole clusters. According to this account, fear should be the dominant reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second theory suggests that trypophobia is a product of the behavioral immune system—a set of psychological responses that help humans avoid sources of infection. This disease avoidance account predicts that disgust, rather than fear, should dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although both theories have some empirical support, the emotional profile of trypophobia remains unclear. Earlier studies have not always included direct comparisons between fear and disgust, and very few have assessed both emotions in response to trypophobic, fear-inducing, and disgust-inducing images. The researchers behind the new study, led by Gaëtan Thiebaut and Patrick Bonin at Université Bourgogne Europe, sought to fill this gap by measuring how strongly people react to different types of images across both emotional dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonin is a professor of cognitive psychology at Université Bourgogne Europe and a member of the LEAD-CNRS laboratory, where he conducts research on memory and the behavioral immune system. Thiebaut holds a PhD in cognitive psychology and specializes in research on memory and pathogen avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a personal level, we both find it difficult to look at clusters of holes, such as a lotus flower or a wasp’s nest, without feeling uncomfortable,” the researchers explained. “In fact, when Gaëtan started to work with trypophobic images, he realized that he was trypophobic. Also, trypophobia is related to one of our favorite research topics: the behavioral immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trypophobia is a fascinating area of research that affects a relatively large number of people (on average between 9% to 18% of trypophobic individuals per study), and has evolutionary explanations that can sometimes seem surprising to the uninitiated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 291 adult volunteers, most of whom were female university students. Participants completed an online survey in which they viewed 40 photographs divided into four categories: trypophobic images (e.g., lotus pods, wasp nests), frightening images (e.g., snakes, guns), disgusting images (e.g., mouldy food, dirty toilets), and neutral images (e.g., kitchen utensils). These photos were standardized for size and emotional characteristics, using validated norms where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each image, participants rated how much fear and disgust it elicited, as well as how difficult it was to look at the image, using a 5-point scale. The researchers used these ratings to compare emotional responses across image types and to identify participants who were particularly sensitive to trypophobic stimuli. Those with the highest discomfort ratings were analyzed separately to assess whether their emotional patterns differed from those of the broader sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the full sample, trypophobic images were rated as more disgusting than frightening. While these images were not rated as disgusting as the explicitly disgusting ones, they still triggered more disgust than fear. This was true even though trypophobic images were also seen as more frightening than neutral images, showing that both emotions are present to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the participants who reported the most difficulty viewing the trypophobic images—those in the top 10 percent of discomfort ratings—showed a different pattern. For these individuals, trypophobic images were rated as more disgusting than even the disgust-inducing images, and more frightening than the frightening ones. In other words, for the people most sensitive to clusters of holes, trypophobic images were uniquely disturbing across both emotional dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even among these highly sensitive participants, however, disgust remained the dominant emotion. This supports the idea that trypophobia is more closely linked to disease avoidance than to the fear of predators. These findings are consistent with previous work showing that people with high scores on the Trypophobia Questionnaire tend to report core and pathogen-related disgust more than moral or sexual disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trypophobic participants (in our study, this corresponds to participants with visual discomfort ratings when viewing trypophobia-inducing pictures above the 9th decile) feel more disgust than fear at the sight of images of clusters of holes,” Bonin and Thiebaut told PsyPost. “But above all, these stimuli are very specific for them, because they evoke even more fear than non-trypophobic fear-inducing pictures such as the images of spiders, snakes, or a person pointing a gun and more disgust than non-trypophobic disgust-inducing pictures, such as the images of surgery, dirty toilets, or moldy burgers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also help clarify why both fear and disgust can be part of the trypophobic experience. Disgust may serve to prevent contact with potential sources of infection—such as spoiled food or skin lesions—while fear may help initiate flight from a perceived threat. The fact that both emotions are activated could reflect how our minds respond to stimuli that might signal either kind of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, there are limitations to consider. The sample was predominantly female and made up largely of psychology students, which may affect how generalizable the findings are to the broader population. Prior research suggests that women may be more likely than men to report trypophobia, so future studies should include more diverse samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation concerns the images themselves. The researchers selected fear and disgust images from general categories, such as weapons or hygiene-related scenes. A more targeted comparison might involve disgusting images related to skin diseases, which may more closely resemble trypophobic patterns. This could help test whether specific forms of disgust are more relevant to trypophobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will continue this type of work with a larger number of trypophobic images to examine whether there are variations in the emotions felt (disgust, fear) according to the type of trypophobic stimuli (natural elements, artefacts),” Bonin and Thiebaut said. “We also want to further test the hypothesis that trypophobia is essentially due to activation of the behavioral immune system, and is therefore rooted in our evolutionary past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218251323236" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Is trypophobia more related to disgust than to fear? Assessing the disease avoidance and ancestral fear hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Gaëtan Thiebaut, Alain Méot, Pavol Prokop, and Patrick Bonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:07:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQaVZ2cm5iMnhwVkxUWG1IYnRSblZhOHBHdHZqdG82Nkp6VEVkYnh3VzFnSWdDd3gwRjVuMmkxN0xZTnlwV28tb1FTSFZGTGpXN19DVUZudzBkRGNJNkY4TGRhXzZvQ0ZLTmlZZGlkSUdXNWduaDFTcmpCQ0EyaEtOTDh0VGppMU1sSWE4NG4xdE5tUQ</guid></item><item><title>Malnutrition-Related Diabetes Officially Named ‘Type 5’ - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOVmFPRGduUm1wUVJUdmo0Ry1Nb0FOUnp3TjQ4cm9pa001T0xFeTlHQVNKZk95d000Yi1CUzJzTXptd21oSE00OGw1Y3EwVEZiQ0JVV1J0SllDa3huOUpiTnFDVTU4UnlPNnhkTk94QjF2VTE1cDFHWnBCTXNEc3gwYlQxWXN4a1lweFV6YlZVVUtJbkNqSzhsOVZBNFExVFY1dUJlWmlR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malnutrition-related diabetes, distinct from both type 1 and type 2, has now been officially recognized and named “type 5 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote to endorse the category took place on April 8, during the International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF’s) World Diabetes Congress, held in Bangkok, Thailand. In January 2025, a panel met in India to draft a consensus statement about the condition, due to be published soon, Meredith Hawkins, MD, professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Malnutrition-related diabetes has historically been vastly underdiagnosed and poorly understood…The IDF’s recognition of it as ‘type 5 diabetes’ is an important step toward raising awareness of a health problem that is so devastating to so many people,” Hawkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(According to the &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/47/Supplement_1/S20/153954/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, “type 3” diabetes indicates specific types due to other causes such as single genes, exocrine pancreatic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, or drug/chemical-induced diabetes. “Type 4” is gestational diabetes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673655925307"&gt;Malnutrition-related diabetes&lt;/a&gt; was first described in Jamaica in 1955. It is seen most commonly in young men in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who have a body mass index &amp;lt; 19. They are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, but they don’t develop ketonuria or ketosis despite high blood glucose levels and high insulin requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1985, the World Health Organization officially classified “malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus” as a distinct diabetes type, but then in 1999 dropped the category, citing a lack of evidence that malnutrition or protein deficiency causes diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins became aware of malnutrition-related diabetes in 2005 while teaching at global health meetings. In 2010, she founded Einstein’s Global Diabetes Institute to study it. In 2022, she and her colleagues published findings from &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/6/1428/146920/An-Atypical-Form-of-Diabetes-Among-Individuals"&gt;state-of-the-art metabolic testing&lt;/a&gt; in 73 Asian Indian men, including 20 with what is now called “type 5 diabetes” following exclusion of all other known forms of diabetes by immunogenetic analysis. Another 15 had type 1 diabetes, 13 had type 2 diabetes, 16 were lean without diabetes, and 9 were overweight without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the findings were lower total insulin secretion in the “type 5” group than in both the lean group without diabetes and the T2D group, significantly lower endogenous glucose production and significantly higher glucose uptake in the type 5 group than in the T2D group, and significantly lower visceral adipose tissue and hepatocellular lipids in the type 5 group than in the T2D group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings contradict the previous belief that malnutrition-associated diabetes was associated primarily with insulin resistance. “It turns out people with this form of diabetes have a profound defect in the capacity to secrete insulin, which wasn’t recognized before. This finding has revolutionized how we think about this condition and how we should treat it,” Hawkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt; it’s important to differentiate type 5 from type 1 diabetes because giving too much insulin can rapidly prove fatal. While there aren’t clear guidelines yet for treating type 5, some data suggest that very small amounts of insulin combined with oral agents may be the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, she added, “I suspect that their nutrition should include much higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates, plus attention to deficient micronutrients…but this needs to be carefully studied now that there is global will and an official mandate from [the International Diabetes Federation] to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins lectures on this topic often at universities in LMICs. “They frequently ask, ‘Why is it we see so much of it and yet never read about it in textbooks?’ Turns out those textbooks are written in the West, where it is not encountered. This will change soon…I’m excited that the tide is turning on a condition that is so prevalent among the world’s poor yet so neglected in Western literature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A working group has been tasked with developing formal diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 over the next 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkins had no disclosures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miriam E.
