      &lt;p&gt;Weight loss and diabetes jabs taken by more than a million people in the UK have been linked to a potential serious side effect, with some deaths, according to data from the UK medicines regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New figures from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) show the group of drugs that includes Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Ozempic may be associated with inflammation of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the MHRA, there have been 181 reported cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis linked to Mounjaro, with five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic have been linked with 113 reports of pancreatitis and one death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other, less widely used versions of so-called GLP-1 drugs have also been linked to cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that the drugs directly caused the deaths. And the evidence isn't strong enough for the MHRA to restrict access.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-site-video callfn" data-account-id="6058004172001" data-amp-iframe-embed="" data-asset-id="79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-asset-path="" data-asset-version="" data-autoplay="false" data-auth-config="" data-caption="Weight loss drugs compared" data-clip-type="" data-component-name="sdc-site-video" data-component-name-alias="ui-sitewide-video" data-competition="" data-copy-url-text="URL copied to clipboard" data-fn="sdc-site-video" data-id="id_79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-is-live-stream="false" data-lite="true" data-options="" data-originator-id="51" data-originator-handle="brightcove-news-gb" data-package-name="" data-provider="brightcove" data-player-id="yjBoKQ5XA" data-playsinline="" data-sensitive="false" data-sdc-id="6913960" data-sdc-video-id="79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-sport-category="" data-state="loading" data-token-state="none" data-video-ad-unit="" data-video-blacklisted-originator-ids="" data-video-id="ref:79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-video-type="" data-auto-pause-on-not-visible="true" tabindex="-1" data-closed-captions-position="middle-third" data-show-closed-captions="true" data-show-pip="true" data-show-live-stream-scrubber="true" data-autoload="false"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because pancreatitis also occurs in people who aren't taking the GLP-1 drugs, with about 560 cases for every one million people in the general population. Gallstones and alcohol are the biggest causes.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;But the MHRA and Genomics England are launching a new study to see whether some people have genes that put them at higher risk of developing pancreatitis if they take GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People reported through the MHRA's 'yellow card' alert system to have pancreatitis while using the jabs will be asked to provide a saliva sample and their genes tested.&lt;/p&gt;        
&lt;p&gt;Professor Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: "GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines, there can be a risk of serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This next step in our partnership with the MHRA will generate data and evidence for safer and more effective treatment through more personalised approaches to prescription."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-article-image"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main symptoms of pancreatitis are severe pain in the centre of the tummy area, fever and nausea. Acute cases are treated in hospital with fluids and oxygen, and generally make a recovery within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can be complications, and around 5% of acute cases are fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all medicines, there is a balance of risk and benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with type 2 &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/diabetes-6941" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/obesity-7171" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are clear benefits to using the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lower blood sugar levels, lead to rapid weight loss and reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/weight-loss-jab-warning-from-health-watchdog-over-unborn-babies-13379102" target="_blank"&gt;Weight loss jab warning from watchdog over unborn babies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/gps-can-prescribe-weight-loss-jabs-on-the-nhs-from-today-but-strict-eligibility-criteria-in-place-13387265" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPs can prescribe weight loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/from-ozempic-to-mounjaro-the-diabetes-drugs-repurposed-as-weight-loss-wonders-12823419" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic to Wegovy - what are the weight loss injections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     
&lt;p&gt;But for people who are a bit overweight and have sourced the jabs privately to lose a few pounds ahead of their summer holiday, the health benefits are far less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a wake-up call for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are powerful medications with effects not just on appetite, but on lots of body organs, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And pancreatitis is just one of many possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly, the UK manufacturer of Mounjaro, has said patient safety is its "top priority".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug's patient information leaflet "warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people)," the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily "also advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Novo Nordisk UK, which manufactures Wegovy and Ozempic, said in a statement: "Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like all medications, side effects can occur and vary from patient to patient. The known risks and benefits of GLP1 medicines are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We recommend that patients take these medications only for their approved indications and under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional, who can also advise on potential side effects."&lt;/p&gt;

We had blocked each other on social media, but at least with Instagram, I could prove to him that I had moved on and was happy, that is, if he was so inclined to look at my account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thinking was that although I was dying inside, I would post photos of just how wonderful my life was without him. I had run off to Paris to recover from the heartbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/rather-travel-world-ever-have-kids"&gt;and traveled around Europe for a bit,&lt;/a&gt; all the while posting photos of me with a smile on my face as I indulged in pizza in Italy, sangria in Barcelona, and spring in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was how I was going to prove to not just him, but to myself, that &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-you-cant-get-over-him-do-things-immediately"&gt;I was capable of a life that didn’t include him&lt;/a&gt;. After a while, I finally convinced myself that I was. I don’t know if he ever snooped around my Instagram, but I want to believe he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram, as well as other forms of social media, have become a place where people either show only the great parts of their lives or complain and moan about how awful everything is &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/personality-clues-person-insecure-attention-seeker"&gt;in the hopes of getting attention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it seems like that latter group would be the most annoying, in reality, it's all those "happy" people who irk us. A&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/09/facebook-posts-reflect-relationship-insecurity.html" rel="nofollow"&gt; 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; shows that those happy people aren't all that happy after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;According to research, most happy couples are lying about how happy they really are on social media.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/big-lie-most-happy-looking-couples-tell-social-media.png" alt="man telling lies on social media" title="the big lie most happy-looking couples tell on social media" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Chinnapong / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/painfully-honest-reasons-social-media-causes-relationship-problems"&gt;7 Painfully Honest Reasons Why Social Media Causes Relationship Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The study found that the more insecure the couple was in their relationship, the more they pretended to be happy on social media.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214549944?icid=int.sj-full-text.similar-articles.8" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that when &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habits-signal-lack-security-relationship"&gt;people are dealing with relationship insecurity&lt;/a&gt;, they're more likely to post "more relationship-relevant" statuses and photos on social media. In addition, people who are just generally anxious also tend to do the same. It's the whole "smile, though your heart is aching" concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to prove that things are better than they are makes total sense. I've always wondered why people take to TikTok to air their dirty laundry and complain about how their &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-you-think-hes-cheating-what-immediately-to-do"&gt;boyfriend just cheated on them&lt;/a&gt;, and this has happened more than a few times, and they’ve just suffered a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that in such situations, people want to share their grief, but I’m also of the belief that social media is not the platform for such things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/entertainment/what-anniversary-posts-social-media-reveal-about-couples-relationship"&gt;What A Couple's Anniversary Post On Social Media Reveals About Their Relationship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But painting your life on social media as one big, rosy highlight reel is a bit deluded.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or is it? Perhaps it's hopeful to look at the sunny side of life, even in your darkest moments. Just like it was hopeful of me posting photos of myself on a yacht in the Hamptons &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/how-to-get-over-a-breakup"&gt;after my break-up&lt;/a&gt;, even if the truth was that I was crying into my glass of champagne when the camera wasn’t on me.

			&lt;p&gt;Research suggests a surprising link between blood type and stroke risk, with people carrying one specific group A blood type facing a higher likelihood of stroke before age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding, published in 2022, deepens our understanding of how our unique biological makeup can impact our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard of the A, B, AB, and O groups, which refer to the various chemical markers, known as antigens, found on the surface of our red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type is partly determined by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.

All participants were between the ages of 18 and 59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed a clear relationship between the gene responsible for the A1 blood subgroup, and early-onset stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genome-wide search revealed two locations strongly associated with an earlier risk of stroke. One coincided with the spot where genes for blood type sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second analysis of specific types of blood-type gene then found people whose genome coded for a variation of the A group had a 16 percent higher chance of a stroke before the age 60, compared with a population of other blood types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a gene for group O1, the risk was lower by 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, however, that the additional risk of stroke in people with type A blood is small, so there is no need for extra vigilance or screening in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still don't know why blood type A would confer a higher risk," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author and vascular neurologist Steven Kittner from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the blood vessels as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study findings may seem alarming – that blood type could change early stroke risk – let's put these results into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year in the US just under 800,000 individuals experience a stroke. Most of these events – around &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535078/"&gt;three out of every four&lt;/a&gt; – occur in people 65 years and older, with risks doubling every decade after the age of 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the people included in the study lived in North America, Europe, Japan, Pakistan, and Australia, with people of non-European ancestry only making up 35 percent of participants. Future studies with a more diverse sample could help clarify the significance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We clearly need more follow-up studies to clarify the mechanisms of increased stroke risk," Kittner &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding of the study came from comparing people who had a stroke before the age of 60 to those that had a stroke after the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this, the researchers used a dataset of about 9,300 people over the age of 60 who had a stroke, and some 25,000 controls over the age of 60 who didn't have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the increased risk of stroke in the type A blood group became insignificant in the late-onset stroke group, suggesting that strokes that happen early in life may have a different mechanism compared to those that occur later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strokes in younger people are less likely to be caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries (a process called atherosclerosis) and more likely to be caused by factors to do with clot formation, the authors &lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/99/16/e1738"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people with type B blood were around 11 percent more likely to have a stroke compared to non-stroke controls regardless of their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.784"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the part of the genome that codes for blood type, called the 'ABO locus', is associated with coronary artery calcification, which restricts blood flow, and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic sequence for A and B blood types have also been associated with a slightly higher risk of blood clots in veins, called venous thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2022/08/31/WNL.0000000000201006"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A century ago, one of the biggest &lt;a href="https://scispace.com/pdf/the-hazards-of-immunization-3ps0h5suhg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines involved bacterial contamination. In 1916, four young children died in South Carolina after receiving typhoid vaccine that had been contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Twelve years later, 12 children in Queensland, Australia, died from tainted immunizations against diphtheria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmccklfmq00053b6mvnf3amap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the 1930s, vaccine makers began using a preservative called thimerosal to stave off microbial growth in their products. For the next six decades, it didn’t receive much notice; ill effects appeared limited to minor local injection-site reactions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0005356mh4k6egvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That changed in 1999, when US health officials asked pharmaceutical companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines. There was no evidence that it caused harm in the quantities used, but thimerosal contains a form of mercury, and questions had emerged about whether it could cause neurotoxicity when given in childhood vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0006356mvc61vd0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine makers have removed it from all but a few shots, such as multidose vials of flu vaccine. In the meantime, subsequent studies have confirmed no link between thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental issues, including autism, and autism rates have continued to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0007356m4p1ym41u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So public health experts were puzzled when the preservative appeared on the agenda for this week’s meeting of outside vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0008356mc0bv7vyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I actually don’t know any pediatric practices that even use that multidose influenza vaccine,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Colorado and former liaison to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0009356m1wnianqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group is meeting on Wednesday and Thursday for the first time since US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed &lt;/a&gt;the committee’s previous 17 members, claiming they had conflicts of interest, and days later installed eight new advisers. Public health experts and lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/kennedy-vaccine-panel-pressure-warren-cassidy"&gt;called into question&lt;/a&gt; the credentials and backgrounds of some of the new panelists, and just before the meeting began, one member withdrew during the financial holdings review, an HHS spokesman said, bringing the panel down to seven.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pkt7300003b6m63k02sy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A presentation “regarding thimerosal in vaccines” is scheduled for Thursday morning, followed by “proposed recommendations” specifically about thimerosal in flu vaccines, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-23.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; posted Monday. The meeting is scheduled to conclude with a vote on the latter, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; that could lead to official CDC policy if adopted by agency leadership – or, without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/health/cdc-vaccine-advisers-meeting-cassidy"&gt;confirmed director&lt;/a&gt; in place, by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000a356mp0k2ib24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The last-minute addition of thimerosal to the agenda was a red flag for vaccine experts, who consider the science settled and fear that Kennedy – who &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vaccine group called Children’s Health Defense – is seeking to sow doubt about vaccine safety. Another former Children’s Health Defense leader, Lyn Redwood, is slated to make a presentation on the topic at the meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000b356mluk6aumy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how thimerosal became such a hot-button issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000d356m5n8eotlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1997, Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat concerned about mercury pollution in his community’s lakes and rivers, attached an amendment to a US Food and Drug Administration reauthorization bill that would require the agency to catalogue intentionally introduced mercury compounds in drugs and food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000e356mwh4d1pk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That led to a possibly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;startling discovery: “As people looked in vaccines, there was the potential that, by six months of age, infants could have received more thimerosal than was listed in several sources of what was considered safe levels of mercury,” said Dr. Walter Orenstein, who was director of the National Immunization Program at the CDC at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000f356mnflu3t73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But those limits were set for methylmercury, the kind found in some fish, which is known to be toxic. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a different compound that’s “intrinsically less stable, and more readily metabolized, than methylmercury,” said Dr. Matthew Rand, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine at the University of Rochester who studies mercury toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000g356mcsrnbx70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means it’s cleared from the body more quickly than methylmercury, according to the CDC, “and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.” The FDA notes that there were no existing guidelines for ethylmercury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000h356myvbnzuhn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, the finding led to a number of emergency meetings among federal health officials and outside groups to determine what should be done, Orenstein recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000i356mk8khri1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While there was no evidence of harm from thimerosal, the general feeling was, ‘let’s get rid of it, because we don’t need it,’ ” he said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Moving to single-dose containers alleviated the need for a preservative, although it came at a higher expense for manufacturers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000j356mm8qqcuv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1999, the FDA sent a letter to manufacturers of US vaccines requesting their plans to remove thimerosal, and by 2001, the compound had been removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children under 6 in the US, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000k356mzecddtkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The message from public health agencies, Orenstein said, was “we’re going to make safe vaccines even safer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000m356muyw1p1x6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the die was cast. Vaccines had already been tied to autism in 1998 by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who published a since-&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/02/lancet.retraction.autism/index.html"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; paper that claimed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was linked to autism, although not because of thimerosal – the MMR vaccine never contained the preservative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000n356m5v8g4l3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, parents of children with autism were seeking answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9q1col00043b6m3f0u81e6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of those parents was Redwood, who said that in 1999, she tallied up her son’s mercury exposure and found “at two months of age, he had received 125 times his allowable exposure to mercury based on EPA’s guidelines in his weight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000o356mwq2ztmtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That was a real answer for me,” Redwood said in a &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/events/the-autism-cover-up-simpsonwood-scandal-25-years-of-fraud-and-corruption/thimerosal-simpsonwood-safeminds-lyn-redwood/" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted by Children’s Health Defense this month, “because my son at this time was almost 5 years old, and he had regressed developmentally after his first year of life and was diagnosed with autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000p356m02wkaj9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Redwood, a nurse practioner, decided to become an advocate, speaking at events and publishing papers about thimerosal and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000r356mlgvdnqt6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uproar over a potential link between thimerosal and autism came as a surprise to Orenstein and colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000s356mcrejhtge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mercury itself had never been implicated as a major cause of autism,” Orenstein said. “But this was a major, major concern.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000t356mraqanzmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It led to a number of studies of the issue, including a 2004 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20669467/" target="_blank"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; by the Institute of Medicine (now &lt;a href="https://nam.edu/about-the-nam/" target="_blank"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; as the National Academy of Medicine) that concluded “the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.” It made the same conclusion for MMR vaccines and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000u356muqvidsq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2010 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20837594/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC also found no link. And “even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase,” the agency noted, “which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000v356mcn7m30fv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, those who continued to push the disproven autism connection included Kennedy, who published a book in 2014 called “Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak.” Its subtitle calls for the “immediate removal of mercury – a known neurotoxin – from vaccines.” It rejects the findings of the 2004 Institute of Medicine report and warns that millions of children in the US and around the world “appear to be at risk of injury from the thimerosal in vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000w356mu5igi0sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thimerosal is still present in “a small percentage of flu vaccines, confined to multidose vials,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/viewpoint-cdcs-upcoming-vaccine-advisory-meeting-set-sow-distrust" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group focused on countering vaccine misinformation that was started at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, or CIDRAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000x356ma38f6j1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group suspects that thimerosal is included on ACIP’s agenda this week – with a presentation by Redwood and a vote by the committee – “to put greater focus on and generate more public discussion about vaccine risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000y356mjext9xul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS didn’t return a request for comment about Redwood’s involvement in this week’s meeting, and Redwood declined to comment. Her presentation &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/05-influenza-redwood-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, however, were posted ahead of the meeting and continued to claim thimerosal presents safety risks. One slide initially included in the presentation cited a study in animals that appeared not to exist; its apparent lead author &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/cdc-vaccine-adviser-thimerosal-presentation"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;CNN he’d published a study with a similar title, but in a different journal, in different animals, and with dramatically different findings — ones that didn’t appear to show a link between autism and thimerosal. The slide presentation was subsequently updated to remove that slide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcbwg3jk0000356m7le45aph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC staff also posted its own &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/Thimerosal-Containing-Vaccines-Summary-of-Evidence-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;of the data, citing nearly two dozen studies showing “the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcc30y8i00003b6my84mzqat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During her Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Dr. Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CDC, said, “I have not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0011356ms66k0ofe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision to remove thimerosal from most vaccines, despite no evidence of harm, had other consequences. At the same time the FDA made its request to vaccine makers, US health authorities advised that babies born to mothers known to be negative for hepatitis B not receive a shot for that virus at birth, but at two months to 6 months of age, as thimerosal was phased out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0012356mohamwqlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But about 10% of hospitals “suspended use of the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, regardless of their level of risk,” wrote Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s outside advisory committee on vaccines, in a 2007 perspective &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078187" target="_blank"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. “One three-month-old child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of overwhelming infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0013356myj5esyxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Orenstein looks back on the decision to remove thimerosal as a hard one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0014356mbqkl0x57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fear would be keeping it in there, doing a study over two or three years and then it showed harm, and lo and behold, for three years, we used this vaccine and this component was harmful,” he said. “Since we didn’t know what the results would be of any of the studies at the time, we thought it better to just get it out of there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0015356mu36p9zj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The autism issue,” he added, “didn’t play any role in the initial decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0016356m074ywi5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina hospitals are on the lookout for patients
with symptoms of measles after the first reported case in the state this week. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state health department confirmed on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-first-measles-case-june-2025/"&gt;a
child in the Greensboro area tested positive for measles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state reported the child had visited several public spaces
since becoming infected and is encouraging others who were in the area to
monitor for symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Triangle-area hospitals tell WRAL they are on alert for any
patient who may be the next suspected measles case.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working hard for months to prepare for an
outbreak of measles or multiple outbreaks at once,” said Dr. David Wohl with
UNC Health. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wohl, an infectious disease specialist, told WRAL the confirmed
case didn’t come as a surprise. He added it is likely the state will see even
more cases because of how contagious the virus is.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This was inevitable. We knew that eventually we would get a
case here as well,” Wohl said. “Measles is an incredibly infectious virus. It
can linger in the air; it can linger on surfaces. People born before 1957, we
basically assume you are immune because it was so widespread and it is so
catchy, that it’s almost impossible that you weren’t exposed before the
vaccines became available.”&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In 2000, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; declared measles had been eliminated from the U.S.,
meaning the only new cases were being reported from individuals traveling from
other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Smith, Duke Health Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious
Diseases, shared the concern with new outbreaks 25 years later lies with fewer
children being fully vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith explained vaccine misinformation which increased during
the pandemic, including unfounded claims the MMR vaccine was tied to cases of autism,
may be contributing to lower vaccination rates among kids in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Until this year where we’ve had a lot of measles, as a
parent you could say ‘Well measles is not really common in the United States so
I’m not going to worry about it,” Smith said. “That story is not true. The MMR
vaccine does not cause autism. Don’t take it from me as a doctor – I’m a dad
and both my kids are vaccinated. This is a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith advised parents that not vaccinating their children may
increase their child’s risk of getting severely ill. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Measles can make you very sick. Best case scenario, you
feel awful and it’s like the worst cold of your life,” Smith warned. “There
really is no treatment for this, despite what you may be hearing in the media
these days. The vaccine really is the most important thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;More than 1,220 measles cases and three deaths have been
reported across the United States this year, according to the CDC. The agency
reports 95% of cases occurred in individuals who were unvaccinated or whose
vaccination status was not known. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wohl and Smith agree communication between hospital staff,
clinicians, urgent cares, pediatric offices and health departments will be
crucial to identifying, and slowing potential outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Not everybody who has measles presents as a rash, often
times they present with a really high fever or a sore throat or red eyes,” Wohl
explained. “We have to sensitize people who might be the first folks who see
some of these cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith added families with upcoming travel plans and have not
been vaccinated should be on high alert. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We know now there is a case in our state,” Smith
said. “There’s no doubt if you’re traveling through any airport you’re going to
come in contact with somebody who may have been exposed to measles, the best
thing you can do is get vaccinated.”





&lt;/p&gt;

Health officials said that means the risk to the public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were in the exposure areas at the listed times, public health said you should first check your MMR vaccination records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop an illness with a fever or unexplained rash, call a healthcare provider immediately. Officials said to call before going to a clinic or hospital to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not up to date on vaccinations and were at any of the locations at the times listed, public health said &lt;strong&gt;you would become sick between June 21 and July 13.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are immunocompromised may take longer than that date range to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/canadian-confirmed-measles-case-sea-tac-airport-vaccination-status-king-county-seattle-public-health-april-6-7-s-concourse-general-public-tukwila-airport-comfort-suites" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/canadian-confirmed-measles-case-sea-tac-airport-vaccination-status-king-county-seattle-public-health-april-6-7-s-concourse-general-public-tukwila-airport-comfort-suites" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles exposure warning issued for Sea-Tac airport and Tukwila hotel after traveler visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease, causing fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person contracts measles, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles are contagious four days before the rash starts through four days after the rash appears. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about seven to 10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10-14 days (with a range of seven to 21 days.) People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and in rare cases, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people can experience complications from measles, but those at highest risk include infants and children under five years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination offers safe, effective measles protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, Providence Swedish strongly recommends that everyone receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and providing long-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 21:55:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxPeGVYT2lteDdYUHh5TlNjaGNzeWZmc25lZVRiVjRtdEJpUEZNNzd1dE9pcDhXUUlxNWhxTjVMZHpwYUlNMWFrclY2aXdydXZLSmROUHZwNDNuREotd1B3d21vZU5HNTFFSnMyVm9oZ2szRW5uLWg5SFJBRmN6N28ycTM2VkdyUVREaFNJeHUycUNMd0VyZ1pvTEZRMXYwd213VGs1d25UeFR4YWVIeXplemo5LXgwRFU4SHlnaTdUNlFMWlJvclJUalVydXB4a3VFR1hJN1B3Vy1LM3N4S1I5WExTNUN6dFdIcDZZ</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究表明，改变这项日常任务的一件事可以将心脏病风险降低一半- Earth.com | Changing one thing about this everyday task cuts heart disease risk in half, says a new study - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOSXMxb2RyRXM3UmRablJqbldDcjNjRWstTzU1Q3pEOC1sc3haNV9fNlBjTmhXS0NLX0xwVWhkVkFuQVJpVE1DY3ZSYTJLZVJEVHMzcE1qQTlWVDRXcnBubkJBRmJSaFNPTjhyTnNRc3Ezc0htbTJMbGpVRDFlLXZId01yQVRuSkVZeHF2RmlucnI4MXoyMWdraWJzSW43eUNINVBYLWFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease kills more Americans than any other condition, claiming about 941,652 lives in 2022. That’s nearly one out of every five deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis says you can cut that danger in half simply by quickening everyday chores, and it does not require a gym membership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; led the project that quietly tracked more than 24,000 self‑described non‑exercisers with wrist‑worn motion sensors for a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-movement-and-heart-disease"&gt;Everyday movement and heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think of exercise as planned workouts, yet the trackers revealed that tiny bursts of motion during routine tasks, from carrying groceries to scrubbing a tub, still raise the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-or-low-fat-food-quality-is-more-important-for-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each little surge counts toward the 150 minutes of moderate activity that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; recommends every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this incidental physical activity (IPA), a catch‑all for movement that happens naturally while living, working, or commuting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPA sidesteps the cost, travel, and time barriers that keep roughly three in five U.S. adults from meeting exercise guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, staying seated for long stretches lets blood sugar and blood pressure creep upward, feeding &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease (CVD)&lt;/a&gt;. Over time those changes stiffen arteries and invite clots that trigger heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous large‑scale work shows that women who combine at least three different household or leisure activities cut CVD risk by forty percent compared with women who stick to only one type of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-and-movement"&gt;Heart disease and movement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sydney team mined data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a massive project linking health records with lifestyle tracking. Participants averaged 62 years old and reported no structured workouts, yet their trackers captured every ten‑second burst of motion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An artificial‑intelligence model sorted each snippet into light, moderate, or vigorous effort. The scientists then waited almost eight years to see who suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/men-and-women-have-different-heart-rhythms-and-now-we-know-why/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; event or died. Hospital records confirmed 908 major cardiac events and 223 cardiovascular deaths in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crunching the numbers showed an L‑shaped curve: risk plummeted quickly with the first bits of effort, then leveled off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily totals of just 24 minutes at a moderate clip or 4 to 5 minutes at a vigorous clip predicted roughly fifty percent fewer heart attacks or strokes compared with people who mostly ambled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/gibalam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Gibala&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McMaster University&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved, called the work “a solid piece of evidence that even brief bursts matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-fast-is-fast-enough"&gt;How fast is fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity means you can talk but not sing, like pushing a vacuum cleaner briskly or climbing stairs with purpose. Vigorous intensity steals your breath so that only a few words fit between gasps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, hurrying up two flights of stairs, hauling laundry in double‑time, or sprint‑walking to the mailbox three or four times a day fills that five‑minute vigorous quota. Those minutes do not need to be consecutive; the study counted them whenever they appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamatakis’ group calculated health “exchange rates.” One vigorous minute matched about three moderate minutes or nearly forty‑five light minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-is-worse-for-the-heart-than-cocaine/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; protection. That conversion helps people who dislike huffing and puffing find an alternative pace and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adding-some-pep-to-your-step"&gt;Adding some pep to your step&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn a slow sweep into a speed sweep by widening your stance and pushing the broom in long strokes. This bumps effort into the moderate zone without special gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carry grocery bags one at a time up the driveway and time yourself. A shorter trip each night builds a habit of pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap the elevator for the stairs on the way to your apartment or office. The extra sixty seconds of climbing can replace a two‑minute jog later. Gardening can count too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racing the timer while pulling weeds or raking leaves lifts heart rate beyond the comfortable chatting zone. Small tweaks spread through the day avoid sweating through clothes, a leading barrier cited in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-heart-disease-prevention"&gt;Future of heart disease prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPA does not replace structured workouts, which improve muscle strength, balance, and mental health in ways chores cannot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for millions who struggle to meet formal goals, brisk chores close part of the gap and still leave room for weekend hikes or bike rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-remains-leading-cause-of-death-as-key-health-risk-factors-continue-to-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that eighty percent of cardiac events are preventable through lifestyle choices like diet, activity, and smoking cessation. Quick chores could be the lowest‑cost intervention of them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the findings dovetail with long‑standing advice to break up sitting with movement. Every hour of desk work should end with a brief spell of standing or walking, and adding intensity multiplies the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biobank cohort was mostly White and middle‑aged, so future studies need to follow diverse younger groups to confirm the effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also hope to test whether digital nudges, such as phone alerts, can prompt timely bursts of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, public‑health campaigns may soon update guidelines to highlight IPA alongside formal exercise, making the message clearer for busy parents and older adults with mobility concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 21:12:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOSXMxb2RyRXM3UmRablJqbldDcjNjRWstTzU1Q3pEOC1sc3haNV9fNlBjTmhXS0NLX0xwVWhkVkFuQVJpVE1DY3ZSYTJLZVJEVHMzcE1qQTlWVDRXcnBubkJBRmJSaFNPTjhyTnNRc3Ezc0htbTJMbGpVRDFlLXZId01yQVRuSkVZeHF2RmlucnI4MXoyMWdraWJzSW43eUNINVBYLWFn</guid></item><item><title>未接种疫苗的学生今年秋天不欢迎回到牛顿-波士顿环球报 | Unvaccinated students not welcome back in Newton this fall - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQWjZhbGxPZFlnM1ZLTlkzOHYzR2E2WHE3UnZkalVDQmxWUUFuYVh5N2N4UnBsOXgxVldWMXEwMXJQTl9HT0htdEYtZWtLeUNHdmYwMWRkT1NqY2dkdXN1ZnlNMFhPVFpDZ3VwbXZLaUxHajNRMUxHVi1PVzBTNnJYRk42TFdfa00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of those students, at least 42 were not fully vaccinated against measles, according to the district. The lack of immunization sparked concern with city officials, especially due to recent outbreaks of the disease in other parts of the country,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; like Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;700 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/06/nation/second-child-dies-measles-texas/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;two children have died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nolin and Newton Health and Human Services did not immediately return requests for comment about the stricter policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To comply with the state requirements, Newton Health and Human Services and school nurses will provide vaccines for students, the district said. There are two exemptions for immunizations: religious exemptions and doctor-approved exemptions for immunocompromised students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve got to follow state law, that’s our responsibility,” said School Committee Chair Chris Brezski, who has two middle schoolers in the system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts recently reported one case of measles from a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/14/metro/contagious-measles-visits-boston/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Boston tourist&lt;/a&gt;. Measles is one of the most highly contagious diseases, able to stay in the air for two hours. Newton’s quarantine period for unvaccinated students that come into contact with the disease is 21 days. The district is also not required to make up any missed education during that time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the herd immunity threshold for measles is between 92 percent and 94 percent immunization rate.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Massachusetts is currently &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/Vaccine/index.html?_gl=1*41phfd*_ga*MTAwOTE0OTEyMC4xNzUwODYxODg0*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTA4NjE4ODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NjE4ODQkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*ODgyOTMzODk5LjE3NTA4NjE4ODQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTA4NjE4ODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NjE4ODQkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;above average&lt;/a&gt;, at nearly 95 percent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Newton mother Brenda Anders Pring, 53, is a representative of the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Although immunization is widespread in the state, it’s important to keep an eye out for any potential risks to students, said Anders Pring, whose children are in middle and high school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The measles vaccine works really well if most people are vaccinated,” Pring said. “We’re at a place where we had almost eliminated measles and we hadn’t had a death in over 25 years in the country&lt;b&gt;."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other parents and teachers agreed with the district’s efforts to comply with state requirements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Denise Cremlin, a Spanish high school teacher at Newton North, said she was glad the school is taking action to protect students who might be undergoing chemotherapy treatments or have medical conditions that prevent them from getting vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s not just about me being vaccinated, it’s about how do I keep the other people in my community safe, who might be at more risk than I am,” Cremlin said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jonathan Brenner, 59, a pediatrician and parent of a fourth grader and, said he was surprised it took so long for the district to notify families about the unvaccinated students, and didn’t know exemptions during the pandemic period that allowed students to matriculate without all vaccine requirements hadn’t been updated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When you have a pocket of unimmunized children, these infectious diseases can spread,” Brenner said. “So I’m fully in support of the reinstatement of these vaccine requirements, and I’m also fully in support of the district’s position that they will not allow students back at school in the fall unless they admit the vaccine requirements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jessica Weed, 45, has a second grade student in the system. Weed is a stay-at-home mom who wasn’t aware of any chicken pox outbreaks, but agreed with the vaccine reinforcement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Especially for measles, I guess COVID or flu is more of a choice, but measles for sure,” Weed said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Immunization rates have plateaued, and year after year, we are reaching the same proportion of children without extending their reach to those left behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U7HZYX7CABAH3BBCF6RWOM5PBQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Unless we intensify efforts to reach more children through equitable routine immunization programmes, increase domestic investment, and strengthen vaccine confidence and demand, we risk undoing years of hard-won progress — leading to a future where more children suffer from preventable illnesses and premature death,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MJO4XUYCFND5DLKJLX3PLGRG44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An increase in vaccine hesitancy, as well as misinformation — which the WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019" target="_blank"&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; as a leading threat to global public health even before the pandemic — have impacted immunization, the study noted. Conflict is another factor. The outbreak of civil war in Sudan in 2023 led to one key coverage measurement — the number of children receiving the first dose of the DTP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis — falling from almost 90 percent to about half of that, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJ3JMTH5QRBQ7JC4R7W7RWWB2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Planned budget cuts to vaccines “are likely to disproportionately affect low-income and middle income countries,” the study said, but richer countries are also likely to be affected by higher costs caused by increasing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EAW4OI45IJFUVG7N3Z56MDN5DM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study’s findings echo a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2025-increases-in-vaccine-preventable-disease-outbreaks-threaten-years-of-progress--warn-who--unicef--gavi" target="_blank"&gt;warning this spring&lt;/a&gt; from the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who noted outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases were increasing around the world, “putting lives at risk and exposing countries to increased costs in treating diseases and responding to outbreaks.” He urged countries with limited resources to “invest in the highest-impact interventions — and that includes vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MEZQPBZHCZBPNMN4GTUSXQUVHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study, which was funded by the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was published in the Lancet medical journal.

Known scientifically as Toxoplasma gondii, this tiny invader silently alters &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-study-restores-brain-function-for-alzheimers-patients/"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; without obvious symptoms. Beneath this stealth lies a complex interaction with brain cells, highlighting new health risks previously underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one-third of Americans carry Toxoplasma gondii, often unaware they harbor the parasite. Usually contracted from undercooked meat or contact with cat feces, the infection rarely causes obvious illness in healthy people. However, this parasite can form long-lasting cysts inside brain cells, specifically neurons, quietly disrupting essential brain communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="neurons_and_astrocytes_a_vital_partnership"&gt;Neurons and Astrocytes: A Vital Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons carry vital information through electrical signals, enabling movements, thoughts, and feelings. These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/weight-loss-connected-to-nerve-cells-in-the-brain-study-finds/"&gt;nerve cells&lt;/a&gt; depend heavily on support from astrocytes, the most abundant type of supportive brain cells. Astrocytes nourish neurons, maintain brain chemistry, and regulate critical neurotransmitters like glutamate, preventing harmful build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Primary cortical neurons infected with Toxoplasma.

Wilson, uncovers precisely how Toxoplasma gondii infection disrupts this crucial partnership. Wilson's group, reporting in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLoS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;, showed the parasite specifically affects neuron-astrocyte communication by altering extracellular vesicles (EVs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles are tiny sacs released by cells, carrying proteins, genetic materials, and chemical signals. Cells use these vesicles to communicate vital messages over short distances. Normally, neurons produce ample EVs that astrocytes receive, regulating neurotransmitters like glutamate. But the researchers discovered infected neurons drastically reduce EV production and alter their contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="altered_messages_parasite_influenced_vesicles"&gt;Altered Messages: Parasite-Influenced Vesicles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team employed sophisticated laboratory techniques, including nanoparticle tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-measure-the-quantum-state-of-electrons-for-the-first-time/"&gt;electron microscopy&lt;/a&gt;, and genetic sequencing, to analyze vesicles from infected neurons. They found infected neuron vesicles contained unusual proteins specific to Toxoplasma gondii, like GRA7 and MAG1, proteins not normally found in human or mouse cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment," said Wilson. "Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the altered vesicles changed astrocyte behavior significantly. Upon receiving these modified EVs, astrocytes increased inflammation-related &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-helps-scientists-identify-key-genes-in-the-development-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;gene activity&lt;/a&gt; and sharply reduced production of GLT-1, the key glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_dangerous_neurochemical_shift"&gt;A Dangerous Neurochemical Shift&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Astrocytes typically remove excess glutamate, protecting neurons from overstimulation, which can cause seizures or nerve damage. But when GLT-1 levels fall, excess glutamate accumulates, potentially causing harmful excitability in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of EVs isolated from uninfected and infected neurons.

Wilson’s findings suggest chronic, unnoticed parasite infections may similarly disturb the brain's neurochemical balance, posing hidden health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/california-launches-two-free-digital-behavioral-health-platforms-for-children-and-families/"&gt;behavioral conditions&lt;/a&gt; than we previously thought," Wilson stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="possible_early_detection_through_vesicles"&gt;Possible Early Detection through Vesicles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, testing for Toxoplasma gondii infection involves detecting antibodies. This method can’t confirm if the parasite still resides actively in brain cells. However, Wilson's discovery opens the door to using EVs as biomarkers, easily isolatable from blood, offering clearer insights into brain infection status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Toxoplasma infection leads to changes in EV protein content.

This advancement could significantly improve how doctors detect and manage chronic brain infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Riverside team now plans to examine &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-single-drop-of-blood-provides-comprehensive-health-insights-within-minutes/"&gt;human blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from blood banks for signs of parasite-influenced EVs. Additionally, they aim to understand how glial cells recognize parasite proteins, insights that might eventually lead to therapies or even vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_and_protecting_the_brain"&gt;Understanding and Protecting the Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While infection with Toxoplasma gondii rarely leads to severe illness in healthy adults, understanding its subtle impacts is essential. This parasite primarily poses risks during pregnancy, as a new infection can cause birth defects.

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a really simple, easy way to help folks meet their protein needs,” registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.abbeyskitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.abbeyskitchen.com/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;Abbey Sharp&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;. She says most Americans aren’t deficient in protein, but “there are so many benefits to getting 25% to 30% of your calories from protein.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include feeling full and satisfied after meals, building muscle mass (which is especially important as you age), supporting weight loss, and your hair, skin, and nail health. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as protein powder becomes a staple in more people’s diets, there is growing chatter that it’s causing stomach issues, as social media users blame the supplement for their &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiesappp/video/7488889096719322399?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiesappp/video/7488889096719322399?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reinafitpro/video/7477270360355015982?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@reinafitpro/video/7477270360355015982?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what experts think.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How protein powder ingredients affect your gut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons that protein powder could irritate the stomach, according to registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at NYU, &lt;a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ethan-k-balk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ethan-k-balk" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;Ethan Balk&lt;/a&gt;. Whey protein in particular could be a likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be because of lactose intolerance,” Balk tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;. Whey protein powder comes from dairy, and some may experience bloating and gas because their body has trouble digesting the lactose, Balk says. While &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/sharp/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/sharp/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; says a possible solution is switching from whey protein concentrate to whey protein isolate, she cautions that isolate, which contains casein, could still cause bloating and nausea for some. In that case, you may want to try swapping whey protein for a plant-based protein to see if that helps, Balk says. If you’re still having issues, you could forgo protein powder or try supplementing with a probiotic, he adds.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potentially irritating ingredients include fermentable fibers like inulin and carrageenan, gums and thickeners like xanthan gum, and sugar alcohols that can produce gas as a byproduct and trigger stomach discomfort, Sharp says. You could try looking for protein powders without those ingredients and with sweeteners like monk fruit extract instead of sugar alcohols, which Sharp says is easier on the stomach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t overlook fiber&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An important thing to remember, Sharp says, is to not to&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/too-much-protein-not-enough-fiber/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/too-much-protein-not-enough-fiber/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt; not overdo it&lt;/a&gt; on protein powder to the point it displaces other vital nutrient-packed foods in your diet, which could be another cause of stomach issues.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough fiber in your diet—from plants like whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables—you’re going to have stomach issues, regardless of the protein powder, Sharp says.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A serving of protein powder a day is absolutely safe for folks to consume, especially when you’re combining that with…other sources of lean protein,” Sharp says. “It’s not that the protein itself is causing the issue, especially when eating plant-based sources of protein. The challenge comes when replacing other gut-supporting nutrients like fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why protein powder might overwhelm the gut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Sharp and Balk agree that there’s one pretty substantial reason why protein powders could be causing stomach issues: too much protein, too fast.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can slow gastric emptying,” Balk says, which means the protein will hang out in the stomach a bit longer and cause that unwelcomed discomfort. Additionally, having 25 to 30 grams of protein in just a few minutes in the form of a shake or smoothie can overwhelm the gut and lead to more bloating and gas, Sharp explains.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really easy to down a protein shake in a couple gulps versus how long it takes to eat a steak,” Balk adds. “It’s not so much about avoiding ingredients, it’s about slowing down consumption.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balk advises slowing down when you sip on a protein shake to help lessen the impact it has on your stomach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not designed for stomach comfort. It’s designed to get a lot of protein in. That sets us up for probable or possible stomach distress,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="5"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also might help to break up your protein intake—if you normally have two scoops of favorite protein powder in the morning, Balk recommends having one scoop in the morning and another later in the day so you don’t overwhelm your stomach all at once.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter when you’re ingesting the protein, it’s all going to do its job. It doesn’t need to be in one shot to work,” he says.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on protein:

On the flip side, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64206527/vo2-max-cognitive-decline-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64206527/vo2-max-cognitive-decline-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cognitive decline" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; can lead to accidents, memory loss, and even depression, she says. Fortunately, when it comes to supporting brain health and cognitive function, walking and strength training are both amazing, but in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64434477/4-week-walking-plan-burn-fat-build-muscle-pdf/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64434477/4-week-walking-plan-burn-fat-build-muscle-pdf/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walking" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="9.1.0"&gt;Walking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; increases blood flow to the brain, which boosts oxygen and nutrients to the areas responsible for memory and thinking, but it also helps lower stress and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="improve sleep" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which are two big players in cognitive health,” Pelc Graca says. In fact, aiming for around 10,000 steps a day may even be associated with a lower risk of developing dementia.

It found that walking more was associated with a lower risk of dementia, and the optimal amount of daily steps was just under 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457223002148" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457223002148" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stimulates the release of growth factors" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;stimulates the release of growth factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (naturally occurring substances that stimulate cell growth), which supports the formation of new neurons in the brain, Pelc Graca says. Lifting weights may also improve executive function and memory, per a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00527-7" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00527-7" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Springer Open" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.3.0.0"&gt;Springer Open&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 19 studies on the effects of resistance training on cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A combination of walking and resistance training is the ideal recipe for optimal brain health—and this finding is supported by a 2025 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260025000171" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260025000171" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0.0"&gt;International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 35 randomized controlled trials to determine the effects that aerobic and resistance training have on cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Walking can be a great gateway to more intense exercise, and may be the best starting place for folks who haven’t been active in a while, but ideally, it’s best to work up to incorporating both types of exercise” for longevity, says exercise physiologist Rachelle A. Reed, PhD, ACSM-EP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-bone-health" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

The good news? Weight-bearing movements like walking and resistance training help maintain and improve bone mineral density, the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue, so you’re less likely to experience fractures and more likely to stay on your feet for the long haul. Strength training has a slight edge at this over walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Walking slows age-related bone loss, especially in the hips and legs, since your bones work to support your body weight with each step, stimulating them to become stronger and denser, Pelc Graca says. As a result, frequent walks may reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63260413/wearing-weighted-vest-for-osteoporosis/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63260413/wearing-weighted-vest-for-osteoporosis/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="osteoporosis" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, per 2024 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11211113/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11211113/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Springer" data-node-id="18.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="18.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="18.3.0.0"&gt;Springer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study monitored 24,000 adults without osteoporosis over three years via questionnaires and found that those who engaged in outdoor walking regularly had a lower risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63025562/full-body-dumbbell-strength-workout/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63025562/full-body-dumbbell-strength-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Strength training" data-node-id="20.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="20.0.0"&gt;Strength training&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does more than just slow bone loss, though—it also stimulates new bone growth. “Strength training puts controlled stress on bones, signaling the body to build stronger, denser bone tissue,” Pelc Graca says. You can certainly add weight to your body while walking (hello, weighted vest), but there are limitations on the range of motion and weight you can use that actually impact bone preservation and muscle growth, says Natalya Vasquez, CPT, a certified personal trainer, health coach, and founder of On Your Terms Coaching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;However, the different exercises and directions your body moves weights in during resistance training also improves muscle mass, meaning better support for your skeleton, Vasquez says. This is particularly beneficial for older women and those post-menopause, since it helps counteract the bone loss that often occurs during this phase of life, according to a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.1029475/full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.1029475/full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Endocrinology" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.1.0.0"&gt;Endocrinology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.2"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-cardiovascular-health" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

As a result, taking care of your cardiovascular system is nonnegotiable for boosting longevity and fostering a longer, healthier lifespan, Pelc Graca says. Walking shines when it comes to supporting &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cardiovascular health" data-node-id="24.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, but strength training still plays a valuable role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10643563/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10643563/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walking boosts circulation" data-node-id="25.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.0.0"&gt;Walking boosts circulation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lowers blood pressure, supports healthy cholesterol levels, and improves insulin sensitivity, which are all key factors for keeping your heart in tip top shape, Pelc Graca says. Regular exercise like walking also helps manage stress, which can decrease blood pressure and the risk for heart attack and stroke, per the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Heart Association" data-node-id="25.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.2.0"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, because walking is low-impact, accessible, and doesn’t require equipment, it’s easier to do regularly, which is critical for long-term heart health, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That said, strength training still plays a valuable role in cardiovascular health since it &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64442140/intermittent-fasting-exercise-weight-loss-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64442140/intermittent-fasting-exercise-weight-loss-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reduces body fat" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="27.1.0"&gt;reduces body fat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, improves insulin sensitivity, and lowers mortality risk, per a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Exercise Sport and Movement" data-vars-ga-product-id="7c0d17ab-9b4b-49ba-89c8-f7b360e66069" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="27.3" data-href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" data-product-url="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="38ea9dc8-e08d-4945-9174-47ec6576f88c" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="27.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="27.3.0.0"&gt;Exercise Sport and Movement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that reviewed studies examining the long-term benefits of resistance training. However, during traditional strength training, you’ll likely take frequent rest breaks between sets where your heart rate will slow down, whereas your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65124371/heart-rate-walking-vs-running/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65124371/heart-rate-walking-vs-running/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart rate won’t decrease on a walk" data-node-id="27.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heart rate won’t decrease on a walk&lt;/a&gt;, which will make it stronger over time, Vasquez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-building-muscle-and-strength" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

A lack of muscle is also correlated to poor balance and an increased risk of falls, in turn, upping your chances of injury, says Pelc Graca: “Put simply, more strength equals more freedom to do the things you love for longer.” Strength training takes the cake for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="building muscle" data-node-id="30.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;building muscle&lt;/a&gt;, but walking still supports muscle maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training is the most effective way to build muscle and maintain muscle mass, which both naturally decline with age, Pelc Graca says. Resistance training provides a heavy load to the muscles, which will stimulate muscle growth (hypertrophy). It also improves neuromuscular coordination, the communication between the brain and the muscles, which enables movement, Reed says. This workout also enhances joint stability, balance, and improves range of motion, allowing you to stay stronger and independent for longer, per a 2023 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9935664/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9935664/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Springer" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="31.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="31.1.0.0"&gt;Springer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 55 studies on the benefits of resistance training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Besides strength, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="training power" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;training power&lt;/a&gt; is also imperative for being able to move well for as long as possible. “Unlike muscular strength, which refers to how much force a muscle can exert, muscular power combines force and speed,” says Reed. So, maintaining that power is important to do functional tasks like climbing stairs, catching yourself during a fall, or quickly standing up from a chair. Incorporating power movements like medicine ball throws and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63869209/how-to-do-kettlebell-swings-plus-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63869209/how-to-do-kettlebell-swings-plus-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kettlebell swings" data-node-id="33.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;kettlebell swings&lt;/a&gt; during strength training days can help maintain that force and speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As for walking, Pelc Graca says regular strolls preserve lower-body strength and endurance, especially in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28209151/calf-raises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28209151/calf-raises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calves" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.1.0"&gt;calves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19962155/hamstring-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19962155/hamstring-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hamstrings" data-node-id="34.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.3.0"&gt;hamstrings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64919230/best-glute-workouts-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64919230/best-glute-workouts-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="glutes" data-node-id="34.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.5.0"&gt;glutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63829177/standing-ab-core-workouts/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63829177/standing-ab-core-workouts/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="core" data-node-id="34.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.7.0"&gt;core&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Walking also promotes healthy joints and balance, making it easier to move freely and confidently with age. However, because walking is a singular range of motion exercise (you only move forward and backward), it excludes other major muscle groups from activating, therefore limiting overall muscle gains and strength, Vasquez says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-overall-longevity" data-node-id="35" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="35.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

"The same fungus once feared for bringing death may now help save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt; produces spores that are able to lie dormant for centuries — including inside sealed tombs. When disturbed, the fungus can cause deadly respiratory infections, particularly in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/college-student-discovers-psychedelic-fungus-that-eluded-lsd-inventor" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/college-student-discovers-psychedelic-fungus-that-eluded-lsd-inventor"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College student discovers psychedelic fungus that eluded LSD inventor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GT3jSuC9UzcakeGRbVSdDH" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GT3jSuC9UzcakeGRbVSdDH slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the scientists examined the unique chemical compounds produced by the fungus and discovered a class of natural compounds called RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides). These molecules are difficult to isolate and rarely seen in fungi, but they hold therapeutic promise due to their complex structures and bioactivity. This means they have intricate, unique shapes that can interact with biological systems in powerful ways, such as killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found four novel asperigimycins with an unusual interlocking ring structure," lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xuegaolab.org/team/" target="_blank" data-url="https://xuegaolab.org/team/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qiuyue Nie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher in chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, said in the statement. "Two of them had strong anti-leukemia properties even without modification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the drugs' effectiveness, the researchers attached lipid molecules similar to those found in royal jelly, the nutrient-rich substance that sustains queen bees. This enabled the drugs to enter cancer cells more efficiently, because lipids help drugs cross cellular membranes, which are made largely of fats themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed how a gene called SLC46A3 acts as a kind of molecular gateway, helping the drug escape cellular compartments and target leukemia cells directly. This discovery could aid in the delivery of other promising but hard-to-administer drugs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike broad-spectrum chemotherapy agents that can damage healthy cells, asperigimycins appear to specifically disrupt leukemia cell division without affecting healthy tissues. Early tests also suggest the compounds have minimal effects on breast, liver, and lung cancer cells. According to the researchers, this selectivity is important for minimizing unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to asperigimycins, the team believe similar life-saving compounds may be hidden in other fungal species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team are planning to test asperigimycins in animal models, with the eventual goal of launching human clinical trials. And by scanning fungal genomes and exploring more strains of Aspergillus, they hope to unlock new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ancient world is still offering us tools for modern medicine," said Gao. "The tombs were feared for their curses, but they may become a wellspring of cures."&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, men who were highly inflexible about their exercise and body image were more likely to engage in dysfunctional exercise when they also had a strong drive for muscularity. The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2025.101985"&gt;Eating Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive for muscularity is an individual’s desire to build muscle and achieve a lean, muscular physique. It is influenced by cultural ideals that associate muscularity with masculinity, strength, and attractiveness. This drive can motivate healthy behaviors such as regular exercise and balanced nutrition. However, in some cases, it can also lead to excessive workout routines, strict diets, and the use of performance-enhancing substances. High levels of drive for muscularity are linked to body dissatisfaction and conditions such as muscle dysmorphia. This is especially common among adolescent and young adult males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author, McKenzie L. Miller, and her colleagues sought to explore the role of cognitive inflexibility in the relationship between disordered exercise and the drive for muscularity in men. They hypothesized that the drive for muscularity would be associated with dysfunctional exercise in men who were highly inflexible about their body weight, shape, food, and exercise. Cognitive inflexibility is defined as difficulty adapting thoughts or behavior when faced with changes in goals, rules, or environmental demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 243 male undergraduate students with an average age of 19 years. Of these, 54% identified as White, and 94% identified as heterosexual. Participants completed an online survey administered via Qualtrics, including questionnaires on drive for muscularity (using the Drive for Muscularity Scale), cognitive flexibility (using the Eating Disorder Flexibility Index Questionnaire), and dysfunctional exercise (using the Exercise Dependence Scale–21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that participants with higher cognitive inflexibility were more prone to dysfunctional exercise. Here, “dysfunctional exercise” refers to patterns of excessive or rigid exercise behavior — for example, training despite injury, inability to adjust routines despite physical demands, or preoccupation with exercise to the detriment of well‑being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, cognitive inflexibility related to food, exercise, and body weight or shape (but not general cognitive inflexibility) strengthened the link between drive for muscularity and dysfunctional exercise. In other words, participants who were highly inflexible about their body and exercise habits were more likely to exhibit dysfunctional exercise when also highly driven by muscularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Results suggest that domain‑specific cognitive inflexibility amplifies the risk of dysfunctional exercise in men with a strong drive for muscularity. Findings point to the potential benefits of interventions targeting cognitive inflexibility to help mitigate this risk,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides valuable insights into the role of cognitive inflexibility in increasing vulnerability to disordered exercise behavior. However, its cross‑sectional design means that it cannot confirm a cause‑and‑effect relationship. Additionally, because the sample comprised exclusively male undergraduate students, the findings may not generalize to other demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015325000455?via%3Dihub"&gt;Cognitive inflexibility moderates the association between drive for muscularity and dysfunctional exercise in men&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by McKenzie L.

The green dotted line shows the cancer risk level for lead. The purple dotted line shows this risk level for antimony, and the red dotted line represents the risk value for non-cancer diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapor from three of the tested devices contained levels of lead and nickel above &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-431f3050-51c5-11f0-be71-2132733ea7a8"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; safety limits, and two had elevated levels of antimony - an element used in batteries and as a flame retardant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esco Bars in particular were found to release four to 13 times more lead in their first 200 puffs than a pack of 20 cigarettes. This is the same amount of lead exposure as smoking 19 cigarettes in a single day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And four devices sold by Esco had levels of lead and nickel linked to respiratory and lung diseases like asthma and lung scarring.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said while they only tested three out of 100 popular vape brands, the findings show concerning health risks for teens and young adults, who are most likely to use them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three heavy metals tested are considered potential carcinogens, meaning they could cause cancer. And all have been associated with lung cancer, while lead has been shown to increase the risk of lung, kidney and brain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nickel has also been associated with nasal and sinus cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though vapes are higher in these heavy metals than cigarettes, decades of research suggests cigarettes are still more dangerous because they contain about 7,000 carcinogens compared to 2,000 in vapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cigarettes have also long been proven to cause lung cancer, while research has not yet proven direct causation between vaping and the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brett Poulin, senior study author and assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Toxicology, said: 'Our study highlights the hidden risk of these new and popular disposable electronic cigarettes - with hazardous levels of neurotoxic lead and carcinogenic nickel and antimony - which stresses the need for urgency in enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These risks are not just worse than other e-cigarettes but worse in some cases than traditional cigarettes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Wednesday in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00641"&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed metal and metalloids - elements that have properties intermediate between metals and non-metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a device to heat and activate the e-cigarettes, they made each one generate between 500 and 1,500 puffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average vape user does about 100 to 200 puffs in a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ELF Bar, which is also sold as EB Design (pictured here), was the most popular disposable vape of 2023 and 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found vapors from three of the devices - ELF Bar Flavored, ELF Bar Clear and Esco Bar Flavored - exceeded cancer risk limits for nickel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Flum Pebble Flavored and Esco Bar Flavored exceeded these levels for antimony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Esco Bar Flavored and Esco Bar Clear had lead emissions&lt;span&gt; that surpassed health-risk thresholds for 'non-cancer disorders.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These include asthma and lung scarring fibrosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mark Salazar, first study author and PhD candidate in Poulin's lab, said: 'We found that these disposable devices have toxins already present in the e-liquid, or they’re leaching quite extensively from their components into e-liquids and ultimately transferred to the smoke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic shows the heavy metals in different parts of the tested disposable vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-cc476540-512b-11f0-b8db-d54750c05e00" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; identified ELF as the most popular vape brand among teens and young adults in 2023 and 2024. And Esco Bars sold about $82million worth of products in the US in 2022, the latest data available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No flavored e-cigarettes are legal for sale in the US, though the FDA has authorized a limited number of unflavored ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both varieties remain pervasive at convenience stores and through online retailers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sales data &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/illegal-us-vape-sales-worth-least-24-billion-2024-data-shows-2025-02-24/"&gt;reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt; estimated $2.4billion worth of illegal vapes were sold in the US last year, which experts say is particularly concerning because they are not regulated or tested by any oversight agency so it's unclear what's in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About six percent of US adults - about 17million - vape, according to the latest CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And roughly six percent of middle school students and eight percent of high school students report vaping at least once in the last 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While they have generally been considered a safer alternative to smoking tobacco and promoted as a smoking cessation aid, recent research suggests e-cigarettes may increase the risk of heart and lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a case study published this month, a New Jersey man died of what's thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14821431/New-Jersey-man-worlds-documented-cancer-case-tied-habit-affects-13million.html"&gt;first documented case of lung cancer caused by e-cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that aging isn’t just a local cellular process—it can spread throughout the body via the bloodstream. A redox-sensitive protein called ReHMGB1, secreted by senescent cells, was found to trigger aging features in distant tissues, impairing regeneration and muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blocking ReHMGB1 with antibodies in mice reduced cellular aging markers and improved physical performance after injury. These findings identify a key molecular messenger of systemic aging and offer a promising therapeutic target to slow or reverse age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Spreads Through Blood:&lt;/strong&gt; ReHMGB1 transmits senescence signals from one tissue to another.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversible Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking HMGB1 improved tissue repair and function in aging mice.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting circulating HMGB1 could help treat age-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Korea University College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time in the world, a Korean research team discovered how cellular aging can spread systemically through the bloodstream—offering new insights and a potential therapeutic strategy to combat aging-related decline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor Ok Hee Jeon’s research group at the Department of Convergence Medicine, Korea University’s College of Medicine, discovered that High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1),a key extracellular senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor, plays a critical role in transmitting senescence from aging cells to distant tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells are known to secrete pro-inflammatory factors and signaling molecules—collectively known as SASP—which induce paracrine senescence in surrounding cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over time, these senescent cells accumulate in various tissues, impairing regenerative capacity and contributing to tissue dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which senescence spreads systemically remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their latest study published in &lt;em&gt;Metabolism &lt;/em&gt;– Clinical and Experimental (Impact Factor 10.9, top 4.6% in endocrinology and metabolism), Professor Jeon’s team provides the first evidence that reduced HMGB1 (ReHMGB1), a redox-sensitive isoform of HMGB1, circulates through the bloodstream and induces senescence in remote tissues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using both in vitro and in vivo models, the researchers demonstrated that extracellular ReHMGB1, but not its oxidized form (OxHMGB1), robustly induces senescence-like features in multiple human cell types—including fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells, and skeletal muscle cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice systemically treated with ReHMGB1 exhibited elevated senescence markers (p21, p16), increased SASP factor expression, and impaired muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in a muscle injury model in middle-aged mice, administration of anti-HMGB1 antibodies not only reduced senescence markers but also enhanced muscle regeneration and improved physical performance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting extracellular HMGB1 to reverse or mitigate age-related tissue dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study reveals that aging signals are not confined to individual cells but can be systemically transmitted via the blood, with ReHMGB1 acting as a key driver,” said Professor Jeon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By blocking this pathway, we were able to restore tissue regenerative capacity, suggesting a promising strategy to treat aging-related diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Myokine Research Center (MRC) and the Mid-sized Research Support Project of the Ministry of Science and ICT. and was conducted in collaboration with internationally recognized experts in aging biology, including Professor Irina Conboy of UC Berkeley and Professor Christopher Wiley of Turfts University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propagation of senescent phenotypes by extracellular HMGB1 is dependent on its redox state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background &amp;amp; purpose&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence spreads systemically through blood circulation, but its mechanisms remain unclear. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a multifunctional senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor, exists in various redox states. Here, we investigate the role of redox-sensitive HMGB1 (ReHMGB1) in driving paracrine and systemic senescence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We applied the paracrine senescence cultured model to evaluate the effect of ReHMGB1 on cellular senescence. Each redox state of HMGB1 was treated extracellularly to assess systemic senescence both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Senescence was determined by SA-β-gal &amp;amp; EdU staining, p16&lt;sup&gt;INK4a&lt;/sup&gt; and p21 expression, RT-qPCR, and Western blot methods. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to investigate ReHMGB1-driven transcriptional changes and underlying pathways. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cytokine arrays characterized SASP profiles from ReHMGB1-treated cells. &lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt;, young mice were administered ReHMGB1 systemically to induce senescence across multiple tissues. A muscle injury model in middle-aged mice was used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of HMGB1 blockade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extracellular ReHMGB1, but not its oxidized form, robustly induced senescence-like phenotypes across multiple cell types and tissues. Transcriptomic analysis revealed activation of RAGE-mediated JAK/STAT and NF-κB pathways, driving SASP expression and cell cycle arrest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cytokine profiling confirmed paracrine senescence features induced by ReHMGB1. ReHMGB1 administration elevated senescence markers &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, while HMGB1 inhibition reduced senescence, attenuated systemic inflammation, and enhanced muscle regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ReHMGB1 is a redox-dependent pro-geronic factor driving systemic senescence. Targeting extracellular HMGB1 may offer therapeutic potential for preventing aging-related pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s going to replace &lt;a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/the-three-rs-research-rumination-and-reassurance"&gt;Googling as a compulsion&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s going to be even more reinforcing than Googling, because you can ask such specific questions. And I think also people assume that ChatGPT is always correct.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People turn to ChatGPT with all sorts of worries, from the stereotypical “How do I know if I’ve washed my hands enough?” (&lt;a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/contamination-ocd-fear-of-germs"&gt;contamination OCD&lt;/a&gt;) to the lesser-known “What if I did something immoral?” (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-many-obsessions-that-can-haunt-a-person-with-ocd/"&gt;scrupulosity OCD&lt;/a&gt;) or “Is my fiance the love of my life or am I making a huge mistake?” (&lt;a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/relationship-ocd"&gt;relationship OCD&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Once, I was worried about my partner dying on a plane,” a writer in New York, who was diagnosed with OCD in her thirties and who asked to remain anonymous, told me. “At first, I was asking ChatGPT fairly generically, ‘What are the chances?’ And of course it said it’s very unlikely. But then I kept thinking: Okay, but is it more likely if it’s this kind of plane? What if it’s flying this kind of route?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For two hours, she pummeled ChatPGT with questions. She knew that this wasn’t actually helping her — but she kept going. “ChatGPT comes up with these answers that make you feel like you’re digging to somewhere,” she said, “even if you’re actually just stuck in the mud.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-chatgpt-reinforces-reassurance-seeking" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How ChatGPT reinforces reassurance seeking &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A classic hallmark of OCD is what psychologists call “reassurance seeking.” While everyone will occasionally ask friends or loved ones for reassurance, &lt;a href="https://iocdf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/18-Information-seekers-vs-reassurance-seekers.pdf"&gt;it’s different for people with OCD&lt;/a&gt;, who tend to ask the same question repeatedly in a quest to get uncertainty down to zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The goal of that behavior is to relieve anxiety or distress. After getting an answer, the distress does sometimes decrease — but it’s only temporary. Soon enough, new doubts arise and the cycle starts again, with the creeping sense that more questions must be asked in order to reach greater certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you ask your friend for reassurance on the same topic 50 times, they’ll probably realize that something is going on and that it might not actually be helpful for you to stay in this conversational loop. But an AI chatbot is happy to keep answering all your questions, and then the doubts you have about its answers, and then the doubts you have about its answers to your doubts, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, ChatGPT will naively play along with reassurance-seeking behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“That actually just makes the OCD worse. It becomes that much harder to resist doing it again,” Levine said. Instead of continuing to compulsively seek definitive answers, the clinical consensus is that people with OCD need to accept that sometimes we can’t get rid of uncertainty — we just have to sit with it and learn to tolerate it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The “gold standard” treatment for OCD is exposure and response prevention (ERP), in which people are exposed to the troubling questions that obsess them and then resist the urge to engage in a compulsion like reassurance-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Levine, who pioneered the use of &lt;a href="https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/how-do-i-stop-thinking-about-this-what-to-do-when-youre-stuck-playing-mental-ping-pong/"&gt;non-engagement responses&lt;/a&gt; — statements that affirm the presence of anxiety rather than trying to escape it through compulsions — noted that there’s another way in which an AI chatbot is more tempting than Googling for answers, as many OCD sufferers do. Whereas the search engine just links you to a variety of websites, state-of-the-art AI systems promise to help you analyze and &lt;a href="/future-perfect/400531/ai-reasoning-models-openai-deepseek"&gt;reason through a complex problem&lt;/a&gt;. That is extremely enticing — “OCD loves that!” Levine said — but for someone suffering from the disorder, it can too easily become a lengthy exercise in co-rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="reasoning-machine-or-rumination-machine" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Reasoning machine or rumination machine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to one evidence-based approach to treating OCD, called &lt;a href="https://iocdf.org/ocd-treatment-guide/i-cbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inference-based cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (I-CBT), people with OCD are prone to a faulty reasoning pattern that draws on a mix of personal experiences, rules, hearsay, facts, and possibilities. That gives rise to obsessive doubts and tricks them into feeling like they need to listen to those doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Joseph Harwerth, an OCD and anxiety specialist, offers an illustration of how trying to reason with the help of an AI chatbot can actually further confuse the “obsessional reasoning” of people with OCD. Considering what you might do if you have a cut on your finger and struggle with contamination OCD — where people fear becoming sullied or sullying others with germs, dirt, or other contaminants — &lt;a href="https://wetreatocd.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ocd"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;, “You wonder: Can I get tetanus from touching a doorknob? You may go to ChatGPT to investigate the validity of that doubt.” Here’s how he imagines the conversation going: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote _1c7w9tz0 xkp0cg9"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you wash your hands if they feel dirty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A1:&lt;/strong&gt; “Yes, you should wash your hands if they feel dirty. That sensation usually means there is something on your skin, like dirt, oil, sweat, or germs, that you will want to remove.” (When asked for its reasoning, ChatGPT said it based its answer on sources from the CDC and WHO.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I get tetanus from a doorknob?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A2:&lt;/strong&gt; “It is extremely unlikely to get tetanus from a doorknob, unless you have an open wound and somehow rubbed soil or contaminated material into it via the doorknob.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q3:&lt;/strong&gt; Can people have tetanus without realizing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A3:&lt;/strong&gt; “It is rare, but in the very early stages, some people might not immediately realize they have tetanus, especially if the wound seemed minor or was overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote _1c7w9tz0 xkp0cg9"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then, your OCD creates this story: &lt;em&gt;I feel dirty when I touch doorknobs (personal experience). It is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;recommended by the CDC to wash your hands if you feel dirty (rules). I read online that people can get tetanus from touching a doorknob (hearsay). Germs can spread through contact (general facts). It is possible that someone touched my door without knowing they had tetanus and then spread it on my doorknob (possibility).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this scenario, the chatbot enables the user to construct a narrative that justifies their obsessional fear. It doesn’t guide the user away from obsessional reasoning — it just provides fodder for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Part of the problem, Harwerth says, is that a chatbot doesn’t have enough context about each user, unless the user thinks to provide it, so it doesn’t know when someone has OCD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“ChatGPT can fall into the same trap that non-OCD specialists fall into,” Harwerth told me. “The trap is: Oh, let’s have a conversation about your thoughts. What could have led you to have these thoughts? What does this mean about you?” While that might be a helpful approach for a client who doesn’t have OCD, it can backfire when a psychologist engages in that kind of therapy with someone suffering from OCD, because it encourages them to keep ruminating on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s more, because chatbots can be sycophants, they may just validate whatever the user says instead of challenging it. A chatbot that’s overly flattering and supportive of a user’s thoughts — &lt;a href="/future-perfect/411318/openai-chatgpt-4o-artificial-intelligence-sam-altman-chatbot-personality"&gt;like ChatGPT was for a time&lt;/a&gt; — can be dangerous for people with mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="whose-job-is-it-to-prevent-the-compulsive-use-of-chatgpt" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Whose job is it to prevent the compulsive use of ChatGPT?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If using a chatbot can exacerbate OCD symptoms, is it the responsibility of the company behind the chatbot to protect vulnerable users? Or is it the users’ responsibility to learn how not to use ChatGPT, just as they’ve had to learn not to use Google or WebMD for reassurance-seeking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I think it’s on both,” Harwerth told me. “We cannot perfectly curate the world to people with OCD — they have to understand their own condition and how that leaves them vulnerable to misusing applications. In the same breath, I would say that when people explicitly ask the AI model to behave as a trained therapist” — which some users with mental health conditions do — “I do think it’s important for the model to say, ‘I’m pulling this from these sources. However, I’m not a trained therapist.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Levine, for her part, agreed that the burden can’t rest solely on the companies. “It wouldn’t be fair to make it their responsibility, just like it wouldn’t be fair to make Google responsible for all the compulsive Googling. But it would be great if even just a warning could come up, like, ‘This seems perhaps compulsive.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, acknowledged in &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/15987609-5f71-433c-9972-e91131f399a1/openai-affective-use-study.pdf"&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; that the chatbot can foster problematic behavior patterns. “We observe a trend that longer usage is associated with lower socialization, more emotional dependence and more problematic use,” the study finds, defining the latter as “indicators of addiction to ChatGPT usage, including preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, and mood modification” as well as “indicators of potentially compulsive or unhealthy interaction patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We know that ChatGPT can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals, and that means the stakes are higher,” an OpenAI spokesperson told me in an email. “We’re working to better understand and reduce ways ChatGPT might unintentionally reinforce or amplify existing, negative behavior…We’re doing this so we can continue refining how our models identify and respond appropriately in sensitive conversations, and we’ll continue updating the behavior of our models based on what we learn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;(Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI.

But if a chatbot is essentially diagnosing a user, that raises serious privacy concerns.

Would you like to take a walk?’” she said. “Maybe wording it like that can interrupt the loop, without insinuating that someone has a mental illness, whether they do or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While there’s some &lt;a href="https://medicine.stanford.edu/news/current-news/standard-news/AI-ocd-diagnosis.html"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that AI could correctly identify OCD, it’s not clear how it could pick up on compulsive behaviors without covertly or overtly classifying the user as having OCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This is not me saying that OpenAI is responsible for making sure I don’t do this,” the writer added. “But I do think there are ways to make it easier for me to help myself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxORW9zN2RzQU1MbHRoaVg1VkJKX2FRWjRVU041RFNVTEY4T3dwZTZtTFpiNXZSNXJRMnlDRDVVcUNhcE56Q0pialVjTnVkdDJSVnE5RHgyWGZHaWxJaXJrdTdyZEZHR1FtaWh0aTZ5MGJ3VWNkc3V3Rmg3VEFBWGRTQnpiRlJrckM4czZFNXE0MXlrRDNObV9YaWJsQQ</guid></item><item><title>咖啡因增强细胞对抗衰老的能量-神经科学新闻 | Caffeine Gives Cells an Energy Boost Against Aging - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9pY0hXV2RmVGxFWnBCeWlWakd1cEpzcjFrVkpwNzluYWdfNWVxMjZ1Z0tGRDZxRGlEazluYVV6MzZ1N0JuY1NPbGdCd25ReC1jc0FhT1ptNjZWSzhqQ0FaZlFJYXNjUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that caffeine may help slow ageing at the cellular level by activating AMPK, a key energy-sensing pathway. Using fission yeast as a model for human cells, scientists found that caffeine boosts AMPK activity, which helps cells manage stress, repair DNA, and regulate growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMPK is also targeted by metformin, a diabetes drug under investigation for lifespan extension. These findings offer new insight into how caffeine interacts with ancient cellular systems that protect against age-related damage and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMPK Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine boosts AMPK, a cellular “fuel gauge” tied to longevity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; The energy-stress network influenced by caffeine is over 500 million years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeast Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings in fission yeast reveal mechanisms likely conserved in human cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Queen Mary’s University London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the Cellular Ageing and Senescence laboratory at Queen Mary University of London’s Cenfre for Molecular Cell Biology, reveals how caffeine—the world’s most popular neuroactive compound—might do more than just wake you up. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study in the journal&lt;em&gt; Microbial Cell &lt;/em&gt;shows how caffeine could play a role in slowing down the ageing process at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111148"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice.jpg" alt="This shows a man drinking coffee and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/caffeine-cell-aging-neuroscice-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Interestingly, AMPK is also the target of metformin, a common diabetes drug that’s being studied for its potential to extend human lifespan together with rapamycin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine has long been linked to potential health benefits, including reduced risk of age-related diseases. But how it works inside our cells, and what exactly are its connections with nutrient and stress responsive gene and protein networks has remained a mystery—until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new research published by scientists studying &lt;em&gt;fission yeast&lt;/em&gt;—a single-celled organism surprisingly similar to human cells—researchers found that caffeine affects ageing by tapping into an ancient cellular energy system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the same research team found that caffeine helps cells live longer by acting on a growth regulator called TOR (Target of Rapamycin). TOR is a biological switch that tells cells when to grow, based on how much food and energy is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This switch has been controlling energy and stress responses in living things for over 500 million years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in their latest study, the scientists made a surprising discovery: caffeine doesn’t act on this growth switch directly. Instead, it works by activating another important system called AMPK, a cellular fuel gauge that is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When your cells are low on energy, AMPK kicks in to help them cope,” explains Dr Charalampos (Babis) Rallis, Reader in Genetics, Genomics and Fundamental Cell Biology at Queen Mary University of London, the study’s senior author. “And our results show that caffeine helps flip that switch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, AMPK is also the target of &lt;strong&gt;metformin&lt;/strong&gt;, a common diabetes drug that’s being studied for its potential to extend human lifespan together with rapamycin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using their yeast model, the researchers showed that caffeine’s effect on AMPK influences how cells grow, repair their DNA, and respond to stress—all of which are tied to ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings help explain why caffeine might be beneficial for health and longevity,” said Dr John-Patrick Alao the postdoctoral research scientist leading this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And they open up exciting possibilities for future research into how we might trigger these effects more directly—with diet, lifestyle, or new medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you reach for your coffee, you might be doing more than just boosting your focus—you could also be giving your cells a helping hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#74185a13061502110734051901185a15175a011f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lucia Graves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://qmul.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Queen Mary’s University of London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lucia Graves – Queen Mary’s University of London&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Microbial Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:28:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9pY0hXV2RmVGxFWnBCeWlWakd1cEpzcjFrVkpwNzluYWdfNWVxMjZ1Z0tGRDZxRGlEazluYVV6MzZ1N0JuY1NPbGdCd25ReC1jc0FhT1ptNjZWSzhqQ0FaZlFJYXNjUQ</guid></item><item><title>一次性电子烟比传统香烟更有毒-加州大学戴维斯分校 | Disposable E-Cigarettes More Toxic Than Traditional Cigarettes - UC Davis</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNcEdvU084S0dDNENJUW1tTFp4aXdqNHU2d1YwSm5PZFg3bmJlUzZoRlhYaUJtdzhGVlllaEhvdWR1bTdTZU5zV3hydTNZUThnWEt1emtxQ2tvQS0wNDJ0Qlgwai1qaUVTVk5qZlZuMExITDRLdXNPN1RxX1RwMXcxb3ctQ3JRMVZZbVkzRVExWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dropcap clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may look like travel shampoo bottles and smell like bubblegum, but after a few hundred puffs, some disposable, electronic cigarettes and vape pods release higher amounts of toxic metals than older e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, according to a study from the University of California, Davis. For example, one of the disposable e-cigarettes studied released more lead during a day’s use than nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00641"&gt;The study, published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/em&gt;, noted that although most disposable e-cigarettes are illegal in the United States, they remain widely available. Most consumers of disposable e-cigarettes are teens or young adults, who are also highly susceptible to lead exposure. &lt;span&gt;Inhaling certain metals can increase a person’s risk of cancer, respiratory disease and nerve damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our study highlights the hidden risk of these new and popular disposable electronic cigarettes — with hazardous levels of neurotoxic lead and carcinogenic nickel and antimony — which stresses the need for urgency in enforcement,” said senior author Brett Poulin, an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Toxicology. “T&lt;/span&gt;hese risks are not just worse than other e-cigarettes but worse in some cases than traditional cigarettes.”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘What are you smoking?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Mark Salazar, a Ph.D. candidate in Poulin’s lab, first saw a disposable vape pod when he was visiting a friend. The pods are self-contained cartridges that hold a battery, e-liquid and heating coil. Salazar was curious: What, exactly, was his friend smoking? He brought the pod back to the lab at UC Davis and tested its vapor for metal concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I first saw the lead concentrations, they were so high I thought our instrument was broken,” Salazar said. “That sparked us into looking further into these disposables.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When I first saw the lead concentrations, they were so high I thought our instrument was broken.” —Mark Salazar, UC Davis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists analyzed the metal and metalloids inside seven types of disposable devices from three of the most popular brands. Using an instrument to activate the disposable e-cigarettes and heat the internal liquid, they created between 500 and 1,500 puffs for each device. They found:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list--arrow"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some devices emitted surprisingly high concentrations of elements in the vapor, including antimony and lead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Levels of chromium, nickel and antimony increased as the number of puffs increased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the disposable e-cigarettes tested released markedly higher amounts of metals and metalloids into vapors than earlier, refillable vapes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then took apart the devices to trace the sources of the metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that these disposable devices have toxins already present in the e-liquid, or they’re leaching quite extensively from their components into e-liquids and ultimately transferred to the smoke,” Salazar said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaded bronze alloy components in some devices leached nickel and lead to the e-liquid. Nickel was also released from heating coils, and antimony was present in unused e-liquids at high levels, both of which increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understudied health risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also assessed the health risk for daily users. Vapors from three of the devices had nickel levels and two devices had antimony levels that exceeded cancer risk limits. Vapors from four of the devices had nickel and lead emissions that surpassed health-risk thresholds for illnesses besides cancer, such as neurological damage and respiratory diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the researchers tested only three of the nearly 100 disposable e-cigarette brands on the market, they say this initial work prompts concern given the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes, especially among adolescents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The market is also outpacing science. Few studies of the relatively new devices are available, leaving consumers and regulators largely uninformed. The work underscores the need to enforce regulations around illegal e-cigarettes while continuing research to reveal the extent of the problem and its public health implications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors include Lalima Saini, Tran Nguyen, Kent Pinkerton, Amy Madi and Austin Cole of UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was supported with funding from &lt;span&gt;the UC Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences T32 training program, and the University of California Agricultural Experiment Station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; is a 200-year-old peer-reviewed weekly medical journal from the United Kingdom. Since its launch, the journal has expanded into a family of more than 20 speciality journals and has set up several global Lancet Commissions on various important issues in medicine and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release issued a day ago, the journal said that since its inception in 1974, the World Health Organisation’s Essential Programme on Immunisation (EPI) achieved “unprecedented progress”, averting the deaths of an estimated 154 million children worldwide through routine childhood vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it said that as per a major new analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study Vaccine Coverage Collaborators, “Despite the progress of the past 50 years, the last two decades have also been marked by stagnating childhood vaccination rates and wide variation in vaccine coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These challenges have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases and death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study, titled: “Global, regional, and national trends in routine childhood vaccination coverage from 1980 to 2023 with forecasts to 2030: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023”, said that the latest estimates should be taken as a “clear warning” that global immunisation targets for 2030 would not be achieved without “transformational improvements in equity”, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the WHO set ambitious goals for improving vaccine coverage globally through the &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1668378"&gt;Immunisation Agenda 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from 2023, which the analysis is based upon, more than half of the world’s 15.7 million unvaccinated children were living in just eight countries, with 53 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 13pc in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the monumental efforts of the past 50 years, progress has been far from universal. Large numbers of children remain under and un-vaccinated,” senior study author Dr Jonathan Mosser from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal pointed out that the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges with global coverage rates of the original EPI-recommended vaccines declining sharply beginning in 2020, resulting in an estimated 15.6m children missing the full three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine or a measles vaccine between 2020 and 2023, as well as 15.9m children not receiving any polio vaccine and 9.18m missing out on the tuberculosis vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Covid-19 pandemic also reversed previous gains in reducing the number of unvaccinated zero-dose children globally, which peaked at 18.6m before falling to 15.7m by 2023. The study estimates that disruptions to immunisation services during the Covid pandemic resulted in around 12.8m additional unvaccinated zero-dose children globally during the four pandemic years (2020-2023).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stressed that “accelerated progress” would be necessary to achieve the 2030 target of halving the number of zero-dose children compared to 2019 levels, with only 18 of 204 countries and territories estimated to have already met this target as of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that population pressures would also add a “double burden to already overstretched healthcare systems that are ill-equipped to handle the substantial growth in vaccine target populations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors called for more concerted efforts to tackle vaccine misinformation and hesitancy to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="pakistans-situation" href="#pakistans-situation" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pakistan’s situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that Pakistan had the highest number of children with zero doses of vaccines after India in South Asia, with 419,000 children falling into that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Increasing numbers of wild-type polio cases have been reported in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the press release stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Polio Programme &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, in a bid to support routine vaccination, Unicef &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906168"&gt;handed&lt;/a&gt; over 31 refrigerated trucks to the Federal Directorate of Immunisation, with the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                            &lt;div&gt;&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2019/09/04/cleveland-clinic-survey-men-will-do-almost-anything-to-avoid-going-to-the-doctor" title="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2019/09/04/cleveland-clinic-survey-men-will-do-almost-anything-to-avoid-going-to-the-doctor" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;Cleveland Clinic survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that men would rather do household chores than go to the doctor, underscoring the fact that males are less likely than females to use preventative healthcare services. Unfortunately, this leads to higher rates of late-stage diagnoses and preventable complications among men. June is Men’s Health Month, and the perfect time for men to step up their game and take better care of their health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease and cancer are the two leading causes of death for men in the U.S. Thankfully, early detection of these diseases allows for a range of preventative treatments. A key example is colorectal cancer, which&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782123001212" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782123001212" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; more often among men than women, and can be diagnosed and treated early with regular colonoscopies.  As such, men need to be better armed with information about healthcare’s complexity and constantly changing rules, which can be seen as an impediment to seeking preventative care. Though men are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121551/" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121551/" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;less likely to ask for help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; from a healthcare professional, they should not try to go through this alone and, fortunately, they don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few simple tips to help men navigate the healthcare landscape more effectively and empower them to take better control of their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with healthcare insurance. Men must take the time to understand their insurance plan -- what it covers and what it doesn’t, which doctors are in-network and which aren’t and the details of any co-pay. This can take some work for men, especially fathers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/04/17/families-often-have-chief-medical-officers-and-theyre-almost-always-women" title="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/04/17/families-often-have-chief-medical-officers-and-theyre-almost-always-women" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; that mothers handle as much as 80 percent of a family’s medical decision-making responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, learn the terminology. Like every other profession, healthcare has its own language and jargon (and endless acronyms). Take the time to learn common terms and phrases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/your-health-resources/health-tools/dictionary/" title="https://familydoctor.org/your-health-resources/health-tools/dictionary/" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;Plain-language medical dictionaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; can help patients understand healthcare terminology, which can sound to many like a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is a common resource used to answer healthcare questions. But sometimes, people can feel buried under a pile of search results, not knowing which to prioritize. AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and others, provide answers in direct, easy-to-understand language. Make sure you ask them to provide sources for their information. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/" title="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;2023 Pew Research Center study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; showed that men are more likely to be familiar with AI than women, so men have a ready on-ramp to learn more about their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men should think about what questions they want to ask their healthcare providers before they have an appointment and write them down. What options are there for treatment? What are the risks/advantages?  If applicable, what will recovery or rehabilitation look like? If treatment involves a procedure, where will the procedure take place? Helpful tip: Think about this like a cherished hobby or a period of history you want to learn everything about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men and women often engage with the healthcare systems at the worst moments of their lives. It is difficult enough for a patient to understand the healthcare process and make informed decisions when they are healthy. Doing so is nearly impossible when they are in distress or pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs an advocate – men, too. Ideally, a friend or family member who is capable, clear-headed and assertive can fill this important support role. When patients are in crisis, they are at a disadvantage and often feel unable to do anything other than agree with doctors. This is why they need someone at their side to ask probing questions and to push back when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone has this sort of friend or family member. As an alternative, many hospitals have patient advocates on staff. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patientadvocate.org/" title="https://www.patientadvocate.org/" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;Patient Advocate Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; offers case management, financial aid and resources for learning more about Medicare. Many hospitals and clinics also offer financial assistance programs for patients who can’t afford care. Men shouldn’t hesitate to ask about these options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active patients are the best-cared-for patients. Patients, especially older patients, often defer to the expertise and authority of physicians. But if patients don’t understand something a doctor says, they should not hesitate to ask for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the appointment, men should take notes or ask their friend or family member to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's well-documented that men spend less time thinking about and engaging in their own healthcare. With the focus on men’s health this month, it’s the perfect time to change that. Men’s friends and families are depending on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wayne County Health Department announced Monday that Illinois’ first human case of West Nile Virus (WNV) in 2025 has been confirmed in a Wayne County resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the individual was hospitalized due to complications from the virus but has since been discharged and is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito, which contracts the virus by feeding on infected birds. Most individuals show no symptoms, but those who do may experience fever, nausea, headaches, and muscle aches lasting days or weeks. In rare instances, WNV can cause severe neurological conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, or even death. The elderly and individuals with weakened immune systems are at highest risk for serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far in 2025, 19 counties in Illinois have reported WNV activity through positive mosquito, horse, or human cases. These include: Bureau, Christian, Clinton, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Fulton, Grundy, Hancock, Henry, Marshall, McDonough, McHenry, Peoria, Scott, Stark, Tazewell, Wayne, and Winnebago. In 2024, the state recorded 69 human cases of WNV, including 13 deaths, the most since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we are seeing the first human case of West Nile virus so early in the season serves as a timely reminder—especially for seniors and those with weakened immune systems—to protect yourself from illnesses caused by mosquito bites,” said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. “I encourage all Illinoisans to ‘Fight the Bite’ and take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDPH Offers the Public Three Key Prevention Steps: Reduce, Repel, and Report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDUCE exposure by avoiding the outdoors during peak mosquito activity (dusk to dawn), fixing damaged screens, and eliminating standing water around homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPEL mosquitoes using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Wear long sleeves and pants when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPORT potential mosquito breeding sites such as stagnant water in ditches, containers, or flooded yards to local municipal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is providing $2.8 million in funding to local health departments across the state to support mosquito control efforts, including larvicide application, vector surveillance, and public education campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about West Nile virus, visit the Illinois Department of Public Health’s website at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📍 www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/wnv.htm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats are a top energy-boosting grain thanks to fiber, complex carbs, and rich nutrient profile that promotes steady energy and long-lasting fullness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grain oats offer more benefits than processed instant varieties, providing key vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats from all parts of the grain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats are incredibly versatile—perfect for everything from breakfast bowls to savory burgers—making it easy to enjoy their energizing benefits throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/how-to-boost-energy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; is, well, the whole point. And enjoyment, of course! To feel your best, picking foods that suit your lifestyle needs and nutrition goals can be the key to meeting your goals, be it staying alert throughout the workday or powering through &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/workouts/how-to-start-working-out" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;a workout&lt;/a&gt;. Grains don’t always get the best nutritional reputation, thanks to a longtime, outdated, and off base villainizing of carbohydrates.

According to The Mayo Clinic&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating whole grains, which are naturally high in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and a plethora of vitamins, can help reduce the risk of stroke, heart and blood vessel disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and more. Whole grains also can create a feeling of fullness after eating them, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/tips-for-staying-energized-8773555" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;keep energy levels up&lt;/a&gt; and sugar-crash-inducing &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-snacks-to-eat-between-meals-8788300" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;snacking&lt;/a&gt; down.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best grain to eat for energy may very likely be a recognizable ingredient &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/superfoods-you-should-always-stock-in-pantry-8776195" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in your pantry&lt;/a&gt;. Oats are the best grain to eat when you’re looking for an energy boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/are-oats-good-for-you-8782060" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Oats&lt;/a&gt; are rich in fiber and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-carbohydrates-7566945" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;complex carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;,” says Sandra Avitia, MS, RD, LDN. Available gluten-free, oats can be enjoyed in a range of diets and have multiple health benefits. “Oats are a versatile ingredient that can be used in a variety of hot and cold dishes, as well as in desserts. They provide the energy the body requires, and they provide more of a prolonged satiety,” Avitia adds. “[Oats] have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-grains-8716004" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fiber, and vitamins.”   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing which type of oats to eat for energy, go for whole grain oats, not &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/rolled-oats-vs-quick-oats-11683438" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;instant oats&lt;/a&gt;, which have been processed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Whole grains contain all parts of the grain,” Ativia explains. “The bran provides essential vitamins A, B, and E, along with minerals such as &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-phosphorus-7567264" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, and selenium.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of oats’ best qualities is their versatility—they’re enjoyable hot or cold, sweet or savory, and can be incorporated in multiple meals per day. Here are a few recipes with oats to try, which will give you a noticeable burst of energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; PB&amp;amp;J Overnight Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Letting oats infuse with liquid overnight is perhaps the easiest way to make oats. Making them in individual jars also creates a super simple grab-and-go breakfast packed with nutrition. Try this PB&amp;amp;J oats recipe, and feel free to modify it with your favorite &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nut-butter-at-the-supermarket-11681547" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nut butters&lt;/a&gt; and jams.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Maple, Pear, and Pecan Slow Cooker Steel-Cut Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you prefer your oats served warm, look no further than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/easy-slow-cooker-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the slow cooker&lt;/a&gt;. A set it and forget it recipe helps cook your oats while you sleep, so a warm breakfast awaits in the morning.  These maple, pear, and pecan oats simmer slowly to infuse each bite with a sweet and nutty autumnal flavor you can enjoy year-round.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a big batch of oatmeal to serve a crowd or meal prep at the beginning of the week, break out your favorite baking dish. Baked oatmeal has a nice crispness on top and gooeyness on the inside, and can be served by the scoop or sliced like a brownie. Try our berry baked oatmeal, or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/apple-pumpkin-baked-oatmeal-8402638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a cozy apple and pumpkin version&lt;/a&gt; that’s ready in under an hour.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats are great to use as a binder in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-cheese-for-burgers-8775864" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;burgers&lt;/a&gt; and meatballs instead of breadcrumbs. They’re gluten-free, add fiber, and easily absorb flavor. Quickly processing the oats makes them easy to fold into dishes like these black bean oat burgers or our &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/salmon-patties-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;homemade salmon patties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making your own granola helps you control exactly which ingredients you use, and allows you to adjust the flavor as desired. The key ingredient in granola: Oats. Try this savory, seedy granola, which can work well as a salad topping or veggie garnish, or on top of a yogurt parfait or chia seed pudding.&lt;br&gt;

The Romans &lt;a href="https://historyandarchaeologyonline.com/how-did-the-romans-manage-pregnancy/"&gt;hypothesized&lt;/a&gt; (wrongly) that boys caused more nausea in their mothers and advised women to fast for one day and take a hot wine bath to combat symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the 1960s, doctors were prescribing seemingly more effective drugs to combat the barfing. When one such drug, thalidomide, &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2018/after-60-years-scientists-uncover-how-thalidomide-produced-birth-defects"&gt;turned out&lt;/a&gt; to cause birth defects in the children born to parents who’d taken it, however, the scandal caused a chilling effect on the study of pregnancy nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the story of how we finally got a scientific answer to why some pregnant people get sicker than others starts with a woman in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After geneticist Marlena Fejzo experienced a debilitating form of pregnancy nausea, called &lt;a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum"&gt;hyperemesis gravidarum&lt;/a&gt;, she found very little in the scientific literature attempting to explain why. Then an early career post-doc, Fejzo decided she would set out to find the answer herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pregnancy nausea was not Fejzo’s professional focus at the time she set out to study it, and she didn’t have funding to embark on any formal research, so she embarked on a bit of a DIY inquiry. She posted a survey online in the early days of the internet and received hundreds of replies via fax from people who’d experienced hyperemesis. Those gave her the first clues that the mechanism at play might be genetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the latest episode of the &lt;em&gt;Unexplainable&lt;/em&gt; podcast, I talk to Dr. Fejzo about her pregnancy and her path to finding a biological &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06921-9"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40173258/"&gt;cure&lt;/a&gt; to pregnancy nausea.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxq001x3b76icz7ukhi@published"&gt;“I like to say that AIDS is a terrible disease that you must take seriously,” Kimberly Bergalis said, her voice quavering. “I did nothing wrong, yet I’m being made to suffer like this. My life has been taken away. Please enact legislation so that no other patient or health care provider will have to go through the hell that I have. Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxq001y3b76pqj6q5ee@published"&gt;AIDS had already killed more than 100,000 Americans. A few months before that hearing, in June 1991, the &lt;a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/060391sci-aids.html"&gt;New York Times had marked&lt;/a&gt; a decade of the epidemic by recalling the brief 1981 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that described an outbreak of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in Los Angeles. The paper remembered an early optimism among researchers that the outbreak would be contained, limited to what the Times called “wildly promiscuous” gay men.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxr001z3b769afxr7g9@published"&gt;That faded quickly. The unimaginable spread of the disease and its death toll had since stunned the country and world. “10 Years of AIDS Battle: Hopes for Success Dim,” the Times’ headline read.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxr00203b76r6a04a1c@published"&gt;Though most of the dead were gay and bisexual men, by 1991 the face of the epidemic had become someone else entirely. Kimberly Bergalis was young, attractive, and, crucially, straight. Today few remember her name. But in the early ’90s, she was everywhere, a fixture in magazines and on the TV news, an unlikely victim devastated by a cruel disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxr00213b76wchk5aoz@published"&gt;The press and the public found her fascinating not just because of who she was and how she looked. They were also captivated, and terrified, by how she’d supposedly gotten HIV. Her account of it was scandalous and strange—almost unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxr00223b76j0qnk71d@published"&gt;In December 1987, when Bergalis was 19 years old, she went to a dentist in Jensen Beach, Florida, to get her bottom molars pulled. “She said that she remembered he wore gloves and a mask and she was awake the whole time,” a CDC investigator recently recalled to me. The whole thing seemed uneventful—but Bergalis told the investigator that she’d also heard a rumor that the dentist might have AIDS. Everything would snowball from there, grabbing America’s attention and creating a monumental controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxs00233b76hauv4cq2@published"&gt;It is hard to overstate the AIDS paranoia of the early 1990s, the intense fear and powerful stigma of the disease. Drug treatments were experimental, and little was known about how long they might keep people alive. And the people driving the spread were seen by many Americans as degenerates who couldn’t control themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxs00243b76d2stnakl@published"&gt;All these decades later, despite medical and social progress, the epidemic is far from over, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/magazine/americas-hidden-hiv-epidemic.html"&gt;even in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, and stigma against HIV-positive people persists. The new Trump administration’s cuts and policies &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/health/trump-hiv-cuts.html"&gt;seem certain to make things worse&lt;/a&gt;, if not &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/hiv-research-funding-cut"&gt;send us back in time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxs00253b763w33pkpv@published"&gt;Back in 1991, AIDS deaths were still soaring, with the peak of the American epidemic still four years away. And the story of Kimberly Bergalis was an irresistible flash point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxs00263b765nvdhj42@published"&gt;That’s largely because of who she believed had infected her. The man whom she accused would be turned into a national villain, without America ever knowing who he really was. Even now, Bergalis’ own story remains incredibly thorny. It’s a warning to a country that still hasn’t fully reckoned with the national disgrace of the AIDS epidemic. It’s also a parable about how we decide who’s guilty and who’s innocent—and about whose lives we ought to protect. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two hundred miles away from her strict Catholic parents, she soaked her hair in lemon juice to make it lighter and decorated her dorm room with a Pat Benatar poster. She made good grades in her business classes and dreamed of becoming an actuary.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002b3b76jlfzhog7@published"&gt;In the spring of 1989, a few months before she was scheduled to graduate, she got a job waiting tables. On her first day at work, she fainted. She got a sore throat. Antibiotics didn’t make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002c3b76qtrydrlm@published"&gt;By Christmas, she had gotten too weak to manage on her own. She moved back home to Florida’s Atlantic coast. Her parents often had to carry her around the house. Doctors checked her out for everything: diabetes, hepatitis, leukemia. Her mother, a public health nurse, suspected it might be something else.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002d3b76y8kxpo5o@published"&gt;Bergalis’ first HIV test wasn’t conclusive. The second came back positive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002e3b76jx4omr6k@published"&gt;She was in shock. She was 21 years old, at a time when an HIV diagnosis was basically &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/30/health/cnnphotos-hiv-aids-portraits/index.html"&gt;a death sentence&lt;/a&gt;. And she had no idea how she’d gotten infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002f3b76z0w95ian@published"&gt;In the early 1990s, state health departments asked the CDC for help when they couldn’t figure out how someone had gotten HIV. “She was very interested in talking to us to try to figure things out,” said Carol Ciesielski, a doctor who worked in the CDC’s AIDS surveillance branch at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002g3b76w2gfbgr5@published"&gt;HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, &lt;a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/hiv/conditioninfo/transmission"&gt;gets passed from person to person&lt;/a&gt; through blood and other bodily fluids, including semen. A few of the most common risk factors didn’t apply to Bergalis: She wasn’t an intravenous drug user. She’d never gotten a blood transfusion. As for sexual transmission—that was more of an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxt002h3b76c2mwaqt5@published"&gt;Bergalis said that she’d had some sexual contact but never intercourse. Ciesielski pressed her to describe exactly what she’d done. Bergalis said later that the questioning was pretty rough—that she had gotten asked, “When you were on a date with so-and-so, can you tell us what really happened on that date and, you know, where was his hand and where was your mouth?”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxu002i3b765qayhypn@published"&gt;Ciesielski acknowledged the awkwardness of these conversations. “I just felt sorry for her because, you know, it was so uncomfortable—you know, ‘I’m from the government, here to talk about your sex life,’ ” she told me. “But, I mean, they were very necessary questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxu002j3b766znyhvn1@published"&gt;Ciesielski could tell that Bergalis was embarrassed, but she answered the questions and gave the names of two boyfriends. When the CDC tracked them down, both tested negative for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxu002k3b76z2kn4i5l@published"&gt;That meant that sexual transmission was looking unlikely. But Ciesielski had one more avenue left to explore: Bergalis’ medical history. That’s when she brought up the dentist she’d seen a few years earlier to get her molars pulled. Bergalis had heard whispers that he might have AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxu002l3b76s6ul61t7@published"&gt;Even if that rumor about the dentist were true, it seemed like the longest of long shots that he’d given Bergalis HIV. As of 1990, there had never been a documented case in which an infected health care worker had transmitted the virus to a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxu002m3b767994c36u@published"&gt;Ciesielski was skeptical that this would be the first such case, but she couldn’t rule out the theory until she’d done more investigating. That meant dropping in on the dentist. His name was David Acer. He was 40 years old, and he lived in a brick-and-stucco home with a fenced-in backyard and a fishing boat in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

He was extremely thin and pale. Acer confirmed that the rumor was true: He did have AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002o3b76v459frd5@published"&gt;He told Ciesielski that he’d gotten tested outside town, to avoid the stigma that came with being HIV positive. He said that he was bisexual and believed he’d been infected by a sexual partner.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002p3b760rzki3vl@published"&gt;Acer had removed Bergalis’ molars three months after his initial diagnosis. While he had no legal obligation to reveal his HIV status to his patients, he said he always took precautions, including wearing gloves at a time when the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000039.htm"&gt;didn’t officially recommend&lt;/a&gt; them for dentists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002r3b76azgbvbbw@published"&gt;He had shut down his practice in the summer of 1989, after he became too sick to work. When patients asked about Acer, they were told he had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002s3b763w3etcpk@published"&gt;Now, in 1990, Ciesielski explained that she was investigating a case of AIDS in one of his former patients. For confidentiality reasons, she couldn’t say which patient she was talking about. But she told me that Acer was very compassionate and concerned about that person’s well-being. At the same time, he didn’t think it was possible that he could’ve transmitted HIV to anyone who’d sat in his dental chair. Ciesielski told him there was only one way to know for sure: to collect a sample of his blood and test it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002t3b76ommxvta4@published"&gt;Acer didn’t hesitate. He told Ciesielski to go ahead. “We sat at his kitchen table and I drew his blood, and then we went back to the health department, packed it up, and sent it off to Atlanta,” she remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002u3b76dzndpmed@published"&gt;The CDC had collected Bergalis’ blood too and sent off both samples for genetic testing. Today this sounds like the obvious next step. But at the time, it was a totally new concept—no one had ever done DNA analysis to figure out if one person had transmitted HIV to another.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxv002v3b7676j0d09k@published"&gt;Scientists in Georgia, New Mexico, and Scotland took up the challenge. And when their tests were done, they all reached the same conclusion: These two strains of HIV were a very close match.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw002w3b76135td5jo@published"&gt;Ciesielski and the rest of the CDC were feeling a lot less skeptical. They now believed that it was actually likely that Bergalis had been infected by her dentist. That meant they were looking at the first documented case of a health care worker transmitting HIV to a patient. And the implications were enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw002x3b763qroiplx@published"&gt;If there were even a slim chance of getting HIV during an ordinary dental procedure, that message would scare a lot of people. The fear of AIDS was already off the charts. So before the scientists said anything publicly, they thought hard about how confident they really were. “It was a big decision,” Ciesielski said, “because if it turns out it wasn’t true, we would be accused of fueling all the hysteria that resulted.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw002y3b76n6bs29f9@published"&gt;After weeks of debate, the CDC made its final decision in July 1990: The agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001679.htm"&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining what it knew about the dentist and his patient but added a note of caution. It said that “the possibility of another source of infection cannot be entirely excluded.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw002z3b76zztbung5@published"&gt;Not long after that article went out to the world, Bergalis was with her parents, watching the evening news. On NBC, Jane Pauley announced the lead story—that “for the first time, a patient was infected with the AIDS virus by her dentist.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw00303b76riqae0s5@published"&gt;There was no note of caution here: The national TV news was saying definitively that a patient &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; infected by her dentist. And while the CDC hadn’t identified Bergalis by name, it took her just a few seconds to figure out that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was that patient. “So it came out without her being told,” Ciesielski said. “It was horrible. It seems coldhearted.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw00313b767og89brh@published"&gt;The scientists at the CDC had struggled over whether to give Bergalis a heads-up. Ultimately, they decided that they couldn’t, because they had an obligation to protect Acer’s confidentiality. But Bergalis and her family felt outraged that they’d been kept in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxw00323b76ua1513uu@published"&gt;After the CDC released its report, health officials pleaded with Acer to go public so the people he’d treated would know they might be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxx00333b76ii97we9o@published"&gt;On Aug. 31, 1990, the same day he was transferred to hospice care, the dentist signed his name to a letter. It began: “To my former patients: I am David J. Acer, and I have AIDS.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxx00343b76x1dv8kmm@published"&gt;In the letter, Acer suggested that his patients “contact the local health department for free testing and counseling.” He also defended his character. The letter concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmcb1zpu5005u3b76g4bkkm5n@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="53"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a gentle man and I would have never intentionally exposed anyone to this disease. I have cared for people all my life, and to infect anyone with this disease would be contrary to everything I have stood for. I am sorry if the news story has caused you fear and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Acer died of AIDS on &lt;a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11662140/david-johnson-acer"&gt;Sept. 3, 1990&lt;/a&gt;, just three days after he’d signed that letter.&lt;/p&gt;

But it wouldn’t be for long. On Sept. 7, 1990, Kimberly Bergalis stood up at a news conference and said that she was the one the CDC had been talking about: the patient who’d gotten AIDS from her dentist.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxx00393b76qrsa4ybq@published"&gt;Bergalis said that she’d been totally healthy before she got her molars removed. Now she was gravely ill, overcome with a nearly constant fever and debilitating fatigue. But she told the media that she was on a mission. “If this can be prevented from happening to another family, then I think that’s what needs to be done,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxx003a3b76513s4v3f@published"&gt;In that room packed full of reporters, Bergalis sounded calm and composed. Her parents were far less measured. “If there’s a hell on Earth, we’re here now,” said her mother, Anna. Her father, George, said that Kimberly’s “only shortcoming was her faith in the health care agencies. They failed, and she paid the price.” The Bergalis family wasn’t just using their words to go after the people they thought were responsible. They also filed suit against Acer’s estate and his insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxy003b3b76zfx062uw@published"&gt;Before that press conference in September 1990, no one had any idea who Kimberly Bergalis was. Afterward, it seemed as if everyone in the country knew her name. She appeared on &lt;em&gt;CBS This Morning&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show, and she was on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110110164936/http:/www.people.com/people/archive/issue/0,,7566901022,00.html"&gt;the cover of People&lt;/a&gt;. A few months later, she told Oprah Winfrey about the emotional toll of her diagnosis. “I’m angry,” Bergalis said. “I think I shouldn’t be here. I should be out dating and with my friends.” She added: “This shouldn’t have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxy003c3b76va2qfysi@published"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110110195147/http:/www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113381,00.html"&gt;story in People&lt;/a&gt; said, “All who know her agree that Kimberly is the last person they would have thought might get AIDS.” Her father put it more bluntly. He said that his daughter’s “sickness would have been easier to accept if she’d been a slut or a drug user.”&lt;/p&gt;

She explained in a television documentary that despite her Catholic upbringing, her decisions around sex “weren’t a religious thing”—that she’d just “never really met” the “right person.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxy003e3b76ywpkd7v3@published"&gt;A lot of people weren’t buying it.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1990 Cheek was a young reporter at the Stuart News, a newspaper based out of Florida’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Coast"&gt;Treasure Coast&lt;/a&gt;. He was assigned to Bergalis’ story from the very first press conference. “My job was to get her to share with me the details of her life in a way so that I could poke holes in it,” he told me recently.&lt;/p&gt;

They did formal interviews at the beginning and end of that car ride, but for most of the trip they just chatted and got to know each other. “We talked about her life in college. We talked about what happened when she got sick. And I told her very early on I was gay,” Cheek said. He told me that Bergalis acknowledged that “her father was very homophobic. And she would actually say, ‘I’m not like my dad.’ ”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxy003h3b76emgt0wck@published"&gt;That day, Cheek asked Bergalis about her sex life. And by the time the car ride was over, his skepticism had melted away. “I found her absolutely genuine,” he said. “I don’t think she got it from any other person than the dentist.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxy003i3b76hokubeqg@published"&gt;Although that was Cheek’s journalistic hunch, the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association were still skeptical. Regardless of Bergalis’ sexual history, they thought the scientific evidence that she’d gotten HIV from her dentist was paltry and unproven.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxy003j3b76h9ucwqnu@published"&gt;But it wouldn’t be long before that theory started looking stronger. Because Bergalis wasn’t the only one of David Acer’s patients to get infected with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn’t just the carnival that was making Shoemaker miserable—she also hated the Florida weather and the bugs. And then, in the summer of ’88, everything got worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003m3b76dyhjpm4i@published"&gt;Shoemaker developed two abscessed teeth, one on each side. She went to see Acer. She said, “It looked like a good dental office, and it looked clean. People were friendly.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003n3b760l5ysba9@published"&gt;She got to know that office very well, going about 10 times. A few months after she started that regimen, Shoemaker discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her, with both men and women. So she decided to get tested. “They told me over the phone,” Shoemaker said: “&lt;em&gt;You are HIV positive&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003o3b76zvdkgcw0@published"&gt;She was devastated and confused. Because her boyfriend, strangely, was HIV negative. All she could think to do was move back to Michigan, where her parents lived, and try to get the care she needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003p3b760jz13y65@published"&gt;Two years later, in 1990, Shoemaker’s father told her about a news story he’d seen about a dentist who’d died of AIDS—and who’d possibly infected one of his patients. Shoemaker and her father contacted the CDC. “I wanted to know exactly how it happened,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003q3b76fycy3q6p@published"&gt;The CDC saw Shoemaker’s situation as very different from Bergalis’.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;While Bergalis didn’t have any obvious risk factors, Shoemaker did: her ex-boyfriend. And when the CDC asked him to get retested, this time he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; HIV positive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003r3b764k68ibev@published"&gt;That seemed like the answer Shoemaker had been looking for. But when the agency sent off a sample of her blood for genetic testing, it got a surprising result: The strain of the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in her blood was a close match to David Acer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003s3b763y80z1b6@published"&gt;Ultimately, the CDC would find six former patients who tested positive for HIV and whose strain closely matched Acer’s. It was looking even more likely that the dentist had infected a whole group of people who’d passed through his office.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003t3b76zoc15zi0@published"&gt;But the CDC still couldn’t explain how.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsxz003u3b76pdlpwuat@published"&gt;One theory was that a specific piece of equipment—a drill that Acer used on all the patients—&lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/07/13/AIDS-dentist-may-not-have-sterilized-drill-handpiece/6613679377600/"&gt;wasn’t properly sterilized&lt;/a&gt;. It was also possible that he accidentally jabbed himself, through his gloves, on a needle or a patient’s teeth. Maybe that could’ve even happened six different times, because he was tired or stressed or suffering from a tremor or numbness in his fingers. And then there was a more sinister possibility: that Acer had intentionally infected his patients.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy0003v3b76i1w81ld4@published"&gt;Although there wasn’t any good evidence to support that claim, the theory did get floated a lot. On ABC’s &lt;em&gt;20/20&lt;/em&gt;, Barbara Walters made Acer sound like a menacing gay villain, narrating darkly that while he “had what appeared to be a quiet and rather nondescript lifestyle, … what few people knew is that he drove to the gay bars in West Palm Beach, in Fort Lauderdale, where he could enjoy a completely different life he kept secret.”&lt;/p&gt;

And that was the story,” Barr said. “It made me angry that there would be so much media attention on &lt;em&gt;How did this person get HIV?&lt;/em&gt;, and much less attention paid to &lt;em&gt;How are we responding to this very large public-health crisis?&lt;/em&gt; That’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a bigger story to me than one infection in Florida.”&lt;/p&gt;

And he saw firsthand the toll that HIV and AIDS were taking on gay men. “The death was constant, and there was no time to really stop and take it all in—it was warlike,” he said. “But I think what made me most angry was just, there was virtually no response from the government. So it was really left to the community to sort of handle everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy1003z3b7672txfetk@published"&gt;Instead of being seen as victims in need of support, men like Acer were shunned as vectors of the disease and blamed for bringing AIDS on themselves through their behavior. In the letter he wrote to his patients before he died, the dentist had called himself a “gentle man.” Those words of self-defense were the only defense he’d get.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy100403b76n2v2f4w6@published"&gt;“No one wanted to be associated with David Acer,” Cheek, the reporter for the Stuart News in Florida, told me. “He was vilified in that community after Kimberly came forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

But after spending time with Bergalis, he saw the story through her eyes, not Acer’s. “And I’m sure it creeped into my writing,” Cheek said. “He was just this villain that had done something to this beautiful human being I’d met. And I even stopped calling him Dr. Acer or David Acer. I just called him Acer.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy100433b76yhi8n1a3@published"&gt;It all started at a shopping mall, when he bumped into someone he knew at the food court. “And he looks at me and he says, ‘I don’t like what you’re writing about David right now.’ I kind of had this confused look on my face, I’m sure. And I said, ‘David? Who’s David?’ And he said, ‘David Acer.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy100443b76wjc6rho9@published"&gt;This was someone who’d known David Acer personally. They were both part of a community of older closeted gay men in Stuart, Florida—a group that Cheek hadn’t known existed. There were no gay bars anywhere near Stuart, so these men met on Thursday nights at a local furniture store. They’d go in after closing hours to hang out and talk. It was the one place in town where Acer and his friends felt safe being themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy200453b76o8ywu6md@published"&gt;Cheek got an invitation to join them, and the group who met at that furniture store—six or seven men—all wanted to tell him about their friend David. How kind he was. How he sometimes wouldn’t charge them for dental work because he knew they couldn’t afford it. How, when one of their houses flooded, David was the first to show up at his door with a shop vac to help clean up.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy200463b762wv4ozgx@published"&gt;Now Cheek was seeing the story differently, through the dentist’s eyes. He wanted to write about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; David Acer—the pillar of his community, a man who was loved and mourned. But none of Acer’s friends were willing to be quoted and risk outing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy200473b76ihasjoqr@published"&gt;“I asked every one of them,” Cheek told me. “I went back to them multiple times.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy200483b76nql5mdjw@published"&gt;When I asked him if he thought it would’ve made a difference if he’d been able to publish that story, Cheek told me no—that “the world wanted to vilify gay men with AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the medication she was taking, her health was clearly declining. But she mustered the strength to keep on telling her story. On CBS’ &lt;em&gt;48 Hours&lt;/em&gt;, she said that health care workers had a responsibility to tell their patients if they had an infectious disease, “because it’s their life you’re playing with.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004a3b76tb1qu694@published"&gt;The Bergalis family had made that exact case in a civil lawsuit, claiming that Acer had had a responsibility to disclose that he had AIDS. That turned out to be a winning argument: They got a $1 million settlement from one insurance company and an undisclosed amount from another.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004b3b76ogumnv9m@published"&gt;But Bergalis didn’t have much use for money. She was dying. And she wanted to leave a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004c3b76dqcyxypp@published"&gt;Bergalis believed that she was proof that it should be mandatory for health care workers to get tested for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004d3b76m0as2659@published"&gt;She wasn’t alone in that opinion. Shoemaker, one of the other patients whose strain of HIV was a close match to Acer’s, agreed with her. “If you are infected or infectious to somebody, you want to watch it, make sure you’re not hurting someone else,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="22" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004e3b766wej0ikb@published"&gt;In 1991, amid a nationwide outcry over Bergalis’ case, it felt as if momentum were building—that mandatory testing might become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004f3b76gxsekqv7@published"&gt;Although&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a lot of Americans thought that sounded reasonable, AIDS activists like Barr were horrified. As an HIV-positive gay man, Barr believed that mandatory testing would make the epidemic worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy2004g3b76gfydcuqd@published"&gt;“There were a lot of health care workers who refused to touch people with HIV,” he said. “A lot of the health care workers who would work with people with AIDS were gay, so they were more likely to have HIV. So we were concerned that mandatory testing would only make it harder to get health care workers working on AIDS in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy3004h3b7619heyc54@published"&gt;This wasn’t just a theoretical concern: There were more than a dozen known cases in which an HIV-positive health care worker had lost their job after their status got revealed. That discrimination was motivated by fear, not science. Because when doctors and dentists practiced universal precautions—like wearing gloves and properly sterilizing their equipment—there was almost no risk of HIV transmission. “There were many, many people who had been treated by HIV-positive health care workers, and you weren’t seeing infections, so this was unnecessary,” Barr said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy3004i3b76xs7nz114@published"&gt;Bergalis had the potential to change that calculus. Her case showed that transmission &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; possible. “Yeah, that risk is small,” she said on &lt;em&gt;48 Hours&lt;/em&gt;, “but I’m the one that came down with it. It happens. And it took my life away.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy3004j3b76nblecer8@published"&gt;In that interview, which was broadcast in early 1991, Bergalis sounded like herself. But by the summer, she’d become incredibly frail. At this point, her strongest statement came in &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/20/Dying-AIDS-victim-sends-anguished-letter/7405677390400/"&gt;a letter released by her attorney&lt;/a&gt;. It was directed at the bureaucrats she believed had cast doubt on her story and the policymakers who hadn’t taken action to prevent other cases like hers. And it was incredibly angry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy3004k3b7664vsbzui@published"&gt;She wrote, “I blame Dr. Acer and every single one of you bastards. Anyone who knew Dr. Acer was infected and had full-blown AIDS and stood by not doing a damn thing about it.” The letter ended with this postscript: “If laws are not formed to provide protection, then my suffering and death was in vain. I’m dying guys. Good-bye.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy4004l3b76fkejouhq@published"&gt;In July 1991, Kimberly Bergalis’ words made it to the floor of the United States Senate, thanks to Jesse Helms. The North Carolina Republican read from Bergalis’ letter. He also claimed, contrary to all evidence, that gay doctors were infecting patients “everywhere” with HIV. Helms said, “We have sat on our hands and bowed to the homosexual lobby time and time again when this senator and others have stood on this floor pleading that something be done about these people who are responsible for the spread of AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;

Bergalis’ letter and the cause of mandatory testing also caught the attention of Rep. William Dannemeyer. The California Republican had &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/shadowinlandhomo00dann"&gt;written an entire book&lt;/a&gt; about what he saw as the threat of homosexuality. And in 1991, he’d become the Bergalises’ biggest political ally. Dannemeyer sponsored a bill to mandate HIV testing and disclosure for health care workers. He called it the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/2788"&gt;Kimberly Bergalis Act&lt;/a&gt; and asked Bergalis herself to testify before Congress. Despite her failing health, her family accepted the invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy4004n3b76fx83nok6@published"&gt;Bergalis traveled from Florida by train, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/09/26/kimberly-bergaliss-ride-of-rage/8f1b197d-a3d5-4fdf-a2f4-4489f4a21716/"&gt;reporters tagged along&lt;/a&gt; to document the trip. At the Amtrak station, her legs were too feeble to bear her own weight, so her parents held her up between them.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She spoke for just 21 seconds, asking for Congress to “please enact legislation so that no other patient or health care provider will have to go through the hell that I have.” Her father spoke next, for significantly longer than his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

He asked: “Does that type of logic mean if Adolf Hitler had been responsible for only a handful of Jewish deaths, it would have been acceptable?”&lt;/p&gt;

When it was his turn to speak, he said, “No other case of AIDS has received more attention than that of Kimberly Bergalis.” He told the politicians that he and Bergalis actually had a lot in common: They were both young and spoke their minds and had family and friends that cared for them. Then he talked about something else they shared: their anger.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like you, I feel that I do not deserve this fate. Although we may have acquired this virus in different ways, I have never asked for this. And neither did over 115,000 Americans who have already died. I am angry that our government will criminalize health care workers instead of allowing them to do their jobs. They will test patients instead of providing care. They will collect names instead of providing treatments that could save our lives. Yours and mine, Kimberly. Here we are, together at this circus, being pitted against each other. Do not allow your case to be used as a means to draw attention away from the real threat that we as individuals and as a nation face from AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She was 23 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

But the Kimberly Bergalis Act, which faced enormous opposition from medical groups and AIDS activists, never made it out of committee.&lt;/p&gt;

(Today that recommendation &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/management-of-healthcare-personnel-living-with-hepatitis-b-hepatitis-c-or-human-immunodeficiency-virus-in-us-healthcare-institutions/71C331662FBEDDF7F62369E22A22E4F0"&gt;is no longer in effect&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll likely never know with absolute certainty whether Acer transmitted HIV to Bergalis and five other patients. But more than 30 years later, there’s no alternative theory that holds up to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

If he did infect those six people, the CDC never could figure out how.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy600503b764c7594e9@published"&gt;Four of the six patients whose strain of HIV matched David Acer’s &lt;a href="https://archive.tcpalm.com/news/columnists/eve-samples-mysterious-ad-triggers-memories-of-dentist-with-aids-ep-381981562-342996752.html"&gt;died of AIDS within just a few years&lt;/a&gt;. Lisa Shoemaker is one of two who are still alive. When we spoke in 2023, Shoemaker told me she didn’t believe that Acer had ever meant to hurt anyone. “When you get into the health arena, you’re there to help people, not to harm them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

She also served on the board of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS for four years. “A lot of the men that I got to be friends with would just pass away, and I wouldn’t even find out until I’d got to the meetings,” she said. “It was hard, because you’re still here.”&lt;/p&gt;

Antiretroviral therapy, &lt;a href="https://www.thebody.com/article/25th-anniversary-hiv-treatment-revolution-1996"&gt;pioneered in the mid-’90s&lt;/a&gt;, has extended lifespans far beyond what seemed possible at the height of the epidemic. But Barr refuses to get complacent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcb1wsy700533b76st7mj0yx@published"&gt;There are still &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/the-hivaids-epidemic-in-the-united-states-the-basics/"&gt;more than 30,000&lt;/a&gt; new HIV infections in the United States every year, mostly among Black and Latino gay men who have no access to HIV services. “There’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;no reason other than willful neglect,” Barr said. “Everything I said to Kimberly about the things I’m angry about is as true today as it was then.&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;s&gt;&lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, overall heart disease death rates over the past five decades dropped by 66% in American adults age 25 and older, according to a new study. Even better, deaths from heart attacks dropped by nearly 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Over the past 50 years, our understanding of heart disease, what causes it and how we treat it has evolved considerably,” said lead study author Dr. Sara King, a second-year internal medicine resident at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There have been great strides made in helping people survive initial acute cardiac events that were once considered a death sentence,” King said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, that positive news has a flip side. Deaths from all other types of heart disease, including &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:arrhythmia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;arrhythmia&lt;/a&gt;, heart failure and hypertensive heart disease increased by 81% in the United States, according to the study &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published Wednesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to put both sets of numbers into perspective, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These days, the likelihood of dying from a heart attack is relatively low compared to where it’s been, but the likelihood of significant disability from the heart attack is still high,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You might develop heart failure — where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs and you’re always short of breath,” he said. “Or maybe you’re on a number of medications for blood pressure, fluid retention and cholesterol, or you never feel your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s one thing to be alive, it’s another to be alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Cardiovascular risks on the rise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study analyzed government data on deaths from heart disease between 1970 and 2022. Back in 1970, heart attacks were responsible for 54% of all deaths from heart issues. By 2022 that number had dropped to 29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Deaths from atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, which happen when electrical impulses to the heart go awry and cause an irregular heartbeat or “flutter” in the chest, were rare in the 1970s. By 2022, the number had risen to 450% — about 4% of all heart disease deaths, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Deaths from heart failure increased 146% over the same time period, while death due to persistent high blood pressure rose by 106%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in cardiovascular risk factors are contributing to the rise in certain types of heart disease, the study said. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices and physical inactivity have skyrocketed over the past 50 years. Obesity prevalence rose from 15% in 1970 to 40% in 2022, the study found. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes now impacts nearly half of all adults in the United States. High blood pressure increased from 30% in 1978 to nearly 50% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another potential contributor — the aging Baby Boomer population now reaching a time when they are most likely to develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“All of these risk factors contribute to an ongoing burden of heart disease, especially as related to heart failure, hypertensive heart disease and arrhythmias,” said senior study author Dr. Latha Palaniappan, professor of cardiovascular medicine and associate dean for research at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Heart disease hasn’t gone away,” Palaniappan said in a statement. “The focus now must be on helping people age with strong, healthy hearts by preventing events, and prevention can start as early as childhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The US was the biggest funder of global HIV initiatives until the start of Donald Trump's second term as president&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Experts told DW cuts to domestic health institutions and foreign aid are likely to jeopardize efforts to stop an increase in HIV infections&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They said the risk was real despite lencapavir, a highly promising, preventative drug that's now approved in the US for HIV prevention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle against HIV has been dealt repeated blows in 2025 with cuts to funding for &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/us-officially-cancelling-83-of-usaid-programs-rubio-says/a-71879861"&gt;major global aid programs&lt;/a&gt; by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been budget cuts closer to home. And experts have told DW the cuts risk undermining efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US by 2030, even now, with the approval of lenacapavir — what UNAIDS officials have described as a "miracle" drug — in HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lencapavir provides six months of protection against &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-aids/t-18932088"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; infection. The renowned journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; named it 2024's scientific "breakthrough of the year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts are asking whether the promise of the drug could be undone by the defunding of US public health agencies that are vital for getting lencapavir to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Are we going to squander this, probably the greatest opportunity in 44 years of HIV prevention both in the US and globally?" asked Mitchell Warren, executive director of the nonpartisan HIV organization AVAC, in an interview with DW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What makes lenacapavir a 'miracle' drug?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency that addresses HIV and AIDS around the world, dubbed lenacapavir a "miracle product" in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was hype, it was well-founded hype. In late-stage clinical trials, lenacapavir had a near-perfect record of suppressing HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having already approved it as a treatment to reduce viral load in patients with the disease, the US Food and Drug Administration has now confirmed lenacapavir as a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/5-things-to-know-about-the-hiv-prevention-drug-prep/a-47384491"&gt;pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug&lt;/a&gt;. PrEP drugs are taken before having &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/t-64645822"&gt;unprotected sex&lt;/a&gt; or injecting drugs to protect against HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other PrEP drugs, which aim to disrupt the virus at one stage of its life cycle, lencapavir has been shown to attack HIV at several stages, increasing its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 400,000 US patients use some form of PrEP, usually a daily pill. But a twice-a-year injection with lenacapavir would provide people with the longest-lasting protection yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'Knock-on effects are huge'&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first term, US President &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/donald-trump/t-19434433"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; started an "Ending the HIV Epidemic" (EHE) initiative, an effort to stop the transmission of the disease within the US by the end of this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the current Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has downsized the federal health budget, affecting key public health agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and programs including Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America's global aid initiatives, including USAID and PEPFAR (the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), have also been substantially wound back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's the NIH research infrastructure [or] USAID for foreign assistance, these are big programs and none of them are HIV specific," Warren said. "But each one of them is diminished now in [its ability] to deliver the comprehensive and integrated programs that have been really at the forefront [of HIV response]."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this lost funding, Warren said, is that especially vulnerable groups, such as those from low-income backgrounds, gay and bisexual men and sex workers, may not benefit from the new PrEP drug, lenacapavir, which could provide them with unprecedented protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Crowley, director of the Center for HIV and Infectious Disease Policy at the O'Neill Institute in Washington, said services like expanded Medicaid coverage have meant better access to HIV programs for those with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an incredible accomplishment, and it's helped drive a lot of the progress we've seen," Crowley told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said the cuts will mean people lose access to HIV services, which other programs can't cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think the American people can be proud of how we responded to the HIV crisis domestically and globally, but this is all at risk. We've come so far, after so much death, why would we take a step backward?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global impact to be felt soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, more than a million new HIV cases are reported globally and, until recently, US support through programs like USAID and PEPFAR was essential in helping regions most affected by the disease, &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/south-africa-usaid-cuts-could-prompt-over-500000-hiv-deaths/a-71777420"&gt;especially countries in Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Trump administration's aid withdrawal has already had an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from UNAIDS suggests there will be 2,300 more HIV cases per year because of the cuts to PEPFAR alone. Annual infections to date were already at about 3,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Less funding means we will get more and more off track," said Byanyima in mid-June. "We don't know what the total impact [of the US cuts] will be, but impact there will be. Already, you see in several countries a drop in the number of people going to clinics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government continues to support pregnant women and new mothers via PEPFAR, but the changes have stopped access to PrEP for gay and bisexual men, sex workers and drug users — groups that are disproportionately affected by HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren said it was akin to "throwing out a whole generation" of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Keep a pain diary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thoughts that trigger or increase back pain vary by person, as do the emotions they provoke. Research suggests that ruminating on your back pain – thinking about it over and over again – can make it feel &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10069845/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;both more intense and more life-limiting&lt;/a&gt;. Writing them down can help process that and put an end to rumination.“Try jotting down the negative thoughts you have and getting into a conversation with them, about what you can do to better look after yourself in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;2. Work on accepting that back pain is part of your life for now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the worst elements of back pain is its continuous presence in our lives, no matter what we do. It’s normal to feel anxious, down or angry because of it. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/what-stress-does-body-how-avoid-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Depression and anxiety can both cause a predisposition to and worsen back pain&lt;/a&gt;. “Research shows that in men, anger is closely related to back pain. Struggling to manage anger can both cause and worsen pain because it leads to increased muscle tension, but of course, the pain makes many men angrier too,” says Martinelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the pain you suffer, it’s important to accept the position you’re in, says Martinelli, however bad it may be. “Notice the struggle and name it,” says Martinelli. “When you feel yourself fighting the pain, say “this is me struggling”. That small act of awareness can shift how you respond.” It can also be helpful to use metaphors to change the relationship that you have with the pain (see the three specific suggestions from Martinelli below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things may well change for the better in the future, “but in the moment, it’s important to accept how you feel and not try to change it or run away from it. This only makes the pain worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;3. Getting outside can be a powerful distraction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t underestimate the power of connecting with nature,” says Martinelli. It might sound woo-woo but there’s science to support the proposition that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/why-princess-of-wales-using-great-outdoors-to-heal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the great outdoors can boost wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; and bring you into the present, distracting you from worries about the future and reducing pain. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10538778/#:~:text=The%20literature%20suggests%20that%20the,the%20management%20of%20chronic%20pain." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Multiple studies&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that exposure to green space reduces pain and improves quality of life in people suffering with chronic pain conditions, including back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even watching nature scenes on a screen can relieve pain, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/watching-nature-scenes-can-reduce-pain-new-study-shows/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research suggests.&lt;/a&gt; A recent neuroimaging study from the University of Vienna and the University of Exeter, showed that nature helps because “the brain is reacting less to information about where the pain is coming from and how intense it feels”, said Max Steininger, who led the study. “So try to make five minutes to get out for a quick walk around the park when you can,” says Martinelli. “Over time, doing this regularly will help to reduce the pain you feel in your everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;4. Pay attention to when you’re worrying about the pain – and stretch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pain arises, we often respond by turning on a mental “struggle switch” – resisting, fighting or trying to push the pain away. This response tends to make things worse by layering frustration, fear and tension on top of the pain. When we learn to notice this instinct and gently turn the switch off, the pain might still be present, but we’re no longer adding emotional suffering to it. This shift makes space for calm, choice and greater self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back pain is “a signal from the body that something has gone wrong in how we’re treating it”, says Martinelli. Those of us who work at desks are used to hearing that we should get up and stretch every half an hour, and go for a quick walk every hour or so, but few of us actually do. Part of the work of mindfulness and CBT is to show patients &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/daily-habits-how-to-get-rid-of-back-pain-treat-prevent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;how important it is to take a minute for this kind of self-care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is best practised when you have negative thoughts about your pain and the future, Martinelli says. Instead of becoming distracted by them, “take that time to stretch, as when you’re having negative thoughts, your body tenses up, and having a quick stretch will relieve that and get your mind back into the present moment”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. Schedule deep breathing into your day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easier than you might think to practice mindfulness and feel the benefits: just five minutes of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/how-to-breathe-anxiety-technique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, practised three times a day, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.ons.org/publications-research/cjon/25/2/mindful-breathing-effects-five-minute-practice-perceived-stress-and" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;can be enough to relieve pain&lt;/a&gt;. Combining this with having your morning coffee or tea can be a great way to build the habit, says Martinelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Start your day with a hot drink and pay attention to all the things you like about it and how calm you feel before your day starts up,” Martinelli recommends. “This sets a positive intention for the day and gives you space from negative thoughts that might be aggravating your pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to use CBT to break out of negative thought patterns and relieve pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mabel Martinelli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with chronic back pain often develop certain beliefs or thought patterns about their pain – for instance, that it will inevitably get worse and continue to limit what they can do. These thoughts can become automatic and powerful, increasing distress and making the pain feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where CBT comes in: it helps people to notice these thoughts, challenge unhelpful patterns, and develop more flexible ways of thinking. There are three metaphors I use often to help people relate to their pain in a new way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think about pain as quicksand: the more we struggle against it, the more stuck we feel. But when we stop fighting, we can find ways to float.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imagine the ocean and the surfer: pain is like the waves – we can’t stop them, but we can learn to surf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See pain as a heavy backpack: pain is a burden, but carrying it while still walking toward what matters is possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you regularly experience pain or recurring injuries in the hips or knees, even though you stretch and do strength training, you may feel like throwing in the towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to physical therapist Sanjit Kooner, there’s one set of muscles people with injuries in these areas of the body often neglect. They’re known as the hip stabilizers, which play an important role in proper hip movement and stability. If these muscles aren’t functioning well, it can have a trickle-down effect on your knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner has shared his favourite exercise for strengthening these muscles to help prevent hip and knee injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a deceptively simple yet highly effective glute and hip stabilizer drill,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I first learned this drill from a sport physiotherapy specialist, and I was skeptical until I felt how effectively it targeted the stabilizers we often miss in traditional training.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-hip-and-knee-stability-drill"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the hip and knee stability drill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kooner demonstrates the move with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Ffoam-roller-exercise-roller%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3407871%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-1174522568072241681-20" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/foam-roller-exercise-roller/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=3407871" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Ffoam-roller-exercise-roller%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3407871%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;foam roller&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Frh%3Dn%253A17388462011%26language%3Den_US%26brr%3D1%26rd%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-9913253755448986805-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A17388462011&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;brr=1&amp;amp;rd=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Frh%3Dn%253A17388462011%26language%3Den_US%26brr%3D1%26rd%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;Pilates ball&lt;/a&gt; or even a small sports ball is preferable. “I recommend doing it with a small ball against the wall rather than a foam roller for better control and feedback,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you may pay more attention to your leg pressing against the foam roller or ball because it’s an unfamiliar position, it’s your standing leg that will be doing most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-np7Eo8C85UbXchBhgQH8Bk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-np7Eo8C85UbXchBhgQH8Bk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with traditional single-leg squats, you don’t necessarily need a full range of motion here. “You don’t need to squat deep to get the benefits,” says Kooner. “In fact, partial range squats are often more relevant and functional in athletic settings. The goal is to maintain control, tension and alignment rather than chase depth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner recommends completing two sets of 10 to 12 reps on each leg, aiming to do this two to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-this-drill"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of this drill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll feel a deep burn through the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;gluteus medius&lt;/a&gt; and other hip stabilizers, which are crucial for balance, injury prevention and efficient movement in sport,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move will also help you improve balance and coordination, so you can move well in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

The disease is rare and thought to only affect those with compromised immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, a combination of Covid infection, poorly-managed diabetes and an over-use of steroids to control lung inflammation from Covid led to a spike in infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2021, there was an epidemic in India, with 40,000 cases leading to 3,500 deaths. Many of the survivors were left with facial disfigurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Although still at prototype stage, a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology has shown the new test to be swift and accurate in identifying the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Professor Chris Thornton, who is developing a novel later flow test for Black Fungus Disease&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Thornton, co-author of the study, said: "Mucormycosis is an horrific disease, which spreads rapidly in the body and can leave people horribly facially disfigured, and is often fatal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Early diagnosis is crucial for the best outcome.
