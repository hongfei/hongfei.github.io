For people with weak immune systems, this can lead to organ failure and even death. People with cancer, asthma, or HIV are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists say the fungus is spreading in parts of the US, especially in warm, wet states like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, and California.

That makes it hard to know how many people are getting sick or dying from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;People with weak immunity should avoid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say people with weak immune systems should avoid soil, gardening, and mold. They should wear masks in dusty areas and keep the air clean in their homes and hospitals. US hospitals are doing more mold checks and using stronger antifungal drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Aspergillus fungus also makes a poison called aflatoxin. This can cause cancer and damage to the lungs, liver, stomach, spleen, colon, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also Read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/what-is-fusarium-graminearum-the-fungus-us-authorities-say-was-smuggled-in-from-china-101749061874670.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="What is Fusarium graminearum, the fungus that 2 Chinese nationals allegedly used to target US food security?"&gt;What is Fusarium graminearum, the fungus that 2 Chinese nationals allegedly used to target US food security?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A scientist from the University of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/manchester-city" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Manchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; said that this fungus could change where plants grow and what infections people get in the next 50 years. He said hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 400,000 people develop a long-term lung infection called chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. A more dangerous form, called invasive aspergillosis, is less common but often deadly. It mainly affects people with weak immune systems and can spread to the brain, heart, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One study showed that only 59% of organ transplant patients lived for one year after getting invasive aspergillosis. Only 25% of stem cell transplant patients survived that long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2013, US hospital stays for invasive aspergillosis went up about 3% each year. By 2014, there were almost 15,000 hospital stays, costing around $1.2 billion. Autopsies in ICUs show aspergillosis is one of the top four infections that can cause death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus, an alarming threat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/world-health-organization" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="World Health Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says Aspergillus fumigatus is a top-priority fungal threat because it is becoming more resistant to drugs and kills so many people. The fungus grows well in warm, damp places. It can even survive in compost piles over 120°F.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of climate change, the human body is becoming a better place for this fungus to grow. A new study from the University of Manchester says if we keep using fossil fuels like we are now, the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fungus" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fungus"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; could spread 75% more by 2100. This would put millions more people at risk, especially in the southern U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drugs called azoles are often used to treat fungal infections in people, but they are also used a lot in farming to protect crops. Experts say using these drugs too much on farms may be making the fungus resistant. That means the drugs don’t work anymore, even in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study found azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in farm soil in at least seven US states. Many of these fungi are already resistant to regular antifungal drugs. Scientists say mixing of different fungus types is making the problem worse, and it’s already a big issue in US soil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;WHO asks for swift action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization is calling for fast action, better drugs, quicker tests, and more training for doctors and nurses. They also want drug companies to focus more on fungal diseases and test new treatments on children too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:55:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxONmpMV2k1LWNRQ3hiMXI0TmY2NXg5aU9xZXIwX0JNWjVyZVBnelVNOWpxWS1hc1hnMGdXdDJRSmRDSjRkQkllLVl2RHF5aDYyS0h5U0d3dkdHMWs4QzJJUmdzNGdPT25JX3JSd2ZCOXk1LXBDUUNOUk05eGFrTVRJeHFaR2RsMnR1NTYzblZLY0FiOFpSNnlBeWpiM2JybHRoLWljOFRfRjJwbWFxaWl3aTNWNExEaHV3QUc0TDI5b1BwMWh1VXhqN2ZQZ09kR3pvRTYwM3ZicnFDdG9ROTdqOGRydU5PWGZfUjE1MXdDS3XSAfYBQVVfeXFMT0tyR0NlMEZmQXh5SmZKb3BQUjljQWpqRWU5NTBxV0pvSEtlb0RSSDlTVGJPS3JxZm9Vc2hrUXk5YkgzVktBR2FSZE5jaGlwR25KUlNvUXZOU0ZhVDdBMlA3aE5hZ0hyZzh5SzZmUTA5LVFjaDNTM2llWGFkUjlCdnlsWU1vU1Z1Vml6Y3pOUUgxbDJnSlE0dmkzNGRYS2p4SVJLVXVTM3pEZHhqMWpIaGlHSmd5d1Z0TUd0QlZVaEZoeHNtblpzY2ppbWVZYzZnRkFCQk5mcEppMWpmOE9UQ3Q5TmNDSzZ5SjRHU250emZQOVE0blRR</guid></item><item><title>杜勒斯国际机场爆发疫情的担忧引发警报-每日邮报 | Outbreak fears at Dulles International Airport as passenger with world's most infectious disease triggers alert - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNQkxYZ0ViVzY1UUlYSXVXR0JfZXhmdDRUakNTM016NWxhbFVYeU9Ma1JlYlVscWdqTW41NmZyWERya19jQ2FMMXRJY2FCOFpvQUtySE52eGpYZzh2aXNNbzdPX2t3bktoZnJHOWRsV2ZYTzAzd191X2g4ejNJcXVIdkp3Tmxqbm5HczMtR0J6dXcwNnFLeUxjSzF5NWtuWUcyMnfSAacBQVVfeXFMUDVkRGRXM1B1NjR5MTVfRVVtMDJXcnI1dEpQWmYzd2FYQkxsRnBrZzZzbWZ1OXRnTzBNcEQ3QU9yOGhWR2VEdGJ5UER4RDNYc0FUVjZwbjk5VklWcEk1VkV4aEZqVWlHREhFdVVKUGlGeG5OdHhNTFpiUHNZejYtTGFLZW9oeEFjNnM3T3NIeWNlM0I4X2FUcmhqckJMZmlDWkZMSnlzYms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Washington Dulles International Airport in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-fd12f6b0-fdae-11ef-a395-174b654ad242"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A passenger arriving on an international flight tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness, which is currently &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473199/texas-measles-outbreak-doctor-cases.html"&gt;ripping through the US.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Travelers who were at the airport, which serves the Washington, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-f5e547c0-4ab7-11f0-80ee-adf09d27bf09"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-be0303d0-4ab5-11f0-80ee-adf09d27bf09"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; region, on June 8 have been warned they could be at high risk of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infected traveler passed through Concourse A, took airport transportation to the International Arrivals Building (IAB), then visited the baggage claim area between 10:30am and 1pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, they took public transportation in the area on the same day, traveling on the Washington Metro Silver Line train from the Dulles International Airport station to the Red Line, heading towards Shady Grove station between 11:30am and 2:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14455647/Second-major-US-airport-red-alert-measles-jfk.html"&gt;Travelers who fear&lt;/a&gt; they may have been exposed are advised to confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To date in 2025, Virginia has three reported cases of measles, with another one of these cases also linked to a traveler at Washington Dulles International Airport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new case comes as Texas is battling a measles outbreak that has infected nearly 800 people and killed two children - and experts warn the US is vulnerable to even more measles outbreaks because of falling vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this time, 744 cases have been confirmed in the Lone Star state since late January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-six of the patients have been hospitalized and there &lt;span&gt;have been two fatalities in unvaccinated school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, in the US there have been 1,168 confirmed measles cases reported by 34 states and at least three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the world's most contagious disease - infecting nine out of 10 people exposed - but those who are fully vaccinated are protected in 97 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and a high fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If severe, it can lead to life-threatening pneumonia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children need two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine: the first at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to three in 1,000 people with measles dies of the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html" class=""&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html" class=""&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is below the 95 percent needed to prevent the disease from spreading and causing deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:23:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNQkxYZ0ViVzY1UUlYSXVXR0JfZXhmdDRUakNTM016NWxhbFVYeU9Ma1JlYlVscWdqTW41NmZyWERya19jQ2FMMXRJY2FCOFpvQUtySE52eGpYZzh2aXNNbzdPX2t3bktoZnJHOWRsV2ZYTzAzd191X2g4ejNJcXVIdkp3Tmxqbm5HczMtR0J6dXcwNnFLeUxjSzF5NWtuWUcyMnfSAacBQVVfeXFMUDVkRGRXM1B1NjR5MTVfRVVtMDJXcnI1dEpQWmYzd2FYQkxsRnBrZzZzbWZ1OXRnTzBNcEQ3QU9yOGhWR2VEdGJ5UER4RDNYc0FUVjZwbjk5VklWcEk1VkV4aEZqVWlHREhFdVVKUGlGeG5OdHhNTFpiUHNZejYtTGFLZW9oeEFjNnM3T3NIeWNlM0I4X2FUcmhqckJMZmlDWkZMSnlzYms</guid></item><item><title>我用我最喜欢的健身追踪器追踪了我的血糖水平。这3个要点让我感到惊讶- CNET | I Tracked My Glucose Levels With My Favorite Fitness Tracker.

The goal of this collaboration is to help everyday people like me understand how food and general eating habits &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;impact blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"By combining Stelo data with Oura's existing insights, we're empowering members to better understand the cause-and-effect relationships between eating patterns, energy, mood and recovery -- and ultimately make sustainable, science-backed lifestyle changes," Maz Brumand, vice president of product for Oura, told CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've used my &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oura-ring-4-review-my-favorite-wellness-tracker-comes-with-a-pricey-caveat/" target="_self"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt; daily for the past three years to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-sleep-tracker/" target="_self"&gt;track my sleep&lt;/a&gt;, recovery and stress. But it was the first time I heard that a fitness tracker can monitor blood sugar levels. I tested the Stelo CGM with my Oura Ring for two weeks, and I can say that it changed the way I eat and move, and I think this type of biofeedback is helpful for everyone, even if you do not have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is continuous glucose monitoring, and why is it important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the measurement of sugar in your blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23509-glycogen" target="_self"&gt;glucose is the main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for your body -- it's what powers your muscles, brain and even your cells. When you eat certain foods (particularly carbohydrates), your glucose rises, and your body responds by releasing insulin to shuttle that sugar into cells for energy or storage. On the flip side, if you experience frequent spikes or crashes (even if you don't have diabetes ), it can impact your energy, sleep, mood and even long-term metabolic health. When your body doesn't need glucose immediately, it &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539802/" target="_self"&gt;stores it as glycogen&lt;/a&gt; in your muscles and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, monitoring glucose levels is crucial. But is it important to do the same for the rest of us without a diagnosis? To an extent, I think so. Monitoring your blood sugar throughout the day and seeing how your body reacts to different foods can reveal a lot about your cravings, sleep and metabolic health. "Glucose is a real-time window into metabolic health, which underpins how we feel day to day -- our energy, focus, mood and sleep -- and how resilient we are over time," Brumand says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of wearable glucose sensors like Stelo, those without diabetes can now get insights into how their eating habits impact their bodies (without finger pricks or a prescription).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a 'normal' glucose range, and are spikes bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using a CGM, I thought blood sugar was either stable or erratic, with no room for in-between spikes. Once I began tracking my glucose daily, I quickly learned that spikes are completely normal, especially after meals and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will see glucose levels rise and drop throughout the day. According to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, a general target range for adults without pre-diabetes or diabetes is between &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;70 and 140mg/dL&lt;/a&gt; (note that Oura also follows this range, and it's what users can expect to see in their graphs). It's also worth highlighting that 70 to 100mg/dL is considered normal for fasting (particularly in the morning before having food), and under 140 mg/dL is common, especially after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical studies show that even in healthy individuals, a moderate glucose spike (rise above 140mg/dL) can occur on a daily basis. In fact, research suggests that healthy adults will live above 140mg/dL for about 30 minutes, up to 2 hours a day, which is usually 1 to 3 short-lived glucose spikes", says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneefitton" target="_self"&gt;Renee Fitton&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and director of education at &lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/l-nutra/org-chart/renee-fitton-ms-rd" target="_self"&gt;L-Nutra&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that the number and frequency of glucose spikes depend on various factors, primarily what and when you're eating. These spiked can also be affected by other factors like stress level, exercise, dehydration and even whether you have a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many glucose monitors use a custom range that adapts to your body's baseline and patterns over time. When looking at your graph, it's important to keep in mind that context and trends matter more than one-off spikes. For example, seeing a spike after dessert isn't a sign that something is wrong. It's a sign that your body is doing its job. What matters most is how quickly your glucose returns to baseline and how often your levels stay elevated over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not see signs for concern for occasional (one to three times per day) moderate spikes (less than 160mg/dL) that resolve within about 30 mins. When reaching more frequent, especially if they are higher spikes (for example, above 180mg/dL), that take a long time to resolve (over 60 minutes), then there may be concerns about metabolic health," Fitton explained. "A completely flat glucose curve is not something that we aim for; you want some gentle ups and downs as a sign of healthy metabolic flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I set up the Stelo monitor with my Oura Ring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order the Stelo sensor through &lt;a href="http://ouraring.com" target="_self"&gt;ouraring.com&lt;/a&gt; ($99 for two sensors). I received a small box with the sensors and easy instructions. Applying it to the back of my upper arm took less than 2 minutes and was surprisingly painless. And yes, there is a small needle involved. I'm terrified of needles, so I spent some time mentally preparing to prick myself, but to my disbelief, I didn't feel it at all. The sound the ejector makes is pretty loud, though. I sometimes think the sound acted as a diversion to my brain, and that's why I didn't feel anything. But, nonetheless, it was a pretty pain-free experience. Once in place, I paired it to the Stelo app, and it automatically reflected within the Oura app. Each sensor tracks your glucose level 24/7 for up to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left Image: CGM in the self-injector.

You can easily access it at the top of the app, where you also see other data metrics like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-chest-strap-heart-rate-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, activity and readiness score (a personalized score, ranging from 0 to 100, that provides a snapshot of how well your body has recovered from the previous day's activities and sleep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How even my 'healthy' food choices raised my blood sugar (and that's OK)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eye-opening parts of my testing was seeing how some of my favorite healthy staples played out on the glucose graph. A great example of this was my favorite pressed juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a pressed juice in the morning that contained pineapple, beets, carrots, ginger, cucumber and lemon. It's nutrient-dense, but it also spiked my glucose above what's considered my healthy range for about 6  minutes (a small window and still considered optimal for my age and overall metabolic health). This was enough to make me rethink how and when I consume fruit-heavy beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I experimented with having a fruit smoothie instead of juice. I made a homemade smoothie with berries, banana, plant-based protein powder, peanut butter, soy milk and oats. This smoothie kept my glucose completely in range (zero minutes above my personal threshold). The added protein and fiber from the fruit, oatmeal, peanut butter and protein powder helped slow the absorption of natural sugars into my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I learned: Even natural fruit juices can cause glucose spikes, especially when consumed on an empty stomach and without any protein or fiber. Smoothies that include protein, fat and fiber can help keep spikes at bay and help stabilize your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance your meals with protein, fats and fiber &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that week, I had sushi rolls with a side of edamame for dinner. To my surprise, my glucose levels stayed within range the whole time. Oura Advisor (Oura's AI coach) even pointed out that this food combination offered protein and fiber, which likely contributed to the steady glucose levels. This moment was really encouraging for me. It made me realize that I don't need to drastically change what I eat. By just being more intentional about how I pair my foods, I can drastically improve the impact they have on my blood glucose. Pairing your foods with healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil can also slow digestion and therefore the absorption of sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton explains that this is primarily due to what happens in our digestive tract, even before the nutrients get to our bloodstream. Protein, fiber and healthy fats work in their own way to slow the absorption of simple carbohydrates into the bloodstream, making a slower, more gradual release of sugars into the blood. These factors turn what could be a glucose spike into a steady rise that your body can clear gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest area of concern when managing our blood sugar levels is limiting refined carbohydrates. When you do choose a refined-carb item (a plain cracker, white flour tortilla, cookies, etc.), try to pair it instead of eating it solo: add cheese, nut butter or a handful of edamame to blunt the glucose rise, and choose a higher-fiber version of your carbohydrate source when possible (for example, whole-grain crackers) so the carbs come packaged with their own speed limit," Fitton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cake and a walk equal steady blood sugar?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising things I learned was that blood sugar stability isn't just about what you eat. It's also about what you do after you eat. One afternoon, I had a slice of cake for a snack. No fiber or protein added, just the cake (I had lunch a few hours before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of my blood sugar spiking, my glucose levels remained steadily in range. The caveat? I took a brisk walk after having my dessert. It wasn't anything strenuous, just a short 15-minute walk around my neighborhood. But it was enough to help my body process and use the glucose more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body knows that exercise demands more energy, and so it helps open up our cells to soak up sugar (energy) and remove it from our blood. A 10-minute walk burns about 30 to 40 calories, and your body will get that energy from circulating glucose or stored glycogen," Fitton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating cake and going for a walk, my blood sugar saw a slight spike, but stayed within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/walking-after-eating" target="_self"&gt;walk after meals&lt;/a&gt; has long been recommended by experts for metabolic health, but seeing the effect in real time made it click for me. I do think that having the cake after having a balanced meal with protein and fiber also contributed to my steady levels of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it's not about completely eliminating our favorite treats or carbs, but more so about timing, food pairing and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways I learned to flatten my glucose curve without sacrificing my favorite meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using the glucose sensor with Oura, I assumed blood sugar spikes were mostly about foods and how they impact your body. I also thought the only way to manage them was to cut carbs or drastically change my diet. But over these two weeks, I experienced firsthand how and when I eat (and move) matter just as much as what I eat. I learned that these three strategies helped keep my glucose levels in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pair carbs and sweets with protein, fiber and healthy fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had a berry smoothie with protein powder and soy milk, my glucose levels stayed steady. In contrast, when I had a fruit smoothie earlier that week, my blood sugar levels spiked and crashed more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Carbs on their own, especially refined and processed carbs, can spike blood sugar quickly, but adding protein or fat slows digestion and leads to a more gentle spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food pairing examples: &lt;/strong&gt;Apples and peanut butter, toast with avocado, rice with beans or another protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniela Duncan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walk it out (especially after sweets)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had cake as a snack, I was sure my graph would spike dramatically, but it didn't because of my walk (and eating a balanced meal before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple walk, even just 10 to 15 minutes, can help offset blood sugar spikes. This small but simple habit helps me now enjoy treats without the crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timing your food matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that when I ate higher-carb foods earlier in the day, my body processed them better than when I had them later at night. Breakfast smoothies and bowls kept my levels stable, while the same smoothie after 9 p.m. caused more spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to blood sugar management, we see that in the morning our body usually has a spike in cortisol (a stress hormone) that can actually help our body take up sugar very quickly and quickly manage blood sugar. Eating in the morning will also calm the cortisol response, reducing the stress on your body. If you wait too long to eat, excess cortisol can create inflammation and also produce larger glucose spikes when you do eat," explained Fitton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that, conversely, in the evening, the sugar management systems in our bodies start powering down and are not as good at helping blood sugar get into the cells. So it is important to try not to eat too late; otherwise, you'll probably see blood sugar go up and stay up for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you can't eat carbs or treats at night, but eating them earlier in the day when insulin sensitivity tends to be higher can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPYmJIaGlBQ25NYUhNV0JxQktHTlc3LXhOTm9mbHdLYU11TVJUZXYxTHhNdHlZMkE1cDA4dVEtNkxPQThTQ1YtM1VkRkZ4SFc4MHRsdF9KVmRKdEQ1Uzh3UU1NWU9QbzdrbVNNUEFLTGdxanczdEd4Y3ExSDNleVJVNXVELVNSNXAtWjlWQnRpaFFBVVlEM3Q1QXJlVE1zMkpaVEc0S1k5WFZiM05TT1lwZlh4eHFnT3cwaEJQV1dfMkFmTVhKcXg0</guid></item><item><title>我的女儿， 9岁，在例行去看牙医后引发致命的血液状况后死亡-每日邮报 | My daughter, 9, died after a routine trip to the dentist triggered deadly blood condition - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPTkhmYUdUb2RNQVQ5Q19MaUhSSlQzZTZIdHNnTlNCcDl1aVk0elRVV2ttRVd1ZlFYVVgyeXZDZk9xbUNkT2owUzJpZG1vUG5nX0JQamg3MTB4WkdoLTYyNURNRWh6Ynp5aWJGa2k5UlhvYW1abkU5VlJZZ1M2LUVjNDBodG5zUjdoS21EQjF4VElZeG8tajRscHFn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1nOGdpM3cwWUtodTVUMXpyb01IajVDQ3FSdm94MjQ1RkdkQXgzdzlFT2NCUFp1MHhuUkhPc0ViWVFSUWZndG1QSzJud1JUNG4yU2NrYWNRb1ZoMDFUYUFwQ3ZYeFZTUERveTdzWnBTeEpzcVdfeFI4WHkwdXlZekY4OHlpUzdMbHV1ck14bnlpVWM1YzBRNWR3YjFGeFJ3aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A nine-year-old was left dead after a freak accident occurred while she was at a routine dentist appointment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silvanna Moreno, 9, from San Diego, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-b3443f90-4885-11f0-a1bc-256a2104db0b"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, was at the dentist getting a root canal and several cavities filled. There were no complications and afterward Moreno was moved to the recovery room in a wheelchair before being taken to her mother's car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the drive home she was described as 'out of it', and fell asleep snoring loudly. She was taken to her bedroom, but then her snoring slowed and began to quieten — prompting her mother to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to the hospital after her heart stopped, reports said, where doctors tried to resuscitate her without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The San Diego&lt;span&gt; Medical Examiner's Office has now discovered in a report, viewed by DailyMail.com, that she was suffering from methemoglobinemia — a condition in which blood cannot carry adequate oxygen through the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition can be genetic, but can also be triggered by prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, which is often used in dental procedures for mild sedation and to reduce anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nitrous oxide normally diffuses directly into the brain after being breathed in through the nose, but can also enter the blood where it can&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14569099/mom-warning-hippy-crack-daughter-dies-nitrous-oxide-canisters.html"&gt; bind to hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, the protein that carries oxygen, and leave it unable to carry out its function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreno was receiving nitrous oxide during her appointment but it's not known if she had been previously diagnosed methemoglobinemia — which estimates suggest may affect up to one in 3,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Silvanna Moreno (pictured), 9, died after having dental surgery under anesthesia at Dreamtime Dentistry in March this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrous oxide exposure can appear in minutes to hours later, and include a bluish tinge to the lips, difficulty breathing and struggling to stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No foul play is suspected in the girl's death, which was stated as methemoglobinemia in the setting of recent nitrous oxide administration and ruled an accident by the medical examiner. There is no suspicion that anyone at the dentist's office acted improperly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In methemoglobinemia, blood cells contain a higher level of methemoglobin — a form of hemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, the blood contains about zero to two percent methemoglobin, but in methemoglobinemia these levels rise to anywhere between 15 and 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say that levels below 20 percent generally trigger no symptoms, while levels above 70 percent can prove fatal if someone is exposed to a gas like nitrous oxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965427/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; from Toxicology Reports estimates that exposure to nitrous oxide as a medical therapy is the second most common cause of methemoglobinemia — accounting for about 18 percent of cases in children and 13 percent of cases in adults among the nearly 300 cases surveyed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The genetic form of methemoglobinemia is rare, doctors say, with there being few reliable estimates on how many people have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Moreno's autopsy, carried out a day after her death, examiners found her blood's methemoglobin levels were 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They cautioned, however, that this may have been a significantly higher figure than that when she died, saying these levels can rise significantly in the hours after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dreamtime Dentistry (pictured), led by Dr. Ryan Watkins, said in a statement that the girl was awake at the time of her release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report also notes that she received other drugs while at the dental office, which they said could also have contributed to the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreno had received a root canal, placement of crowns and fillings and extraction of teeth at Dreamtime Dentistry in Vista, run by Dr Ryan Watkins, who has 20 years of experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a previous incident in 2016, however — revealed by online records with the Dental Board of California — he faced disciplinary action after a patient's heart stopped beating while under anesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual, who has not been named,&lt;span&gt; was hospitalized for two days and allegedly continued to suffer from a mild cognitive disorder for a year afterward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Watkins was placed on probation for 35 months by state dental regulators over the issue in 2020, meaning he could continue to practice — but only with enhanced observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement, Dr Watkins told People that methemoglobinemia is 'an extremely rare condition that can occur with nitrous oxide administration'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He insisted that Moreno 'never exhibited' any warning signs and that her oxygen saturation levels remained normal.

In a series of stories, I’ll be sharing my field notes as I make my way from here to &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;, in the hope that others might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="42OBN3TJXNDMHBY364FZHW2GHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In my case,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the clock is ticking because of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare cancer that usually attacks children and microscopically sneaks through blood and bone. I always thought I’d be cruising into old age, but, because of this cancer, my doctors think I’ll be lucky to see next winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GASE5FL77VGPZK3ERP3EB56G4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This unwelcome news came in September, 18 months after my initial diagnosis, when a full-body PET scan that tracks cancer hot spots showed that my sarcoma had metastasized, or migrated, from my upper-left chest to a nodule in my right lung and to the upper bones in both of my arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MGBZOZODRZG3NOWJGDAO67FVKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With this latest incursion, I was moving from curative to palliative treatment, from the hope of survival to negotiating less pain and better quality of life on the way to being dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="HQPBHXWXDVBGXETPLBW6H5NHTE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HQPBHXWXDVBGXETPLBW6H5NHTE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Change of course&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IQGYIK44J5E43A32VZFH5NJHJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I had spent much of 2023 undergoing a rigid course of chemotherapy. When that failed, I had a mastectomy aimed at containment. By&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;September, that, too, had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZEGIRTMDJF57BU3EWIWIZ4JOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Metastasized Ewing’s sarcoma is so rare among older adults that the stats are mostly extrapolated from pediatrics. However, the best available data suggests that adults fare less well than children, with only about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/ewing-tumor/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;39 percent&lt;/a&gt; living five years after diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society. In my case, the chances were estimated at 15 to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C7TESNEWAFH35A2PN2SRRV7UOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like most people, I had hoped to beat the odds. This was bolstered by the fact that I have not been bedridden a single day. Losing my hair during chemo was miserable, but, until recently, I have been ridiculously healthy. People have found it hard to believe that I’m anywhere near dying, and there have been days when it’s hard for me to believe it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2SP2CR5NGZFIFIM6TZT36LS64I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of that resilience is probably in my DNA. I am not prone to depression, and my parents, Holocaust survivors and immigrants, were forward-looking and resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IPR6OYSB5ZEXDEMZJPUMEUAOSM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IPR6OYSB5ZEXDEMZJPUMEUAOSM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Role models&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZW5TQW6OZFAVFC7QOEDKYCT6ZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’ve also had&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;good role models for how to die. My mom, felled by a cancer recurrence at 86, was a dressmaker who continued to work until about six months before her death. She put her affairs in order so my father, my two siblings and I wouldn’t lose sleep over financial paperwork. She also reached out to home hospice, visited with friends, remained in charge of her life almost to the end and died at home. My father died less than three months later, at age 98. Neither of them expressed any fear. They felt as if dying was just a part of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TXNQQGPRQZFDNFD6EDKS463TZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m now trying to approach my own death with that perspective. Like them, I do not believe in a higher being who actively determines the spans of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBQ3LY2WNRCLVM6TQPDAOOW3QA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am grateful that my illness, although weird and random, is part of the natural world, unlike violence or a death for which there is someone to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LGL4DPB2JNARDKIOM47JSMJAIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I consider my disease a colossal case of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OSE43X5HCRD63ISVISUVQM7YKQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OSE43X5HCRD63ISVISUVQM7YKQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Would it help?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SVA7QBEMFGDBJ6I2PX5WOKSPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So how am I dealing with this unexpected twist of life? Sometimes help comes from unexpected sources. Last year, I streamed a 2015 film called “Bridge of Spies.” The lawyer played by Tom Hanks takes a Soviet spy to be exchanged back to his country and possible death. “You’re not worried?” the lawyer asks the spy. And the spy responds, “Would it help?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FSAFF7T3KJGODAU6DGW2YTN7OE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I start feeling grim about my situation, I’m finding it useful to take a “Would it help?” moment to consider whether my response can improve the situation or help me cope. I’ve learned that feeling sorry for myself doesn’t make me feel better, although I have been known to utter the passing “oy” or bemoan my inability to plan very far in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CEOL3P6275AQVBA7EMN77MAHKE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CEOL3P6275AQVBA7EMN77MAHKE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Following the science&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UWIF4CMPFBH6VFU6RBTESVLSZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What helps me most is to be curious and follow the science. To get a fix on what I’m facing, I have made judicious use of the internet, trying not to obsess on those dismal survival rates. To avoid the many overwrought and under-validated sites waiting to lure me  down the rabbit hole, I have relied on the previously excellent National Institutes of Health websites, where one can access the latest studies. Although I don’t always grasp every word and nuance, I can usually get the key points. Now I worry that the cuts to NIH staff and funding will eviscerate this critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QA3BCA5A2FGNZM2PZBEVWECQ3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am also very lucky to be supported by a wonderful network of family and friends. When I was first diagnosed, I gave my sister, Jane, full access to my MyChart medical record so she could help me assess information and options. It doesn’t hurt that she’s a retired doctor, but any smart and steady person with whom you have rapport can be a real help. She and my brother, Gene, also hold my medical power of attorney, should the moment come when I am unable to make my own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UGYJJ2OL2RGJFOIJL4RSP7S4LY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the September PET scan results showed up in MyChart, I recognized that my situation had slid into new and negative territory. I took a deep breath and called my sister; she and I agreed that it didn’t look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDDEDZATBZEP3ISTN4P3AKSR3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few days later, my brother came down from New Jersey, and we trekked off to see the leading adult sarcoma expert at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, who calmly and candidly laid out the limited options, none of them great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ERHFYUPXFCJ3N53KTF7XV3YDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were several additional&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8071040/" target="_blank"&gt; chemotherapy combos&lt;/a&gt; that generally made people very sick without yielding much benefit in terms of longevity. None of the new immunology trials had yet been promising for my disease. There was the option of chasing new tumors with radiation wherever that was possible. And there was the choice to do nothing. Although each case is unique, the expert said he thought I could expect to live roughly another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BCWLQ6MQRAKNISMHEMZACXRR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Later, my brother and I sat at a cafe by the waterfront, picking at a late lunch in the fall sun. “I’m a dead duck,” I said. “I hate when you say that,” my brother responded, “and we have to kepe some hope, don’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LBIYTL6WHBFX3MSVOKT4OUR5I4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the challenges is to live with uncertainty in roughly three-month intervals, from scan to scan, learning to balance acceptance and hope. It helps to remember that doctors are people with special skills, not gods. One of the things I value about my medical team is that they are knowledgeable and candid, without being self-important. I’m confident they do the very best they can, but sometimes they just don’t know. And they can’t always save you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GB3C2PG7OJGL3GNPHRJBK7FM2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I decided to pursue the radiation option. To date, I’ve had&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;three courses of radiation treatment, and the first eight months have passed.

Pictured, billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, who has the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each line carried one of the genetic mutations most strongly associated with autism spectrum conditions (ASC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These cells were created using mouse embryonic stem cells—taken from early-stage mouse embryos—which have the unique ability to develop into any kind of tissue in the body, including brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No human embryos were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To introduce the mutations, the scientists used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology that allows precise changes to DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It enabled the team to effectively model autism in the lab—creating what some researchers describe as 'autism in a dish.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From these modified cells, the team was able to grow various types of brain tissue—and even generate adult mice with the same mutations—giving them a powerful way to study how genetic changes affect both brain structure and behaviour over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they found was striking. Across many of the mutations, a common problem emerged: the brain's waste-disposal system wasn't working properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain cells—particularly neurons, which carry electrical signals and control thought, emotion, and behaviour—were struggling to get rid of faulty internal components.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the study puts it, 'a lack of quality control of these proteins may be a causal factor of neuronal defects.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors note this is 'particularly interesting since the local production of proteins is a unique feature in neurons.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In simple terms, neurons are constantly producing new components to help them send messages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if they can't clear out old or broken parts, the system becomes clogged and starts to malfunction—potentially disrupting the brain networks that support communication, learning and social development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The implications may go beyond autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the same genetic mutations are also found in people with other mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the authors note: 'Interestingly, the genetic variants we studied are also implicated in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, this library may be useful for studying other conditions as well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The research, published in Cell Genomics, focused on identifying what different high-risk genetic variants actually do inside the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope that by better understanding what these mutations do, scientists will be able to identify new drug targets—and eventually, develop treatments tailored to a person's unique genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While any clinical application is still likely years away, the discovery marks a turning point in autism research—moving beyond simply spotting risk genes to uncovering the biological chain of events that may cause the condition in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows soaring rates of autism—with a 787 per cent rise in the number of diagnoses in the UK between 1998 and 2019 reported in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;2021 study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month NHS data showed that more than 200,000 people—triple that in 2021—are waiting for an autism assessment in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous figures with ASC include environmental activist Greta Thunberg, 22, and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, 53, founder of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the condition affects people in many different ways, some autistic individuals do not view it as an illness requiring a 'cure'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they see it as a difference—one that should be understood and accommodated, rather than treated or fixed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Kobe University research is not the first to examine genetic links to the condition to provide an answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, experts found some cases of autism may be caused by the genetic condition myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with the little-known genetic condition were found to be 14 times more likely to develop autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies have suggested environmental factors could be a potential cause of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, research found a common plastic additive found in everything from pacifiers to metal foods had been linked to an increased risk of autism in boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It found that higher levels of chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in a pregnant mother's urine more than tripled the chances a young boy developing autism symptoms by the age of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those same boys were six times more likely to be diagnosed with autism by age 11 — compared to those whose mothers had lower BPA levels during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemical BPA is intended to harden plastics and prevent metals from rusting, among other uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been dubbed a 'gender-bending' chemical due to its apparent role spurring hormonal and sexual disruptions in humans, fish and other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the increased attention to this symptom comes as the Nimbus subvariant has caused surges of COVID-19 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-30/a-new-covid-subvariant-spreads-rapidly-as-trump-pivots-away-from-vaccines"&gt;in other countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before Omicron, I think most people presented with the usual loss of taste and smell as the predominant symptom and shortness of breath,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert. But as COVID has become less likely to require hospitalization, “people are focusing on these other aspects of symptoms,” such as an extraordinarily painful sore throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the Omicron family, Nimbus is now one of the most dominant coronavirus subvariants nationally. For the two-week period that ended June 7, Nimbus &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank"&gt;comprised&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 37% of the nation’s coronavirus samples, now roughly even with the subvariant LP.8.1,  probably responsible for 38% of circulating virus. LP.8.1 has been dominant over the past few months, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nimbus subvariant has also been increasing since May in California, the state Department of Public Health said in an email to the Los Angeles Times. Projections suggest the Nimbus subvariant comprises 55% of circulating virus  in California, up from observations of just 2% in April, the agency said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing some indicators of increased COVID-19 activity, including the rise of the NB.1.8.1 variant, elevated coronavirus levels in wastewater, and an uptick in the test positivity rate,” Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, wrote in an email to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater surveillance across Southern California shows variability: Santa Barbara watersheds are reporting moderate-to-high levels, Ventura and Los Angeles counties are seeing low-to-moderate levels, Riverside is reporting low levels, while San Bernardino is experiencing high activity,” Hudson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While viral concentrations remain relatively low, Los Angeles County has observed an increase in coronavirus levels in sewage, the local Department of Public Health told The Times. For the week that ended May 30 — the most recent available — viral levels in wastewater rose by 13% versus a comparable period several weeks earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a slight increase in the rate in which COVID surveillance tests are turning up positive in L.A. County. For the most recent week, 5% of COVID surveillance tests showed positive results for infection, up from 3.8% in early May. COVID-related visits to the emergency room remain low in Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were still low rates of COVID-19 illness in San Francisco, the local Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet coronavirus levels in wastewater in Northern California’s most populous county, Santa Clara County, are starting to increase, “just as they have over past summers,” the local Public Health Department said in an email to The Times. As of Friday, coronavirus levels in the sewershed of San José was considered “high.” Viral levels were “medium” in Palo Alto and “low” in Sunnyvale. Nimbus is the most common subvariant in the county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, coronavirus levels in wastewater are at a “medium” level; the last time viral levels were consistently “low” was in April, according to the state Department of Public Health’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/#shiny-tab-overview" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future seasonal increases in disease levels are likely,” the California Department of Public Health said in an email to The Times Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uptick in COVID comes as many medical professional organizations and some state and local health officials are objecting to the Trump administration’s recent moves on vaccine policy, which some experts fear will make it more difficult for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and other diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials in May &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-31/cdc-radically-changes-its-covid-vaccine-recommendations-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;weakened&lt;/a&gt; the CDC’s official recommendations from recommending the COVID vaccine to everyone age 6 months and up. The CDC now offers “no guidance” on whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine, and now asks that parents of healthy children talk with a healthcare provider before asking that their kids get inoculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/cdc-faqs-on-vaccination-during-pregnancy-sow-doubt-misuse-data" target="_blank"&gt;rebuke&lt;/a&gt; of the changing vaccine recommendations for pregnant women, accusing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — led by the vaccine-skeptic secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — of “propagating misinformation.” The American Pharmacists Assn. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-withholds-endorsement-of-acip-adult-immunization-schedule" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that dropping the vaccine recommendation for pregnant women did “not appear to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/viewpoint-rfks-reckless-firing-cdc-vaccine-advisors-not-supported-evidence" target="_blank"&gt;based&lt;/a&gt; on the scientific evidence provided over the last few years.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And an open letter by 30 organizations specializing in health — including the American Medical Assn. — &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that “we must continue to prioritize high levels of COVID-19 vaccine coverage in pregnant patients to protect them and their infants after birth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said he recommends pregnant women get vaccinated “one million percent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data are incredibly clear that pregnant women do have a higher rate of complications, hospitalization and premature births when they did not get vaccinated [against COVID] compared to the ones that did,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease expert at Stanford University. The vaccines also help newborns, as antibodies generated by the mom-to-be cross the placenta, and can protect the newborn for a certain number of months, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s essential protection, given that newborns can’t be vaccinated under 6 months of age, Maldonado said. If newborns are infected, they have relatively high rates of hospitalization — as high as those age 65 and over, Maldonado said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, last week, Kennedy abruptly &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-09/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all members of a highly influential committee that advises the CDC on vaccine policy. In an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112" target="_blank"&gt;op-ed to the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy criticized the previous members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, founded in 1964, as being “plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maldonado, a professor in pediatric infectious diseases and epidemiology, was one of the fired vaccine advisors. She called their mass dismissal unprecedented in the history of the ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are absolutely in uncharted territory here,” Maldonado said. “I think it’s going to be really hard to understand what vaccines are going to go forward. ... They’re also going to review the entire vaccination schedule.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, routine review of vaccine schedules are a good thing, and prior reviews have concluded that the current recommended shots are safe and effective, Maldonado said. But the criteria being circulated by recently appointed federal officials “could actually wind up refusing to recommend, say, measles vaccine or HPV vaccine, because I’ve seen some of the misinformation that has been out there about some of these vaccines. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And if any of that is accepted as truth, we could wind up losing some of these vaccines,” Maldonado said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question, then, is: ‘Would those vaccines disappear?’ ... Hard to know,” she said. But it’s also possible that federal officials could begin to stop paying for certain vaccines to be administered to children of low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She rejected Kennedy’s characterization of the committee as a rubber stamp for vaccine makers. “Generally, a decision to not pursue a vaccine happens usually well before anything gets to a vote,” Maldonado said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/12/california-oregon-washington-condemn-dismissal-of-cdc-vaccine-panel-call-on-other-states-to-join-them/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; by the governors of California, Oregon and Washington condemned Kennedy’s dismissal of the vaccine advisors as “deeply troubling for the health of the nation” and defended the fired vaccine advisors as having been “carefully screened for major conflicts of interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have grave concerns about the integrity and transparency of upcoming federal vaccine recommendations and will continue to collaborate to ensure that science and sound medicine prevail to prevent any loss of life,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/12/california-oregon-washington-condemn-dismissal-of-cdc-vaccine-panel-call-on-other-states-to-join-them/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the advisory committee’s recommendations on who should get vaccinated were adopted by the director of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was one of the most depressing weeks in American health ... a dark period for everyone right now, and demoralizing,” said Chin-Hong, of UC San Francisco. “It’s very destabilizing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics called the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-statement-on-changes-to-advisory-committee-on-immunization-practices/" target="_blank"&gt;purge&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine advisors “an escalating effort by the administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines.” Kennedy’s handpicked replacements include people known for their criticism of vaccines, the Associated Press &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mass firing “likely puts vaccine access and insurance coverage at serious risk,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement. “It corrodes trust in the recommended schedule for vaccines, not only by the public, but by medical providers who rely on the ACIP for science-based, apolitical guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departments of public health for California, Oregon and Washington said they “continue to recommend all individuals age 6 months and older should have access and the choice to receive currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines, with an emphasis on protecting higher risk individuals, such as infants and toddlers, pregnant individuals, and others with risks for serious disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement that, “at this time in Los Angeles County, current vaccine recommendations for persons aged 6 months and older to receive the COVID-19 vaccine remain in effect and insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines is still in place.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPTXJzZGl5ZndabUJreEV0aUVYeGdadGVOV085UEtJdDVncXNWSFZRdjVzNHFBU0I0M2lmcTB2VG01Ul9wUmFfQlU0dng2VnlGVDBHMm9xWE9iQXVtOVJFUEQwZEdiY3FQbXpIZExucklJWDB1R0JIUlJPcUxFOG9BVEJ0VTZYR3pLdmFaUmZRUE9CTVVRc0RLZGIzVzlmSUNoc2Z4VElwQVBsZmZMekVr</guid></item><item><title>对人类“过敏”的人- BBC | The people who are 'allergic' to humans - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPREsyR2o2SnpCU2lpX1RCR08wbkdwbThhMmRDRGFwUWc5aHVJck5vMl9ITW5kcEZoS2Rxb3lvR3NvNHFJcHAzNTFUUGp5aGZOTjJhaGU3bmhuT3IteTRrWFJQOWNtUWhya1l2cVNrdzFnVENhNXlCLTJ4UVQ1N251OVFZVFV3WkFh?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;The people who are 'allergic' to humans&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj4w8y.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A person sitting on a bench and looking out to sea (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;(Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="some-people-are-allergic-to-others-–-but-the-mystery-of-how-this-works-is-only-just-starting-to-be-unravelled." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Some people are allergic to others – but the mystery of how this works is only just starting to be unravelled.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Maura believes condoms saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now 43 and living in Ohio, US, Maura says the problem first started in her twenties, when it slowly crept up on her. “I noticed that my genitals burned after [unprotected] sex," she recounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-2d378821-0 duQDIB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-1 dBCBSi"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-2d378821-3 djFilw"&gt;Content warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-2 bjvxgb"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This article contains sexually explicit language and themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Maura (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy) didn't feel comfortable mentioning it to her partner. So, she'd wait until he left and then wash herself thoroughly. She tried changing the personal care products she was using, from soap to lubricant. But the problem only worsened, extending to swelling and redness. And it only happened after she came into contact with semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Eventually she broke up with that man, and started seeing one who was dedicated to using condoms. "It wasn't an issue until one night when we were lying in bed after sex and my tongue suddenly began to swell," Maura recounts. "My partner saw what was happening, screamed, 'You're asphyxiating!' and grabbed my inhaler…he was able to cram my inhaler into the corner of my mouth, and he just started firing it.

She and her long-term partner are now even more careful about condom usage.

PATM is an unusual and isolating phenomenon where others frequently develop allergy-type symptoms, such as coughing and choking, in their presence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2023, Yoshika Sekine, a professor of chemistry at Japan's Tokai University, and his colleagues investigated the skin gases emitted by those reporting symptoms of PATM. Of the 75 skin gases the team studied, toluene was especially likely to be present. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36615-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;People in the PATM group emitted 39 times more of this chemical&lt;/a&gt;, on average, than those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Toluene is inhaled through the air during breathing. As a harmful compound, it is typically metabolised by the liver and excreted in the urine," Sekine explains. "However, PATM patients have a diminished ability to break down toluene, leading to its accumulation in the bloodstream and subsequent release through the skin," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sekine notes that the very concept of PATM is still not widely recognised, and there are no diagnostic criteria for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="from-bodily-fluids" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="from-bodily-fluids" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;From bodily fluids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Allergic reactions can also be triggered by specific allergens carried in bodily fluids. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol17-issue3-num224?1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In one UK case&lt;/a&gt;, a woman with an allergy to Brazil nuts developed hives and shortness of breath after having sex with a man who had eaten mixed nuts a few hours earlier, even though he had cleaned his teeth, nails and skin in between. Nuts have also led to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200206063462320" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;allergic reactions during kissing&lt;/a&gt; in people with severe allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While nuts are the most commonly reported allergen posing an issue during kissing, saliva has also induced allergic reactions following the consumption of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurannallergyimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/complete-issue-4824allp1.pdf#page=5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;fruits, vegetables, seafood and milk&lt;/a&gt;.

It has been recorded mainly in people in their 20s and 30s, although there have been fewer than 100 documented cases overall, according to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2024.1403477/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the fluid, apart from sperm, that makes up the majority of semen, and the allergy is to a protein within it, rather than the sperm itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's not clear exactly what is occurring in the body in people with seminal plasma hypersensitivity, explains Jonathan Bernstein, a professor of clinical medicine, focusing on allergy and immunology, at the University of Cincinnati’s College of Medicine in the US. Bernstein says that there aren't good animal models for seminal plasma hypersensitivity, or enough humans with the condition to enable large-scale research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The local symptoms can include severe pain and burning immediately after intercourse. "It's [reportedly] like acid," Bernstein says. One of his patients described it as "like a thousand needles being stuck into your vagina."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-2d378821-0 duQDIB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-1 dBCBSi"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-2d378821-3 djFilw"&gt;What we don’t know about sperm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A person might be sensitive to the semen of multiple partners or just one, Bernstein notes. Diagnosis typically involves a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;skin prick test using a fresh sample of seminal fluid&lt;/a&gt; from a sexual partner. In his practice, Bernstein typically sees women in monogamous relationships with men, often when they're trying to get pregnant. Some people travel long distances to consult with him, as there aren't many authorities on semen allergy. Many patients get brushed aside or are started on aggressive steroid treatments because medical professionals don't know what to do with them, Bernstein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Bernstein explains that his practice is able to help just about everyone with a semen allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is a notable absence of data about semen allergies among men who have sex with men. Bernstein says he has never seen a case of this, though it’s unclear why. He wondered if the symptoms could be related to the particular conditions within the vagina, though this doesn’t explain the case where it occurred after anal sex between a man and a woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="treatment-options" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="treatment-options" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Treatment options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Immune reactions to other humans can have distressing consequences (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Immune reactions to other humans can have distressing consequences (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Bernstein and his colleagues found that it was reportedly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1081120613000057" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;equally safe and effective to localise the treatment&lt;/a&gt;, in a one-time procedure of about two hours. First, they separated the sperm from the seminal fluid. Then they diluted the seminal fluid to one part in a million or one in ten million, depending on how severe the patient's reactions were. Then, at intervals of 15 minutes, they inserted the fluid into the patient's vagina. They gradually used stronger concentrations of the fluid, so that the patient developed a greater tolerance. Throughout, they continued monitoring the patient. As a result, "they don't tend to have many systemic reactions and they are able to tolerate unprotected intercourse thereafter" with at least that partner, Bernstein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, hypersensitivity to seminal plasma remains often &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;misunderstood and misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. There's even less information about certain other fluids transmitted during sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14762" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;almost no published research&lt;/a&gt; on possible allergy to cervicovaginal fluid – a liquid secreted by the cells of the cervix and vagina, which helps to lubricate this region and provide some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3016264/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;protection from pathogens&lt;/a&gt;. However, Marek Jankowski believes that he’s seen at least one person with this condition. Jankowski, an assistant professor of dermatology and venereology at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Poland, says he once treated a patient who came to him after seeing a host of other doctors. The patient reported that about 30 minutes after vaginal intercourse, his genitals would become red and itchy. His face would also itch after cunnilingus. To the patient, this seemed like an allergy, but doctors ridiculed or rejected this idea, says Jankowski. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Jankowski kept an open mind, looking up other cases of potential allergy to cervicovaginal fluid secreted by women during sexual activity. "Ultimately the patient responded well to antihistamines," he reports. The case also prompted Jankowski and his colleagues to carry out &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14550" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2017. The researchers surveyed other dermatologists as well as people who might be experiencing this condition. One-fifth of the dermatologists who responded had witnessed such cases, they reported, though many doctors remained sceptical that the condition existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;The emotional impacts can be complex, for both sufferers and their partners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to this research, sufferers reported redness, itch, burning, swelling and hives following contact. Their reports &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14550" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;led Jankowski and his colleagues to estimate&lt;/a&gt; that allergy to cervicovaginal fluid was as common as semen allergy, which is thought to affect at least tens of thousands of people in the US alone. However, "the current level of evidence for cervicovaginal fluid allergy phenomenon is only circumstantial and further research in this field would be necessary," Jankowski explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One difference between allergies to semen versus cervicovaginal fluid is that condoms would be unlikely to relieve the symptoms of any allergy to the latter, since condoms &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14550" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;would not shield the groin and scrotum&lt;/a&gt;. But both antihistamines and repeat exposure appeared to help the survey respondents with their allergy to cervicovaginal fluid, according to the survey results of Jankowski and his coauthors. "As [the] majority of cases identified were young adults early in the sexual relationship, the flame of passion was apparently stronger than the discomfort, and repetitive [exposure] to the allergen led to desensitisation," Jankowski notes. This differs from seminal plasma hypersensitivity, which is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;not known to resolve itself naturally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For the people who are allergic to some aspect of their partner, the consequences can be grave. Maura believes that her semen sensitivity played a part in her and her partner's decision to not have children, because she expects that it would have been expensive to find a workaround that enabled her to avoid exposure to semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The emotional impacts can be complex, for both sufferers and their partners. While Maura's relationship is safe and her partner is happy to use condoms, "he did tell me that he was offended by the idea that I was allergic to his semen," she says. “He doesn't blame me for that, just the universe." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:15:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPREsyR2o2SnpCU2lpX1RCR08wbkdwbThhMmRDRGFwUWc5aHVJck5vMl9ITW5kcEZoS2Rxb3lvR3NvNHFJcHAzNTFUUGp5aGZOTjJhaGU3bmhuT3IteTRrWFJQOWNtUWhya1l2cVNrdzFnVENhNXlCLTJ4UVQ1N251OVFZVFV3WkFh</guid></item><item><title>这种常见草药可能有助于对抗阿尔茨海默氏症、焦虑和睡眠不佳-英国赫芬顿邮报 | This Common Herb May Help To Fight Alzheimer's, Anxiety And Poor Sleep - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPSlhDa0tPRFpWdV8zWmk3aUFBdzhmZFVGMEtjNHlWYjZSam1WNk5YazF0dmNLN0FDSGRpT3E1VzVSUWZQVWhFUVJNWl94NnotM2wtRDlzM2hCb0FuQ3ZqMXo3RVpRTS1UbGdkT2ZoNXR5UTJYZFZPMmtLd3hTRFlpWTFxbmw5b1Jvd3d5ajZSRldmc0FycFU1OHYzOUwwcmxzRkQ1RndhdWxVWmfSAbIBQVVfeXFMTk1iRTcyYzBzcEkwR2l4Nzl6dkI1UzFtQkl5WEd3SEZaYmVWOERsVUUwc0xZTWVpU2lLQWI3c3E1UEVTODBpTUU0SVZ0cGwtamlrSFRveVpfX3ppdVhJZERzSFJIdnZyWjJmVWhtSXVXdUFVMGQtd0JvdEdNTlZqcDFYR0dhQlA2cl9pT3JKaHprU09YNzFLdVFlSzMtbVMxWTdONkNFc2lsOFFoWURISGNUZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not all of our brain health risk is in our control, &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mediterranean-diet-dementia-depression_uk_6847ffabe4b0682b100bc684" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="some promising studies have found links" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="684fd4abe4b03c462a0557fb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6847ffabe4b0682b100bc684" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;some promising studies have found links&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Cynthia Cherish Malaran didn't like the piano lessons she took as a child, so it amused the native New Yorker that she found second-career success as a DJ a decade ago, spinning tunes for MTV, Lincoln Center and other clients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was playing music for people, watching them forget about their stress and forget about whatever worries them and just be present on the dance floor," says Malaran, who would watch their catharsis from the sidelines. "I never — even in my career as a DJ — thought of music for my own healing, until I really needed it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;When a 'miracle drug' disappoints&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That time came a decade ago when, at age 39, Malaran was diagnosed with breast cancer. Following chemotherapy and surgery, her best hopes of remaining cancer-free rested largely on &lt;a href="https://www.herceptin.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Herceptin&lt;/a&gt;, a medicine so effective at targeting her specific form of disease that patients like her call it their "miracle drug." But after only a few rounds, Malaran proved allergic — and there was no substitute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Malaran implored her oncologist, "What should I do?" The doctor responded, simply: "Be happy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I couldn't believe she said that," recalls Malaran. &lt;em&gt;How is that even possible?&lt;/em&gt; Then she understood: "I realized if I can manage my stress and my emotions, that I would have the best chances of surviving, even though I was taken off of treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Sessions over seven weeks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Managing the various &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38754041/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;symptoms &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and anxieties that often accompany cancer through music therapy, it turns out, is as effective as traditional cognitive behavioral therapy, according to &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT484372" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study presented&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting this month. The study involved seven weeks of a hybrid kind of therapy, combining talk, music and lyrical composition as forms of expression. During sessions, trained therapists might help put a patient's words or feelings to a melody, for example, or they might co-write a tune. Or simply listen.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There was a time period when these were viewed as kind of outside the mainstream," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/kevin-liou" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kevin Liou&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study's author and a specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who's helping patients &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37582238/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrate auxiliary care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; such as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;acupuncture, herbal remedies and music therapy into their cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Millions of survivors&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of so many improvements in cancer diagnosis and treatment, many millions more people are surviving the disease, often for many years. As a result, the population of cancer survivors has surged in recent decades to &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/Cancer-Survivors-Increase#:~:text=ATLANTA%2C%20May%2030%2C%202025%20%E2%80%94,American%20Cancer%20Society%20(ACS)." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;18.6 million people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. alone, according to the American Cancer Society's &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/Cancer-Survivors-Increase#:~:text=ATLANTA%2C%20May%2030%2C%202025%20%E2%80%94,American%20Cancer%20Society%20(ACS)." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most recent report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With that, says Liou, comes more need for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36122322/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;varied therapies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to improve their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We want to have a wide range of tools so that we can better personalize treatments for people."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The next phase of research is to look at characteristics of patients likely to benefit from music therapy, Liou says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For Malaran, music therapy was a natural fit. She found Liou's "Melody Study" through Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital. During sessions, Malaran sometimes wrote lyrics to express her emotions, or just hummed along, listening. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Picture yourself feeling unwell and someone is serenading you — just you — and how much better you feel because you're being seen and cared for that way," Malaran explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The act of creation &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Liou says what sets music therapy apart from passive listening or playing music on one's own is the therapeutic collaboration. Through conversation and music &lt;em&gt;creation&lt;/em&gt;, patients access another way to process their emotions, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's actively creating something, and you're doing it with the guidance of a trained music therapist."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Malaran says music could give expression to emotions for which there were no apt words. The healing, she says, was in that expression: "Creating something beautiful coming from my cancer is like the ultimate way for me to heal."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;She's now a decade in remission, and it's been three years since she completed the therapy, but she still hums whenever she feels uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't even sing for fun. But humming is something I still do even today — years after those sessions — as a way to regulate my stress and bring my nervous system back to level ground and to relax," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It happened just the other day, she says. She felt worries creep in, and then the vibrations calmed her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn't suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's crazy," said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. "All of a sudden, they flip."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn't address appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/216665s000lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;approved Vykat XR&lt;/a&gt;, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more than 40%&lt;/a&gt; of American adults. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-warning-data-david-kessler/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;GLP-1 agonist medications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ozempic, Wegovy, and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's becoming clear is that obesity isn't one disease — it's many, said &lt;a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/jack-yanovski" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Jack Yanovski&lt;/a&gt;, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity's drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. "It only makes sense that it's complex to treat," Yanovski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn't respond to those drugs, and at least &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/108/1/4/6736895" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; the medications didn't significantly help Prader-Willi patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity's many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation's infrastructure for medical discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a "Make America Healthy Again" agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-expert-calls-trumps-medical-research-cuts-reckless-destruction/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;federal funding for health research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00812-x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;University labs&lt;/a&gt; face cuts, FDA staffers are being &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/fda-rehires-foia-staff-public-records-requests-layoffs-trump-hhs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;laid off en masse&lt;/a&gt;, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now," said &lt;a href="https://www.fpwr.org/pws-research-publications/author/theresa-strong" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Theresa Strong&lt;/a&gt;, research director for the &lt;a href="https://www.fpwr.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Foundation for Prader-Willi Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. "We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she'd spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She's heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://endo.pediatrics.med.ufl.edu/profile/miller-jennifer-6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Jennifer Miller&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she's seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. "It opens up their world in so many ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 26 years in practice, she's also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean's mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                  &lt;span class="embed__caption"&gt;Ali Foley Shenk (right) and her son Dean, at their home in Richmond, Virginia. Dean was born with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder that causes hyperphagia, a medical term for insatiable hunger. Since starting on a new medication as part of a clinical trial, his symptoms have improved, his mother says.&lt;/span&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body's strongest hunger signals. "In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away," said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of &lt;a href="https://soleno.life/about-us/team/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Soleno Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the medication, the company's first drug. "In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn't exist. It's literally your brain telling you, 'You're starving,' as you eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vykat XR's possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the drug's average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be "minimal." Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soleno's stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLNO/key-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;$4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as of early June.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc5" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite," said &lt;a href="https://www.ouhealth.com/find-a-doctor/jesse-r-richards-do/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Jesse Richards&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa's School of Community Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He's more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable," Foley Shenk said. "Now, we have our son back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He woke up before 5 a.m., and according to his father, Will Hand, things went downhill fast. In a heartbreaking Facebook post, he wrote, "Everything snowballed and God called him home." He shared a photo of his son, remembering him with "flowing hair, big smile and in sports attire," saying, "I will see you again, son."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happened to William?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will had developed a rare blood infection called meningococcemia—also known as meningococcal septicemia. It’s caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which enters the bloodstream and spreads quickly. Once it kicks in, it can be extremely hard to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told Fox Carolina, how brutal the illness can be: “The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it’s very hard to save the person who is infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets—meaning things like kissing, sharing drinks, or using the same utensils can pass it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does someone catch it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal septicemia is basically a rare—and very serious—blood infection caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. You might’ve heard more about meningitis, which is when the same bacteria attack the lining of the brain and spinal cord. But in septicemia, instead of staying in the brain, the bacteria invade your bloodstream and start causing chaos throughout your entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bacteria normally lives quietly in the back of the nose and throat of some people (called carriers) without making them sick. But every now and then, it can go rogue—especially if it finds its way into the bloodstream. Once it's in your blood, it multiplies like crazy and starts releasing toxins that damage blood vessels, mess with your circulation, and can quickly lead to organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does someone catch it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It spreads through close contact—think coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing things like drinks, straws, water bottles, lip balm, or utensils. You usually have to be in close or prolonged contact with someone who is carrying the bacteria. That’s why outbreaks can happen in places like college dorms, military barracks, or households where people are living close together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what actually happens? Once these bacteria enter the blood, they multiply rapidly and release toxins that can damage blood vessels. This can lead to internal bleeding, organ failure, and tissue damage—sometimes in just a matter of hours. That’s what makes it so terrifying: the speed. One minute a person might just feel a little unwell, and within a day—or sometimes even less—they’re in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms can look like a regular flu or a bad cold. We're talking fever, chills, body aches, nausea, cold hands and feet, or a fast heart rate. In kids and teens, symptoms can include extreme tiredness, irritability, or a rash that doesn’t fade when pressed (a big red flag). That rash comes from bleeding under the skin, caused by blood vessel damage. It might start out as small red or purple spots and then spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is how fast it moves. With many illnesses, you’ve got some time to figure out what’s going on. Not with this one. That’s why doctors and parents are always urged to trust their instincts—if someone looks seriously sick and symptoms are worsening quickly, it’s better to get them to a hospital ASAP rather than wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? It’s treatable—but only if caught early. Meningococcal septicemia is usually treated with strong antibiotics through an IV. Fluids, oxygen, and sometimes even medications to support blood pressure may also be needed. In severe cases, people may end up in the ICU or require surgery to remove damaged tissue. Even then, survivors might face long-term effects like hearing loss, amputations, or organ damage. That’s how serious this infection can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal septicemia is rare, but when it strikes, it’s aggressive. Knowing the signs, acting quickly, and staying vaccinated can make all the difference. It’s one of those “better safe than sorry” situations where awareness really can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 06:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>一位骨盆底专家说， 70%的患者挤压不正确，这些是她最大限度地利用凯格尔的建议- Fit&amp;Well | A pelvic floor expert says 70% of her patients do squeezes incorrectly—these are her tips on getting the most out of kegels - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPQmpubmxHbUw1S0FpRUs4ZWVReWdfUnFMbjd5LTFyWUo5YjZqZEJ3UkdET21BbDBEcFJrQVRuR3JyNnZHalh2aGRuU3hIUEgwSWFqbGJibzlvOXdWNFJGSFZ3YkVydTdHbkpKUHpYRFBRNGNJd19RQmRWbmdveVQwenVFSUtvUDU4WlBzc25XdGdoM1A1cFZZLWVHekIyWVNNY3lVVmdrZlFtdDFyNExyNkprSzFTeEVJYUtMNXNPZDNwRmNVX0loVnJqS2JteGEzV0hMVDFBcUdCRUo2WFJvTV9WY0cyVDFOX0EyRjd1UUh2Y3k1bHdUQzFR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kegel exercises, also known as pelvic floor squeezes, are one of the most common and effective ways to build strength and control in your pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercises can help you work towards preventing or reducing the severity of pelvic floor issues such as incontinence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, according to Leanne O'Brien, pelvic floor physical therapist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ten.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ten.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ten Health&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a chance you’re not doing them properly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Around 70% of people aren't doing pelvic floor exercises correctly and I can vouch for that clinically,” O’Brien tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “If the technique isn’t good, you won’t be getting the maximum benefit of the exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-not-to-do-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How not to do pelvic floor squeezes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the common mistakes happens because people struggle with which body part they should be squeezing. “They’ll start squeezing their bum cheeks together, or they’ll squeeze their inner thighs together, or they’ll grip their abdominal muscles,” says O’Brien.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If you do this, it will start to press the pelvic floor down again,” which is the opposite of what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do pelvic floor squeezes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re doing pelvic floor squeezes properly, “no-one would be able to tell that you’re doing them”, says O’Brien, because none of your body parts should move. Instead, you’re squeezing the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Anal_Canal" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Anal_Canal" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;rectum&lt;/a&gt;, which is located between your colon and anus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine that you’re stopping yourself from emptying your bowel or stopping yourself from farting,” says O’Brien. “We're squeezing the bum hole, to be graphic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also think of squeezing the vaginal muscles at the same time. “Try to imagine that you have a blueberry just at the vaginal entrance, and you're trying to draw that up and in towards the body,” O’Brien suggests before giving her full description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You're essentially starting from the back—squeezing the rectum, squeezing the vagina muscles, then imagining your stopping a flow of urine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-8RiTVyVodKbLAfFcwfQDNb" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-8RiTVyVodKbLAfFcwfQDNb slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-long-should-you-hold-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How long should you hold pelvic floor squeezes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s pelvic floor strength is different, which means pelvic floor squeezes will be more challenging for some people than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three seconds will be effective for some people, but if you are particularly strong and active, you might need to look at a longer duration, such as 10 to 15 seconds,” says O’Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a general rule, you should be able to hold your pelvic floor for 10 seconds with a five second rest, and you should be able to do that 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It should never be uncomfortable.

But, it is important to stop and think which of them are actually beneficial. In a video shared on June 15, Dr Saurabh Sethi, MD (gastroenterology and hepatology), ranked 10 gut health trends for 2025 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest). Let's find out what he had to say: &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Cold potato or rice (Rating: 5)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi rated the popular trend of eating cold potato and rice for the resistant starch 5.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. L-glutamine supplements (Rating: 6)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut doctor rated L-glutamine supplements 6 on his list. But what are these supplements? According to &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320850" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Medical News Today"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, low L-glutamine levels may affect metabolism and gut health. Therefore, using the supplements often helps manage irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Additionally, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/glutamine" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="glutamine"&gt;glutamine &lt;/a&gt;helps strengthen the cell barrier that prevents your intestines from becoming damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Apple cider vinegar (Rating: 4)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist rated consuming apple cider vinegar (ACV) for gut health 4. Many studies suggest that ACV is consumed as it is a probiotic, and may introduce ‘good’ bacteria into your gut. However, according to a report by the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exploring-the-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Cleveland Clinic"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, most of these studies are small and need further research to support their claims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Intermittent fasting (Rating: 7)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi rated intermittent fasting 7 on his list. Per &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/The-Effect-of-Intermittent-Fasting-on-the-Gut-Microbiome.aspx#:~:text=Intermittent%20fasting%20benefits%20gut%20bacteria,gut%2Dhealthy%20diet%20and%20lifestyle." data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="News-Medical"&gt;News-Medical&lt;/a&gt;, intermittent fasting benefits gut bacteria because it gives them time for rest and repopulation, even though more research is necessary to define its precise advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Synbiotics (Rating: 8)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synbiotics are a mixture of prebiotics and probiotics. Dr Sethi rated them 8. Per a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/synbiotics#:~:text=A%20synbiotic%20is%20defined%20as,Interventions%20in%20Gastrointestinal%20Diseases%2C%202019" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="2019 study"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, they beneficially affect the host by improving the survival and activity of beneficial microorganisms in the gut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Carnivore diet (Rating: 3)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harvard-trained gut doctor rated the carnivore diet 3 on his list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Detox teas (Rating: 2)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For detox teas, Dr Sethi gave a 2 rating. According to him, detox tea trends are ‘overhyped’ and have minimal gut benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Parasite cleanse (Rating: 1)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He rated the parasite cleanse 1. According to the gut doctor, there is no evidence for the benefits of routine use of a parasite cleanse on the gut. What is a parasite cleanse? Per a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/parasite-cleanses#:~:text=Parasite%20cleanses%20claim%20that%20a,tests%20and%20proper%20medical%20treatment." data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="WebMD report"&gt;WebMD report&lt;/a&gt;, a parasite cleanse claims that a combination of supplements and diet can rid your body of parasites. Yet there is no evidence that any of these cleanses work, and some might cause dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. High fibre diets (Rating: 9)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet consists of fruits, legumes and seeds. Per Dr Sethi, a high fibre diet has a 9 rating. Per the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="National Institutes of Health (NIH)"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;, dietary fibre is beneficial as it is fermented by the human gut microbiota, producing beneficial microbial metabolites. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Fermented foods (Rating: 10)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he gave the highest rating (10) to fermented foods. Some examples of fermented foods are kefir and yoghurt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a baby, which means spending a lot of time on the couch recovering. While proper rest is crucial during the postpartum period, all this inactivity has resulted in stiffness and pain throughout my lower back, neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needing some gentle movement to open things up, I found this quick 10-minute full-body stretch from yoga instructor Francine Cipollone—better known on YouTube as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@YogaWithBird" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/@YogaWithBird" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Yoga with Bird&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked safe enough to do, even under my current activity restrictions.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only equipment you need is a yoga mat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cipollone takes you through several poses and mobility exercises, mostly done on your back and stomach. She moves through child’s pose and downward dog positions a few times, so keep that in mind if you have troublesome knees or wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-takeaways-after-doing-yoga-with-bird-s-10-minute-full-body-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My takeaways after doing Yoga with Bird’s 10-minute full-body stretch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This routine felt right for me, but you should always check in with your medical team before attempting any new workout—especially, if you’re postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried the stretch session all the way through and have given it a few more tries since. Here’s how I felt afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-NX2rKV44vkK7mcm2kjLRkf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-NX2rKV44vkK7mcm2kjLRkf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-lower-back-felt-great"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My lower back felt great&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with lower back pain since my teens. I was lucky that my pregnancy didn’t cause any severe flare ups, but three days in a hospital bed and three weeks on the couch have not been kind to my lumbar spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first moves Cipollone does is a figure four stretch for the hips. She takes this into a spinal rotation, which she holds for about a minute on each side. After this sequence, my back felt better instantly. I moved with a much improved range for the rest of the 10-minute program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-was-a-mental-health-boost"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a mental health boost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been the longest break I’ve taken from purposeful exercise, and while it’s been necessary, I’ve found it more mentally challenging than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting down on the mat and just stretching did wonders for my mental clarity and mood. The slow, concentrated movement, paired with Cipollone’s gentle verbal cues, allowed me to reconnect with my body and clear my head. When the routine was over, I felt refreshed, energized and calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-didn-t-need-to-modify-but-others-might"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t need to modify, but others might&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know plenty of people who struggle with lower back pain like I do, so I should mention that there are a few poses that could aggravate some existing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cippollone does a few mobility drills on her stomach and propped up on her forearms, which can sometimes cause pain and pressure in the lower back. The position felt comfortable for me, but you can always decrease the extension if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

He’s a big fan of early intervention and of being realistic, so he went to see a geriatrician, who gave him a battery of memory and skills tests, with tasks like count backwards from 100 by 7s. “I got to 93 and stopped. Who can even do that anyway?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;His geriatrician sent him for a bigger battery of tests with a psychologist and he was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That didn’t throw him, either. He started going in every year for testing to see how he was doing. Then two years ago, the doctor ordered a PET scan to see what his brain looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That was a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The day the results of the PET scan came back, he was alone in a hotel room in Montana, on a trip for his job selling medical devices. He looked online for his results and when he saw the words “consistent with Alzheimer’s,” he said that “I remember I kind of froze up, stuck my face in a pillow and screamed. I started to bawl. I was scared to death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He still had to call home and let the people he loved most know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Another scan a short time later confirmed the diagnosis: Alzheimer’s dementia. By then, the now 66-year-old South Jordan man had collected himself, strapped his sense of humor back in place and was ready to fight for time he still has with his family, connection to others and the life that he loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s the first thing he wants you to know. There’s life after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2026"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HIZF2SRS6JCBXMXFQICHXFCKR4.JPG?auth=a9904254df97490c6b001dd6490173c2b2a1a3bb0017344507cafeeb65c830fa&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=540" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HIZF2SRS6JCBXMXFQICHXFCKR4.JPG?auth=a9904254df97490c6b001dd6490173c2b2a1a3bb0017344507cafeeb65c830fa&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1080 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Lance Kocherhans, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is treating it with Leqembi, poses for a portrait at home in South Jordan on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="All-in-on-a-club-he-didn't-want-to-join" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;All in on a club he didn’t want to join&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jim Herlihy, a regional spokesman for the Alzheimer’s Association, will tell you that Kocherhans finds himself in good, if reluctant, company. About 7.4 million people in the U.S., including 38,300 in Utah, live with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While there’s no cure, recent years have brought those with Alzheimer’s some reason to hope that had long been missing. Studies have shown some steps people can take proactively and earlier in life that may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s or slow the disease’s progress. Herlihy said that “about 40% of all cases of Alzheimer’s can be influenced by our behaviors — one way or the other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And newish medications are beginning to impact the neurocognitive decline, slowing it down when taken early enough, though they don’t reverse what’s already been lost or halt the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah Alzheimer’s Association spokesman Jeremy Cunningham told Deseret News that two recent drugs are making a significant difference in the lives of some people with early-stage disease by slowing down their decline modestly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Kocherhans knows all of that. So he moved from being diagnosed to starting treatment without hesitation — after he got over a brief period of despondency. He mourned, then chose to pull himself out of the funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He loves his family, which includes his spouse, four children and 11 grandchildren. His kids are all nearby, including one who moved back to Utah to be part of whatever time Kocherhans has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="1958"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5PLCG55SRNFNLINBKSJ25H7E4M.JPG?auth=e88fd79757be076f211e742d0b3efa3d0fc93371daf616efbf6e8c434246e036&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=522" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5PLCG55SRNFNLINBKSJ25H7E4M.JPG?auth=e88fd79757be076f211e742d0b3efa3d0fc93371daf616efbf6e8c434246e036&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1044 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Lance Kocherhans, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is treating it with Leqembi, jokes around with his neighbor Stoney Fonua in Kocherhans’ yard in South Jordan on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He’d spent more than 35 years selling medical devices to hospital labs and had planned to retire at the end of last year anyway. When he got the news his condition had advanced to Alzheimer’s, he retired a few months early, determined to chase the things that were important to him, like time with family and treatment, travel and yard work — which he happens to love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Not-running-from-treatment" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Not running from treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;One of his first steps was arranging to start taking one of the newest drugs, Leqembi, which is made by Biogen. Given by an hour-long infusion, it reduces the amyloid plaques believed to be a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. But it’s only given in the early stages, which include mild cognitive impairment when symptoms don’t impact life much and the next phase, mild Alzheimer’s dementia, when symptoms such as trouble keeping track of finances and doing some familiar tasks are beginning to show. The &lt;a href="https://www.leqembi.com/-/media/Files/Leqembi/Patient-Brochure.pdf?hash=065f5e1c-0d0b-451f-86c2-0f16b19106c0" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.leqembi.com/-/media/Files/Leqembi/Patient-Brochure.pdf?hash=065f5e1c-0d0b-451f-86c2-0f16b19106c0"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; when people start getting lost and confused, “Leqembi may no longer be right for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The drug has been shown to push that day back for some people. But while it may buy someone with Alzheimer’s precious time, it won’t stop its progression. People also have to be willing to risk side effects, most often mild but sometimes serious. Kocherhans notes that he gets a little tired right after an infusion, but that’s about it. So he takes a nap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s another thing Lance Kocherhans wants people to know. There’s no point delaying diagnosis of a progressive disease like Alzheimer’s. Maximizing the quality of your time hinges on getting started with the tools that could help. They won’t be available later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He wasn’t wild about the needle sticks, though, so he had a port put in so that they can plug into that instead of him. One and done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Treatments are not inexpensive, although a Biogen spokesperson warns against listing any one patient’s out-of-pocket cost. The list price is about $26,500 a year, but it all depends on your insurance coverage, copay assistance and eligibility for other programs that lower cost. What people pay can vary a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Not-done-living" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Not done living&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Something else Kocherhans wants you to know? Life doesn’t end with diagnosis. He travels a lot with loved ones, and has planned trips in the next few months to Washington, D.C., and Costa Rica. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;One of the hardest things, he said, has been seeing what people post in support groups about caring for someone with dementia. Information is power, but he’s learned it can also be really sad. The disease impacts people differently and some people become mean and combative, as some of the posts chronicle. But that’s not everyone, he points out. He knows there’s great variation, because he’s cared for his dad and an in-law and others. They have all been different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He doesn’t know what personality changes lie in his future and that’s a worry. But he knows that he’s embracing life to its fullest right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He says he’s doing all right. He’s active physically, he sleeps well and wakes up rested, and he’s out and about a lot. He thinks there’s a chance Alzheimer’s is something he will die with, rather than of. He’s good with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="1946"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CA2UE5R2TBE7ZEJJ5BIUANR7HA.JPG?auth=e8aad73a3cf7234100594621679d37d48422f7eae031c7f6eb5fa2c418d023ef&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=518" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CA2UE5R2TBE7ZEJJ5BIUANR7HA.JPG?auth=e8aad73a3cf7234100594621679d37d48422f7eae031c7f6eb5fa2c418d023ef&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1036 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Lance Kocherhans, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is treating it with Leqembi, does yard work at home in South Jordan on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Do-what-you-can-and-start-early" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Do what you can and start early&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In honor of Alzheimer’s and Brain Health Awareness Month in June, the Alzheimer’s Association is circulating a 10-point list of proactive actions that people can take. The neurocognitive disease is the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S. and the numbers are expected to get worse. It’s the only leading disease without a clear prevention or cure, killing more Americans annually than breast and colon cancer combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The 40% that might be changed somewhat by lifestyle choices matters. Among the habits the association says everyone should develop: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break a sweat&lt;/b&gt;. Get the blood flowing to your brain and body, make your heart pump and build muscles. Plenty of research finds that physical activity could reduce risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continue to learn&lt;/b&gt;. Take a class online or study a language. Learn to play a musical instrument. Stretch and work your brain. The more you work it, the more that brain has to work with if there’s cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not smoke&lt;/b&gt;. It’s one of the worst things you can do if you want to avoid cognitive decline. If you smoke, quit. And like the other suggestions, it’s never too late to improve your odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your blood pressure top number below 135&lt;/b&gt;. A World Health Organization study found people with high blood pressure that’s not treated have a 36% higher risk of Alzheimer’s. If your blood pressure is high, consult a health care provider and do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid head injuries&lt;/b&gt;, which can raise the risk of cognitive decline. Wear a seatbelt, use a helmet when playing contact sports or riding a bike and prevent falls. Working on balance is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat a healthy diet that’s low in fat and high in vegetables and fruits&lt;/b&gt;. Some diets, such as the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean-DASH (it stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) are believed to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get good sleep and plenty of it&lt;/b&gt;. Insomnia, sleep apnea and other sleep-related problems are believed to harm cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you have diabetes, bring it under control&lt;/b&gt;. While researchers still debate the exact connection between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s, poorly controlled blood sugar is believed to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use your mind and stretch it&lt;/b&gt;. Exercise and stump your brain. The association said to build a piece of furniture, complete a puzzle, be artistic, play games that make you think strategically. The group notes that challenging your mind may have short- and long-term benefits for your brain. It’s not a tricky task. For instance, you can challenge your brain by brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand and taking different routes when you travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="1994"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HJI5ZQ44CNENLKKASFMBFLL5UA.JPG?auth=2d80fb4bf2cc56ef56468c7b6e78c3bdc38070183faf1c51cb5728b35d0f1475&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=531" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HJI5ZQ44CNENLKKASFMBFLL5UA.JPG?auth=2d80fb4bf2cc56ef56468c7b6e78c3bdc38070183faf1c51cb5728b35d0f1475&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1062 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Lance Kocherhans, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is treating it with Leqembi, works on a puzzle at home in South Jordan on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Finally, &lt;b&gt;mind your weight and keep it healthy&lt;/b&gt;. An analysis of multiple studies shows that obesity between the ages of 35 and 65 can increase dementia risk in later life by about 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s good to remember, too, that things that benefit the brain benefit the heart and body. It runs both ways. Do those things and you’ll be healthier overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Cunningham adds socializing to the to-do list. “People laugh at that, but not isolating is really, really important,” he said. Withdrawing also happens a lot with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He also notes that besides treatment advances, there have been diagnostic gains. For instance, a blood test can now bolster the search for the telltale signs of amyloid plaques. That, in conjunction with other tests, provides valuable diagnostic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The last thing Kocherhans wants you to know? Being afraid doesn’t help. So do what you can while you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2056"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/D6KRCKJFPFDIBAR535UNFIUJ2U.JPG?auth=7218c4b60fdaf856920f8a2bda10263d7f7ad37ce822d2a8614239cb29b41cdd&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=548" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/D6KRCKJFPFDIBAR535UNFIUJ2U.JPG?auth=7218c4b60fdaf856920f8a2bda10263d7f7ad37ce822d2a8614239cb29b41cdd&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1096 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Lance Kocherhans, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is treating it with Leqembi, poses for a portrait at home in South Jordan on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZGdTVmk5RHFyQjlacjAtU0NFb3B1LVdBQllqbU5uYlhUdzNidU9XOXVoZEZ0U1JxZDZqa2owLW1Ca3RaMmwxem9ELXZOYXdNbWVoMXZQYUdnZ0M1OXZfd2daYWpjcUtWaU16bndlZmh1ekE0WS02MVhqbTJjM0R0YTR5M1Y5LXdlTVluWnRtV1VUS3JaUG9vSFdPVjZNX2V1b1lnTVFKdGNfUQ</guid></item><item><title>“从内到外吞噬你”的致命真菌入侵美国： “成千上万的生命处于危险之中” -每日邮报 | Deadly fungus that 'eats you from the inside out' invades US: 'Hundreds of thousands of lives at risk' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lethal fungus that can rot human tissue from within is spreading rapidly across the US, and experts warn the problem could worsen as temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus is airborne and nearly impossible to avoid.

US hospitals have stepped up&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13146609/lab-killer-fungi-weapons-pandemic.html"&gt; mold inspections and antifungal protocols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aspergillus fungus is a toxic fungus that produces aflatoxin, one of the most powerful naturally occurring carcinogens. This can cause cancers and disorders of the lung, liver, spleen, stomach, colon and kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Co-author Norman van Rhijn, from the University of Manchester, told the Financial Times: 'We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 400,000 of these cases develop into chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, a long-term lung infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Invasive aspergillosis is less common but far deadlier. It mainly targets people with weakened immune systems and can spread from the lungs to the brain, heart, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2874071/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found only 59 percent of organ transplant patients survived a year after infection, and just 25 percent of stem cell transplant patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hospitalizations for invasive aspergillosis in the US rose about three percent annually from 2000 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2014, nearly 15,000 hospital stays were recorded, costing an estimated $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ICU autopsies show aspergillosis ranks among the top four infections likely to cause death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization lists Aspergillus fumigatus as a 'critical priority' fungal threat due to rising drug resistance and high death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fungus thrives in warm, damp environments, even surviving temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit in compost piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Close up of Aspergillus oryzae is a filamentous fungus, or mold that is used in food production, such as in soybean fermentation for education in laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Climate change is making it easier for the fungus to survive inside the human body as global temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study conducted by &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1"&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt; found that if fossil fuel use continues at current levels, the fungus could expand by more than 75 percent by 2100, putting millions more at risk in the southern US, where conditions mirror those forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Azole drugs, widely used to treat fungal infections in humans, are also heavily applied in agriculture to protect crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn this overuse may be driving drug resistance, which can transfer from the environment to humans and reduce treatment effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01782-23"&gt; Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, found azole-resistant, Aspergillus fumigatus in farm soil across at least seven US states, with many strains resistant to standard antifungal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists warn the mixing of different fungal types is speeding resistance spread and suggests the problem is already deeply rooted in US soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO urges immediate investment in safer drugs, faster testing, and better training for health workers, while calling on drug companies to prioritize fungal research and include children in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This isn't science fiction,' said Dr Vyas, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University.

Fruits offer numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, improving digestion, and providing essential vitamins and minerals. They are a good source of fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients, all of which contribute to overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, from all the good press fruits have, we tend to deem fruit juices as a good alternative to raw fruits as well. In fact, in the pursuit of health, fruit juices often seem like a wholesome choice—packed with vitamins and antioxidants, and also, incredibly tasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, turns out, when it comes to liver health, that healthy and tasty glass of juice might be doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The liver's role and the impact of excessive sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a vital organ responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and storing energy. A healthy liver is vital for overall well-being, playing a key role in digestion, waste removal, and blood clotting. Maintaining liver health involves a combination of lifestyle choices, including a balanced diet, moderate alcohol consumption, and avoiding toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the liver processes everything we consume, including sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fructose, a sugar found in fruits, is metabolized in the liver. While small amounts are manageable, excessive intake can overwhelm the liver's capacity, leading to fat accumulation and liver inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyzing data from over half a million people across multiple continents, researchers at Brigham Young University recently found something unexpected: that sugar consumed through drinks like soda—and even pure fruit juice, which is high in naturally occurring fructose—appeared to be more harmful than sugar that is eaten in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Della Corte, lead author and BYU nutritional science professor, said in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.byu.edu/intellect/rethinking-sugar-byu-study-shows-food-source-is-key-to-understanding-diabetes-risk" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, “This is the first study to draw clear dose-response relationships between different sugar sources and Type 2 diabetes risk,” adding, “It highlights why drinking your sugar—whether from soda or juice—is more problematic for health than eating it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the study, with each additional eight-ounce serving of fruit juice per day—including 100% fruit juice, nectars, and juice drinks—the risk for developing T2D (Type 2 diabetes) increased by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruit Juices: a concentrated source of sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike whole fruits, fruit juices lack fiber, which helps slow sugar absorption. A single glass of fruit juice can contain the sugar equivalent of several pieces of fruit, leading to a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. This sudden influx of sugar forces the liver to work overtime, increasing the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hence, while fruit juices are often perceived as healthy, their high sugar content and potential additives can pose risks to liver health when consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The link between fruit juice and liver disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown a correlation between high consumption of fruit juices and an increased risk of NAFLD. For instance, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37543090/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; involving over 136,000 participants found that a higher intake of pure fruit juice was associated with a higher risk of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of artificial sweeteners&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about sugary fruits. Packed cartons of fruit juice contain way more than just fructose. Commercially available fruit juices contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners to enhance flavor and taste profile. These additives can further exacerbate liver strain. Some artificial sweeteners have been linked to liver toxicity and metabolic disturbances, compounding the negative effects on liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is that no fruit juice, safe enough for the liver?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there is an exception indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;It’s the grapefruit juice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grapefruit juice is known to interact with various medications by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4, which is involved in drug metabolism. This interaction can lead to higher levels of certain drugs in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of side effects and liver toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the solution then?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not necessary to eliminate fruit juices entirely, moderation is key to maintaining a crucial balance between health and taste. Being mindful of juice intake and opting for whole fruits can support liver function and overall well-being. If you choose to consume fruit juice, opt for freshly squeezed varieties without added sugars and limit intake to small amounts. Pairing juice with a balanced diet rich in whole fruits, vegetables, and fiber can help mitigate potential risks to liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 01:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>4种可能加重脂肪肝疾病的夏季食品和饮料- VnExpress International | 4 summer foods and drinks that may worsen fatty liver disease - VnExpress International</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOR3I0dkdmR3dZcmdWU1EwVGw0S0ZMUUg4a3lvc3N5dnBWSnN4V2RsNEdFZDVLdGhQai13VVNXQWRYcWk5c2VYVzM2UXhFb1ROaU1IR1g2X2tzSFgxSmE4V3dCWm13czJhMnRyNWJTU3NwOG5rTGJ4Qm9mM25BT1RvNzZqZHFtdEhJUTZSandVcWFjRXBhbHUyRXhTNjR2ZUt4ZUgxMVN1OFNjSzZrcjVvQndoNEF6MHJa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="fck_detail"&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Fatty liver occurs when fat accumulates in liver cells and exceeds 5% of the organ’s weight, causing it to enlarge and impair its function. If inflammation develops, the condition can progress to more serious liver diseases such as cirrhosis or liver cancer if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to Dr. Vu Truong Khanh, Head of the Gastroenterology Department at Tam Anh General Hospital in Hanoi, diet plays a crucial role in the development and management of fatty liver. Avoiding certain high-risk foods during the summer can help protect liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Below are four common summer favorites that people with or at risk of fatty liver disease should limit in the summer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Beer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;As temperatures rise, many turn to beer for refreshment. However, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and eventually cirrhosis. The liver is responsible for breaking down alcohol and removing it from the body, but overconsumption can overwhelm its capacity and result in long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to Dr. Khanh, men under 65 with no liver disease limit alcohol intake to no more than three standard drinks per day, or 21 per week. For women and men over 65, the limit drops to two drinks per day and no more than 14 per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;One standard drink contains 14 grams of pure alcohol — roughly the amount in a 330ml bottle of 5% beer, a 150ml glass of 13.5% wine, or a 40ml shot of 40% spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. High-sugar beverages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Popular among younger consumers, carbonated soft drinks and &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/is-coffee-or-green-tea-better-for-your-liver-health-4891329.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;bubble tea&lt;/a&gt; are packed with sugar. Regular consumption of these sweetened beverages increases the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Bubble tea in clear glass jars.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;A single can of soda typically contains around 39 grams of sugar—about eight teaspoons. Liquid sugar causes rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can lead to mood swings, increased hunger, and cravings. In response, the body releases more insulin, prompting the liver to convert the excess sugar into fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Sugar substitutes, often advertised as healthier, don’t effectively help with weight or fat control. In fact, long-term use may contribute to health issues such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Khanh explained that the body absorbs sugar in three forms: monosaccharides (simple sugars like fructose), disaccharides (table sugar), and polysaccharides (complex carbs found in rice, grains, and tubers). Carbohydrates should make up 55–65% of total daily energy, with complex carbs accounting for about 70% of total sugar intake. Simple and table sugars should contribute less than 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Sweet desserts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Traditional summer treats like sweet soups, ice cream, and cakes are &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/4-worst-foods-for-liver-health-4890060.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;high in sugar and fat&lt;/a&gt;—two key contributors to obesity and fatty liver. Cakes made with refined flour are particularly concerning, as they are harder to digest and can promote fat accumulation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Heavily seasoned snacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Street food favorites often feature strong spices or salty condiments such as chili or salt. Regular consumption of spicy or heavily seasoned foods—especially those containing ginger, garlic, chili, or pepper—can stress an already weakened liver.

I will see you again, son.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meningococcemia, or meningococcal septicemia, is caused from Neisseria meningitidis bacteria which had entered the teen's bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it is very hard to save the person who is infected with the bacteria,' Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/2025/06/13/14-year-old-greenville-dies-bacterial-infection/"&gt;Fox Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is spread through saliva or respiratory secretions, and can be transferred from person to person through close contact or sharing items such as drinks or utensils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William Hand, 14, tragically succumbed to a rare blood infection known as Meningococcemia on June 8 only days after catching the fast moving illness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The recent eight grade Hughes Academy of Science and Technology graduate woke up before 5am and was 'clearly not well,' his dad Will Hand said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Meningococcemia, or meningococcal septicemia, is caused from Neisseria meningitidis bacteria which had entered the teen's bloodstream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Burch stressed that, while aggressive, the disease is uncommon and not always fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, sensitivity to light, nausea, or vomiting. It can also cause a rash that does not fade when pressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We call it a petechial rash because it looks like broken blood vessels underneath the skin,' Burch told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s not a typically rash that you would get with let’s say, a viral infection. If you put your finger on it and press down really hard, the rash will stay there.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Department of Public Health reported 12 cases of the illness in South Carolina in the past 1.5 years, four of which resulted in death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for DHEC told the outlet: 'DPH investigates all reported cases of Neisseria meningitidis, looking for possible links. In regards to the 12 cases spread across the state within 18 months, no links were found and this does not fit the definition of an outbreak.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most effective preventative action against Meningococcemia is vaccination, according to The Centers for Disease Control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hand is remembered as 'the highlight of many people's day-equal parts athlete, comedian, music lover, and loyal friend.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The disease is spread through saliva or respiratory secretions, and can be transferred from person to person through close contact or sharing items such as drinks or utensils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The little league baseball player was described by his team, Greenville Little League, as 'more than just a great competitor—he was a loyal friend, devoted son and brother, and a true teammate in every sense'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, sensitivity to light, nausea, or vomiting.

But when done right, a low-carb lifestyle can be one of the most powerful tools for improving metabolic health, energy and body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the biggest myths — and what science actually says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. You need carbs for energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a common myth — and one of the most misleading. Yes, your body can use carbs for energy, but it doesn't require them. Once adapted, your metabolism becomes highly efficient at using fat and ketones for fuel — especially during long-duration activity or fasting periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fat is the body's largest and most reliable energy reserve. When you train your metabolism to use it efficiently, you unlock a level of endurance and energy stability that carbs alone can't offer," said Joel Bikman, a long-time nutrition executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fat-adapted state also supports steady blood sugar and improved mental clarity — benefits that go beyond athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Low-carb means no carbs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-carb doesn't mean zero-carb. It simply means reducing refined sugars and starches — not eliminating all carbohydrates. In fact, most low-carb diets encourage nutrient-dense carbs from sources like leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, avocados, and even berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal isn't to eliminate an entire macronutrient group, it's to prioritize quality over quantity. By focusing on fiber-rich, low-glycemic options, you get the benefits of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, without the blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A well-formulated low-carb diet isn't restrictive — it's refined," Bikman said. "It weeds out the junk and prioritizes nutrient-dense foods your body actually thrives on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. You'll feel awful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people may experience "keto flu," rest assured that it's temporary. As your body shifts from burning sugar to burning fat, it can experience symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, or irritability for a few days. This is your metabolism recalibrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adaptation isn't a sign something is wrong — it's a sign something is changing," Bikman said. "Hydration, electrolytes, and adequate fat intake can all ease the adjustment period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've made the transition, though, most people report dramatically improved energy, reduced hunger, better mood stability, and even clearer thinking. Many say they've never felt better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Julia/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. It's bad for athletes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, conventional wisdom said athletes needed to carb-load for peak performance. But more recent research — especially in endurance sports — is changing that narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some high-intensity athletes may benefit from strategic carbohydrate use, many endurance athletes (cyclists, ultramarathoners, triathletes) report improved stamina and fat oxidation on a low-carb or ketogenic approach. Some even see VO₂ max improvements — a key marker of aerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flexible metabolism that can switch between fuel sources is now seen as a performance advantage, not a liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. You can't eat fruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth comes from a misunderstanding of the meaning of "low-glycemic." While many fruits are high in sugar, not all fruits are off-limits on a low-carb plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries — especially raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries — are low in net carbs and packed with antioxidants. Other low-sugar options like kiwi, starfruit, and small portions of melon can also fit in, depending on your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. It's just another diet fad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low-carb diet isn't some Silicon Valley startup trend — it's grounded in decades of scientific research. Studies have consistently shown that low-carb and ketogenic diets improve blood sugar regulation, reduce insulin levels, aid in weight loss, and support better lipid profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The low-carb approach isn't a passing trend," Bikman said. "It's a proven therapeutic tool with decades of data behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Diabetes Association recognizes low-carb eating as a valid therapy for managing type 2 diabetes. That's not a fad — that's clinical validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. It's too restrictive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, many people find low-carb less restrictive than calorie counting. Why? Because it naturally curbs cravings, stabilizes appetite, and emphasizes real, satisfying food. When you're not on a blood sugar rollercoaster all day, eating becomes simpler and more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about eating less," Bikman said. "It's about eating smarter. Low-carb helps people reclaim control over their hunger and their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A big boost to low-carb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, we all would have the knowledge, time, discipline and budget to plan, purchase and prepare perfect low-carb meals," Bikman said. "But it simply doesn't happen; people get busy, they get stressed and they make unhealthy choices that derail their health goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman knew that he and his team could be part of the solution to help people achieve their best health more quickly, and especially to assist those that don't always have the time, knowledge or discipline to eat healthy. In response, Bikman and his co-founding team of metabolic, nutrition and industry experts created &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says these carefully formulated meal shakes are designed to promote healthy weight management, gut health, brain health, even hair, skin and nail health. HLTH Code Complete Meal features an optimized, science-backed blend of protein, collagen, healthy fats, apple cider vinegar, probiotics, fiber, vitamins and minerals — with no added sugar or any artificial ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HLTH Code Complete Meal is based on research, not fads," Bikman said. "An incredible amount of work went into making this nutritionally balanced and optimized, yet we knew that if it didn't taste good, no one would use them consistently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delicious and convenient&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each HLTH Code Complete Meal shake is packed with optimized amounts of low-carb ingredients to leave you feeling full and energized for hours," said Bikman. "Yet it's more convenient and affordable than virtually any meal you could make or buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says the shakes are quick and easy to make: Just add two scoops of Creamy Vanilla or Chocolate Macadamia Complete Meal Powder to 8 oz. of cold water and shake or blend. For general wellness, he recommends replacing one meal daily. To reset your health or for weight loss, replace up to two meals per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[I've] been using HLTH Code for about two weeks and I feel healthier, having more energy and having less cravings - love this product!!!" wrote &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/reviews/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;one reviewer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reviewer shares, "I started losing weight quickly because I have found that I no longer eat between meals, I do not 'crave' carbs and I'm automatically doing intermittent fasting, not purposely but because I just don't get hungry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet another reviewer shares, "The results have been phenomenal! Thank you HLTH Code. The shakes are yummy but the weight loss results are miraculous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making low-carb easier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bikman, the best health starts with the right blend of nutrition. Increased energy; feeling more vibrant; a stronger immune system; a clearer mind; improved gut health; and an improved appearance are some of the benefits from improving one's nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The comprehensive benefits of HLTH Code Complete Meal are especially helpful if you're trying to lose weight," Bikman said. "Weight loss is rarely easy. There has to be the right changes in both hormones and caloric balance to signal to the body that it's time to start burning, not storing, fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman added that based on the best available studies on human metabolism, along with exercise, HLTH Code helps people lose weight without the need for counting every calorie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your satisfaction is guaranteed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're nervous about trying something new and making changes to your nutrition plan, don't be.

&lt;p&gt;Although most people consume too much salt, some conditions require more salt. However, before increasing your salt intake, Khera emphasized that “these are specialized conditions that require specific expertise,” and that no one should increase their salt intake before having “explicit discussions with their doctor.” The following conditions may require adding salt to one’s diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthostatic hypotension. &lt;/strong&gt;Khera explained that if people have low blood pressure when standing up, or orthostatic hypotension, they may need more salt. When a patient is diagnosed with this condition — one variation of which is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome — doctors “sometimes recommend salt to retain more fluid in the body and have fewer dizzy or loss-of-consciousness spells,” Khera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-performance athletes.&lt;/strong&gt; Khera explained that high-performance athletes may lose a lot of salt via sweat, especially if they are training or competing in hot climates. However, he noted that “this is rarely needed,” and that when it is, “modest increases are sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cystic fibrosis.&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with cystic fibrosis lose salt through their sweat more than those without the condition, Khera said. That means they “often require an increase in intake in salt,” although the amount of additional salt each person needs varies and is determined by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addison’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt; According to Batiste, “People with Addison’s disease, a condition affecting the adrenal glands, may experience low levels of sodium.” Health care providers may recommend increased salt intake to maintain electrolyte balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrolyte abnormalities. &lt;/strong&gt;Some electrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood sodium or hyponatremia, are treated with increased sodium intake.

Here, neurologists reveal the silent dementia sign that's often overlooked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-way-to-protect-cognition-according-to-science" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thousands of Experts Agree That This Is the #1 Best Way To Keep Your Mind Sharp;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thousands of Experts Agree That This Is the #1 Best Way To Keep Your Mind Sharp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The No. 1 Overlooked Sign of Dementia, Neurologists Warn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurologists warn that apathy is a silent sign of dementia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Apathy, or the loss of goal-directed thought and behavior, is one of the earliest signs in some types of dementia, especially frontotemporal dementia, but it’s often overlooked because it doesn’t manifest as active distress," Dr. Aziz says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike forgetting how to get home, Dr. Aziz explains that people often mask apathy as preference for solo time, tiredness, shyness or natural aging. "A person who once planned outings or made social calls may simply stop engaging," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sadly, loved ones may feel silently hurt by the changes. "It can appear that the person does not care or is depressed when this is not the case," points out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/amodeo-katherine-d.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Katherine D.

Dr. Amodeo shares that the chemical changes and cell losses in parts of the brain associated with motivation can impact a person's desire to participate in activities they once loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://remo.health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Daniel Lesley, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Daniel Lesley, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified neurologist at Remo Health, says situational factors may also contribute to apathy. "Individuals may feel that everything is so much harder, making it seem 'not worth the effort,'" he explains. "Additionally, they might feel 'useless' or like 'a burden.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Amodeo, apathy is associated with several types of dementia, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewy body dementia (LBD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apathy's place as a symptom of that fourth one, frontotemporal dementia, has gotten more attention lately. Frontotemporal dementia is often diagnosed early (between the ages of 45 and 65). A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12252" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; indicated that apathy could predict frontotemporal dementia years before symptoms start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It may be more commonly associated with frontotemporal dementia because those with this disease typically show changes in personality or mood as an early feature [because of] the function of the frontal lobe of the brain—the part of the brain disproportionately impacted in frontotemporal dementia," Dr. Amodeo says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers also note that apathy predicted a faster decline. "Apathy may be associated with a faster decline in function, because it reduces the person’s ability to adapt and cope with their decreased function," Dr. Lesley explains. "Also, it takes away some of the situations that tend to support cognitive health—social activities, exercise, cognitive activities like reading, and getting adequate nutrition and good sleep."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/food-to-eat-every-day-for-sharp-memory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People in Their 90s With a Sharp Memory Eat This One Food Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People in Their 90s With a Sharp Memory Eat This One Food Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common Signs of Apathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lesley explains that apathy is not a condition but rather a description of a feeling, or lack thereof. He reveals that common signs of apathy include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of interest or joy in things that used to be fun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less motivation to do things (even those that are important for survival, like paying bills or eating)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less Goal-directed activity can all be associated with apathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of motivation to participate in self-care, including personal and home hygiene (not brushing teeth or cleaning the home)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, neurologists say it's important to understand that apathy has &lt;em&gt;numerous&lt;/em&gt; triggers. If you or a loved one is experiencing apathy, it may not be dementia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/living/phrases-unhappy-people-use-without-realizing-it-according-to-psychologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 Common Phrases Unhappy People Often Use Without Realizing It, Psychologists Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;16 Common Phrases Unhappy People Often Use Without Realizing It, Psychologists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Just because a person seems apathetic, they may not necessarily have dementia or be at risk for dementia," Dr. Amodeo says. "It can be observed in other [conditions], such as depression. A diagnosis of dementia would not be based on having this one feature alone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Dr. Amodeo, additional symptoms that signify that the apathy might be connected to dementia include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradual and progressive changes in cognitive function, including memory, language, attention and focus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hallucinations or delusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep changes, such as insomnia or dream enactment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in confusion or alertness (Dr. Amodeo explains a person might be confused later in the day, which is called "sundowning")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood or personality changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/behavior-sleep-change-dementia-study-april-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Subtle Behavior Change Could Be an Early Sign of Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Subtle Behavior Change Could Be an Early Sign of Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What To Do if You're Concerned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say speaking to a primary care physician is a great start. If they're concerned about cognitive decline, they'll order testing to learn more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Carlisle notes that there is no cure for dementia, but there is hope. "There are medications aimed at treating the symptoms," she explains. "There are a number of lifestyle modifications that can slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shares that these shifts include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular moderate-level exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participating in socially and cognitively engaging activities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting high-quality sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating vision and hearing issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dementia diagnosis can be hard on someone (and worsen apathy). Additionally, apathy may be a sign of a mental health condition exclusively. Either way, Dr. Amodeo shares that you deserve support for your mental well-being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I would recommend reaching out to their provider, such as their primary care provider, who may refer them to a psychiatrist or psychologist," she says, adding that Psychology Today is a good resource for finding therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-lower-dementia-risk-according-to-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: These 6 Simple Lifestyle Tweaks Can Lower Dementia Risk by 18%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: These 6 Simple Lifestyle Tweaks Can Lower Dementia Risk by 18%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-dementia-symptom-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom Most People Don't Realize Could Be a Dementia Sign, According to Neurologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom Most People Don't Realize Could Be a Dementia Sign, According to Neurologists&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jun 15, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-dementia-symptom-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jun 15, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 22:24:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9pVkNMeERVaTY4ekl2T2Fnc0VWR2s0TjBZbDNJQk1RWjJFS19hMU5TSUhEbnRTNEsydmlEWnhLSjR1ZGExWlhWeHdYZUwyZERVWHh2emdwc2hFcjF6akV4OFhGVUlZa1Fwb2lfWGVkZExocHpf</guid></item><item><title>无酒精啤酒“增加糖尿病和肥胖风险” ，研究表明-《每日邮报》 | Alcohol-free beer 'raises diabetes and obesity risks', research suggests - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

The drinks led to a build-up of insulin in the blood, another warning sign that diabetes could set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And levels of harmful cholesterol and triglycerides – blood fats linked with heart disease – also rose with some types of no or low-alcohol beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many also have a high calorie content, which can raise the risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pub sales of alcohol-free beers hit a record 120million pints in 2023, up 14 per cent from the previous year and a huge 77.8 per cent increase since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The steep rise reflects a marked change in drinking habits, with more and more Britons opting to avoid alcohol in favour of 'healthier' alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is little doubt this approach is better than heavy alcohol consumption for health, the latest study suggests no-alcohol beers are far from harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sales are booming and demand for alcohol-free beers is higher than it has ever been. But now research suggests they are not exactly the health boost many people hope. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that drinking two bottles a day is enough to drive up blood sugar levels – increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drinks led to a build-up of insulin in the blood, another warning sign that diabetes could set in. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists from Germany and the US followed 44 healthy young men who drank either two 330ml bottles of alcohol-free beer or water every day for four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had regular blood tests to monitor how it affected their bodies. The results, in the journal Nutrients, showed a worrying effect on cardiovascular health. The dangers were greater with booze-free wheat beers and so-called 'mixed beers' – which are often flavoured with orange or lemon soda. Lighter Pilsner-type beers stripped of alcohol, or with a maximum 0.5 per cent alcohol content, were slightly less damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a report on their findings researchers said: 'Non-alcoholic beer is increasingly consumed as an alternative to alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the benefits and risks are not yet known. We found they have an unfavourable effect on metabolism, mainly driven by their calorie and sugar content.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"A person who once planned outings or made social calls may simply stop engaging," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sadly, loved ones may feel silently hurt by the changes. "It can appear that the person does not care or is depressed when this is not the case," points out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/amodeo-katherine-d.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Katherine D.

Dr. Amodeo shares that the chemical changes and cell losses in parts of the brain associated with motivation can impact a person's desire to participate in activities they once loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://remo.health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Daniel Lesley, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Daniel Lesley, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified neurologist at Remo Health, says situational factors may also contribute to apathy. "Individuals may feel that everything is so much harder, making it seem 'not worth the effort,'" he explains. "Additionally, they might feel 'useless' or like 'a burden.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Amodeo, apathy is associated with several types of dementia, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Apathy's place as a symptom of that fourth one, frontotemporal dementia, has gotten more attention lately. Frontotemporal dementia is often diagnosed early (between the ages of 45 and 65). A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12252" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; indicated that apathy could predict frontotemporal dementia years before symptoms start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It may be more commonly associated with frontotemporal dementia because those with this disease typically show changes in personality or mood as an early feature [because of] the function of the frontal lobe of the brain—the part of the brain disproportionately impacted in frontotemporal dementia," Dr. Amodeo says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers also note that apathy predicted a faster decline. "Apathy may be associated with a faster decline in function, because it reduces the person’s ability to adapt and cope with their decreased function," Dr. Lesley explains. "Also, it takes away some of the situations that tend to support cognitive health—social activities, exercise, cognitive activities like reading, and getting adequate nutrition and good sleep."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/people-90s-sharp-memory-eat-162500110.html" data-ylk="slk:People in Their 90s With a Sharp Memory Eat This One Food Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;People in Their 90s With a Sharp Memory Eat This One Food Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Common Signs of Apathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lesley explains that apathy is not a condition but rather a description of a feeling, or lack thereof. He reveals that common signs of apathy include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Loss of interest or joy in things that used to be fun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Less motivation to do things (even those that are important for survival, like paying bills or eating)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Less Goal-directed activity can all be associated with apathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Loss of motivation to participate in self-care, including personal and home hygiene (not brushing teeth or cleaning the home)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, neurologists say it's important to understand that apathy has &lt;em&gt;numerous&lt;/em&gt; triggers. If you or a loved one is experiencing apathy, it may not be dementia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/16-common-phrases-unhappy-people-004000724.html" data-ylk="slk:16 Common Phrases Unhappy People Often Use Without Realizing It, Psychologists Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;16 Common Phrases Unhappy People Often Use Without Realizing It, Psychologists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Just because a person seems apathetic, they may not necessarily have dementia or be at risk for dementia," Dr. Amodeo says. "It can be observed in other [conditions], such as depression. A diagnosis of dementia would not be based on having this one feature alone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Dr. Amodeo, additional symptoms that signify that the apathy might be connected to dementia include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gradual and progressive changes in cognitive function, including memory, language, attention and focus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hallucinations or delusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep changes, such as insomnia or dream enactment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in confusion or alertness (Dr. Amodeo explains a person might be confused later in the day, which is called "sundowning")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mood or personality changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/subtle-behavior-change-could-early-142500456.html" data-ylk="slk:This Subtle Behavior Change Could Be an Early Sign of Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;This Subtle Behavior Change Could Be an Early Sign of Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What To Do if You're Concerned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say speaking to a primary care physician is a great start. If they're concerned about cognitive decline, they'll order testing to learn more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Carlisle notes that there is no cure for dementia, but there is hope. "There are medications aimed at treating the symptoms," she explains. "There are a number of lifestyle modifications that can slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She shares that these shifts include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regular moderate-level exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Following a Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participating in socially and cognitively engaging activities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Getting high-quality sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Treating vision and hearing issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A dementia diagnosis can be hard on someone (and worsen apathy). Additionally, apathy may be a sign of a mental health condition exclusively. Either way, Dr. Amodeo shares that you deserve support for your mental well-being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I would recommend reaching out to their provider, such as their primary care provider, who may refer them to a psychiatrist or psychologist," she says, adding that Psychology Today is a good resource for finding therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/six-lifestyle-changes-lower-dementia-162500916.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: These 6 Simple Lifestyle Tweaks Can Lower Dementia Risk by 18%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: These 6 Simple Lifestyle Tweaks Can Lower Dementia Risk by 18%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-dementia-symptom-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom Most People Don't Realize Could Be a Dementia Sign, According to Neurologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Silent Symptom Most People Don't Realize Could Be a Dementia Sign, According to Neurologists&lt;/a&gt;

                                        With Robert F. Kennedy at the helm of the nation's health agencies, alternative therapies are finding their way more often into the spotlight, including one familiar from the pandemic: ivermectin. Republican lawmakers in multiple states are now pushing bills that would allow for the antiparasitic to be sold over the counter, and four states already boast such a law: Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho, and Louisiana, report &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ivermectin-over-counter-pharmacy-states-rfk-jr-rcna205616"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/ivermectin-louisiana-law/article_e7dac5b2-f9cb-4e21-965a-6d917e38e9ab.html"&gt;NOLA&lt;/a&gt;. The move to make ivermectin OTC doesn't come without controversy: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug began as a veterinary med in the '70s, before being approved by the FDA to use for serious tropical diseases like river blindness, as well as scabies, tapeworms, and other worm-linked illnesses.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;FDA:&lt;/strong&gt; The agency hasn't given the green light for ivermectin to be used as a COVID preventive measure or treatment, and clinical trials haven't offered evidence that ivermectin does the trick on either of those fronts. The FDA has warned that ivermectin could interact with other meds, and that ODs can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, seizures, and even death.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

"This stuff works, man," Gibson said, per the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/ivermectin-cancer-cure-antivaxers-fbbqpm86g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of London.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;More bills: &lt;/strong&gt;GOP lawmakers in at least a dozen other states are trying to jump-start their own related legislation, including in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and West Virginia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Access: &lt;/strong&gt;The ivermectin would likely remain behind the pharmacist's counter, even if one doesn't need an Rx to buy it. Some pharmacists are also wary at using the drug off-label for illnesses and conditions it hasn't been approved for. One Idaho pharmacist tells NBC that he won't sell it to just anyone until the FDA weighs in with more guidance, despite his state recently approving ivermectin for OTC status.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Merck:&lt;/strong&gt; The company that manufactures ivermectin in the US says in a statement that the medication should only be used as the FDA directs it to be used, noting, "The use of ivermectin is not supported beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information."&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much more &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ivermectin-over-counter-pharmacy-states-rfk-jr-rcna205616"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; on the controversy.

However, elephants, whales and other large animals tend to have lower cancer rates than humans, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/this-gene-stops-elephants-from-getting-cancer-can-it-help-human-cancer-research/" target="_blank" title="https://bgr.com/science/this-gene-stops-elephants-from-getting-cancer-can-it-help-human-cancer-research/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;BGR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2456041" target="_blank" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2456041" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;In a 2015 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt; reported that researchers discovered that elephants possess 19 extra copies of the TP53 gene, a powerful cancer-stopping gene that acts as a genetic safeguard by detecting DNA damage and triggering cell death in potentially cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This genetic advantage likely explains elephants' low cancer rates despite their size, according to &lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/cancer-prevalence-across-vertebrate-species-decreases-with-gestation-time-may-increase-with-adult-mass/" target="_blank" title="https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/cancer-prevalence-across-vertebrate-species-decreases-with-gestation-time-may-increase-with-adult-mass/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt; reported expanded this research to nearly 300 animal species, analyzing over 16,000 necropsy records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that elephants are not unique in their cancer resistance. Many other species including some birds, bats and lizards, also exhibit low cancer levels, while animals like ferrets and opossums have higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlighted that larger body mass was linked to a slightly higher cancer risk, though not as strongly as anticipated, &lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications for human cancer research are significant, according to &lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While humans have only two copies of the TP53 gene, understanding how elephants and other species bolster their cancer defenses could lead to new treatments that enhance human cell resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BGR reported that researchers hope mimicking or boosting the effects of this gene could help develop therapies to reduce cancer incidence or slow its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 20:52:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAJBVV95cUxPRmkzRUJoMWpGVlNqblZCZTlRTmtfUHpPVXVxNWJSMERBbEdabjl5X3IyVjAzdHFUakZnVDBBQzVBdzFvRHo0SVpBSk95UTlfTjFhcHc5YlRGMGNMV0pqNDluT3FPQkl6TnI3TjVTSXVySkdpOTZXR1dsOXNJczVMb3N5XzRtXzg2MEQ1b3BhUVlyS0ZLLTNLWnp3RnZMclBQb2lKSElGOWE1ZV9rVlhpZ2VlQVVrWFNmUkl1N1ItOXY5VWJLbXNod2cwQk1VVFYxRjRmSjFFVXdJdG94LU1DSUp0TndsLUNjN0VsMzJpSmk1bndWM1hJQ00xOUdvdU96dmVhN05GdTlCWURoZHg3c0RrUVdMcV96bEowTnZsUjRHRGs4ZEJ1UjRqR1p4b1ktaEZ1TkhWZEE</guid></item><item><title>葡萄酒的隐藏化学：是什么塑造了葡萄酒的质地？ - Earth.com | Hidden chemistry of wine: What actually shapes its texture? - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOemcxazlWY09ISmUtSFVZTElJQ2RUTGYxTnBVMnctQmwyOUhkTmhOUUpBX2U3T2pSSTNEVzJYX1FzZVlvbHliOTA5OFFCQU1HN2ZRYVdBcGhWQVpLQnlyaG1Hbi1xUXVhWTN6TVh0VVZpQU9rQXY3YUplVE9vRGpaV1BZbzRDZkd4YXZLcG5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a sip of cabernet and your tongue might feel as if it’s being scraped by coarse paper, while another vintage wine may glide across your mouth. According to chemists, this contrast in wine texture isn’t just about how much tannin is present, but rather the exact molecular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wines-may-develop-new-tastes-as-climate-patterns-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; of the tannins themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40377541/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Condensed Tannin Fragmentation Fingerprinting method&lt;/a&gt; tags every tannin fragment as it shatters inside a high‑resolution &lt;a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/technology-areas/what-mass-spectrometry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mass spectrometer&lt;/a&gt;. The method transforms an invisible chemical jumble into a sortable library of flavor clues that winemakers can read like sheet music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peer‑reviewed study was directed by &lt;a href="https://foodscience.psu.edu/directory/mtk5407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misha Kwasniewski&lt;/a&gt;, associate research professor of fermented beverage science and technology at &lt;a href="https://agsci.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tannins-affect-wine-texture"&gt;Tannins affect wine texture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12111099/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Procyanidins&lt;/a&gt; are branched chains of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/flavanols" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flavanol catechin&lt;/a&gt; that can run from two to well over a dozen units, and the twists, bonds, and branching angles within those chains set how tightly the molecules clamp onto salivary proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer, more entangled chains strip away lubrication faster, so the same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-grapes-became-wine-in-italy-over-7000-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; family can create either a silky glide or a chalky drag across the gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tannins bind those proteins, the resulting complexes lose solubility and scatter light – roughening tissue surfaces and amplifying the tactile signal drinkers describe as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34796497/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;astringency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The familiar sensation is therefore less about tongue chemistry than about the mechanical friction created once saliva’s slip layer has been thinned out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mixtures-of-taste-and-touch"&gt;Mixtures of taste and touch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitterness rides a different sensory pathway, relying on taste‑bud receptors that respond to specific tannin fragments floating free in the fluid rather than to whole chains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two drinks can carry the same total tannin load yet, by favoring different fragment sizes, trigger strikingly different mixtures of taste and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate compounds the story because cooler regions produce grapes with fewer skin tannins and shorter seed tannins. As a result,  wines from Pennsylvania or Scandinavia often feel lighter than peers from California or Australia even when alcohol, color, and sugar match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gap has long frustrated growers who cannot simply boost tannin numbers without upsetting balance elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tannin-structure-and-wine-texture-details"&gt;Tannin structure and wine texture details&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32242660/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in‑source fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; approaches are gaining traction across metabolomics because they deliver tandem‑level structural detail on instruments that usually collect only parent masses, saving both money and analysis time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Penn State team adapted the trick for tannins by firing three voltage steps (gentle, moderate, and high) at each molecule. This ensured that dimers, trimers, and longer polymers all leave distinctive fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers validated the workflow on 19 lab mixtures whose tannin &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wine-production-in-a-warming-world-the-winners-and-losers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; were already known, deliberately mixing short and long chains to challenge the algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fingerprint report matched within two percentage points across the board, then repeated the performance on eight commercial ciders where the ingredient lists were revealed only after testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-it-matter"&gt;Why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precision of the tannin fingerprinting method matters because classic colorimetric or precipitation assays lump every tannin together, masking the structural fine print that drives texture and health activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without that information, winemakers have been forced to tweak fermentation time, barrel choice, or fining agents by taste alone and hope the chemistry followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes that tannic element is really harsh, like dragging sandpaper across your tongue. Other times it is velvety or smooth,” said Kwasniewski. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-manipulating-the-texture-of-wine"&gt;Manipulating the texture of wine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania vintners often struggle to build the weightier mouthfeel associated with &lt;a href="https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=vitis+vinifera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; harvested in warmer valleys where skins thicken and seeds ripen fully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new fingerprint in hand, they can select clones, tweak maceration length, or add oak alternatives in a more targeted quest for body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the read‑out comes from a one‑minute &lt;a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Analytical_Chemistry)/Instrumentation_and_Analysis/Chromatography/Liquid_Chromatography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liquid‑chromatography&lt;/a&gt; run, small wineries could check fermentations each morning, log the tannin profile, and steer punch‑downs or blending before irreversible changes set in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwasniewski’s group is beta‑testing a suitcase‑sized instrument that can plug into the hose manifold next to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cider makers and craft‑beer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/red-or-white-the-surprising-truth-about-wine-and-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brewers&lt;/a&gt; have joined the conversation, chasing the sweet spot where bitterness perks up flavor without tipping into harsh drying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early trials suggest they can tune ingredient blends to drop perceived bitterness by fifteen percent while keeping the bright snap consumers expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tannin-structure-and-health-benefits"&gt;Tannin structure and health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond flavor, tannin architecture parallels antioxidant power in foods such as dark chocolate, where procyanidins shoulder much of the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/free-radical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;free‑radical&lt;/a&gt; scavenging load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955286302002152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; shows that lengthening certain procyanidin chains can boost oxidative‑stress protection in tissue models without altering taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Penn State fingerprint could therefore let nutrition researchers screen &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4696435/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cocoa&lt;/a&gt; batches or tea harvests for the most potent molecular forms before those ingredients reach candy factories or teabags. Regulators in turn might rely on the data to validate label claims about flavanol content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also clarify why some epidemiological reports tie moderate red‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/moderate-wine-consumption-reduces-cardiovascular-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; intake to vascular benefits while others find weaker links. Differentiating tannin shapes instead of measuring simple totals may reconcile those mixed results and point nutrition guidelines toward structure‑specific thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-uses-of-tannin-fingerprinting"&gt;Future uses of tannin fingerprinting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team now plans to push detection toward even larger tannin polymers that dominate age‑worthy reds – a task that may require higher voltages or alternative ionization modes to break the stubborn giants apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel work aims to translate the approach to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9796155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;white‑wine phenolics&lt;/a&gt;, coffee, and even hops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaborations with grape breeders are under way to evaluate experimental crosses for mouthfeel before full planting, turning sensory instinct into data that farmers can act on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the project succeeds, future drink labels could list nuanced tannin fingerprints alongside alcohol percentage and acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.5c02379?goto=supporting-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 20:49:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOemcxazlWY09ISmUtSFVZTElJQ2RUTGYxTnBVMnctQmwyOUhkTmhOUUpBX2U3T2pSSTNEVzJYX1FzZVlvbHliOTA5OFFCQU1HN2ZRYVdBcGhWQVpLQnlyaG1Hbi1xUXVhWTN6TVh0VVZpQU9rQXY3YUplVE9vRGpaV1BZbzRDZkd4YXZLcG5R</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，在美国这5个州，美国老年人最快乐，您是其中之一吗？ -雅虎 | Older Americans are happiest living in these 5 US states, study says — is yours one of them? - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbW5KWTF1UEpjd2xfZ0ZZZHd2RVdBOVFPSEY2NWVFQVlnTWRsdkRvOUVsdEZNNXh6YVFYZjZPczdnM05hTEw5VDBOajNiTnZla1NUWlpBVUZ5TUk2WXc3T2pEd2VzTGRlZ25lb3Q2b3lzbnhlbzNkU0hrTnRtNlEyVk1zc0xQNVRyTFpfUjVOYnNuMTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the great perks of reaching your golden years is the newfound freedom to live wherever you choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the kids out of the house and work no longer tying you down, retirement opens the door to relocating to a place that better suits your lifestyle.

Utah&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Utah tops the list as a retirement haven for older adults. According to Caring.com, the state with a score of 7.69 out of 10 on the Senior Happiness Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This score is based primarily on the state’s supportive environment for people in this age cohort. Seniors are more healthy, less isolated and more likely to be engaged in community volunteer work here, which makes retirement much more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire?

According to ElderLife Financial, senior care in Utah tends to &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elderlifefinancial.com%2Fcost-of-care%2Fcost-of-senior-care-utah%2F&amp;amp;utm_medium=EL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cost more;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cost more&lt;/a&gt; than the national average, with a typical assisted living facility costing $4,150 per month, as of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, if you’re wealthier or more &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/managing-money/retirement-planning/vg-heres-how-much-the-typical-baby-boomer-has-saved?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;amp;utm_medium=WL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=106532&amp;amp;utm_content=syn_7aeee603-8ef7-4605-bb53-cedba9f14c46" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:financially secure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;financially secure&lt;/a&gt; than the average retiree, this might be an ideal state to retire in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Idaho&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Idaho is second on Caring.com’s index, scoring 7.38 out of 10. Again, this is based on the density of seniors in the state and the access to senior services and support resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, Idaho is also considered a &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsmartasset.com%2Fretirement%2Fretirement-taxes&amp;amp;utm_medium=EL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tax-friendly state;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tax-friendly state&lt;/a&gt; for older Americans, according to SmartAsset, which means you can expect no taxes on your Social Security benefits and relatively lower sales and property taxes, &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/managing-money/how-to-earn-money/5-money-moves-to-make-now?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;amp;utm_medium=WL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=106532&amp;amp;utm_content=syn_41e7fa8c-3d42-443d-8b16-9618de53c19b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:saving;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;saving&lt;/a&gt; you money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Connecticut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Connecticut ranks third on the Senior Happiness Index, scoring 7.01 out of 10. The state has the third-highest life expectancy and is in the top 10 for overall health. So if you’re trying to live long and stay fit in retirement, this could be an ideal destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, according to SmartAsset, the state is a relatively unfriendly tax jurisdiction for seniors. This means you may have little to no tax benefits for retirement income and could be exposed to relatively high property and inheritance taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cost of living is noticeably higher here. According to Senior Living, a typical retiree can expect to &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seniorliving.org%2Findependent-living%2Fcosts%2F&amp;amp;utm_medium=EL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spend&lt;/a&gt; $4,661 to live independently in Connecticut, 52% higher than the national average, according to Senior Living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Delaware&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaware ties with Connecticut with a score of 7.01 out of 10, and ranks ninth for health outcomes. It is in the top five states with the lowest ratio of older adults living alone, which means you’re less vulnerable to social isolation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaware is also tax-friendly to seniors, according to SmartAsset. The average monthly cost of living independently here is $3,862, which Senior Living reports is just 26% above the national average. Overall, Delaware could be an excellent choice for your golden years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Nebraska&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Home to billionaire Warren Buffett — one of the most famous recent retirees in America — Nebraska ranks fifth on Caring.com’s Senior Happiness Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, if you’re looking to join the Oracle of Omaha and retire in the Cornhusker state, it won’t cost you much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The average monthly cost of living for an independent senior is just $1,917, 37% lower than the national average, according to Senior Living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If saving money in &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/retirement/best-free-retirement-planning-tools?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;amp;utm_medium=WL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=106532&amp;amp;utm_content=syn_20d1c3cb-f91f-4cff-ae79-83e2808d32f5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:retirement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;retirement&lt;/a&gt; is a top priority, Nebraska should be on your list for relocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What to read next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like what you read?

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Healthy Mediterranean Recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 332 to 384 calories while the lunches span 339 to 417 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_157-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is consistently touted for its &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits.&lt;/a&gt; This healthy way of eating is linked to improved heart health, sharper &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8050356/brain-benefits-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt;, reduced risk of developing diabetes, decreased inflammation and weight loss. In recent years, the Mediterranean diet has come under criticism for being too focused on the cuisines of countries like Italy, France, Spain and Greece, while leaving out other countries in this large region. In fact, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8059162/dietitian-syrian-roots-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Mediterranean region&lt;/a&gt; spans three continents and includes 21 countries. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8046714/a-new-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;New Mediterranean Diet&lt;/a&gt; aims to take a more comprehensive approach to following the nutrition, food and cultural attributes of this region. This shift in viewpoint is more inclusive, diversifies the flavor profile and is a more accurate viewpoint of the Mediterranean region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_158-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_159-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To follow the Mediterranean diet (and reap the health benefits), aim to include plenty of fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, and whole grains, as well as a wide variety of proteins, such as nuts, seeds, beans and lentils, and animal proteins. One principle of the Mediterranean diet includes cooking more meals at home, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; by limiting processed foods. The Mediterranean diet is more lifestyle-focused than a traditional diet, so aiming to find enjoyment in meal preparation and flavors, sharing meals with others, increasing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937844/how-self-compassion-can-help-your-heart-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating regular exercise are all components of this healthy lifestyle.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A new daily pill could provide an easier, more convenient way to lower cholesterol and reduce heart attack and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stroke risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The experimental medication, called Obicetrapib, underwent a Phase 3 clinical trial at Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial included more than 2,500 people averaging 65 years of age. All had either been diagnosed with heart disease or had genetically high cholesterol, according to a university press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/cheap-pantry-staple-could-key-lowering-cholesterol-research-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THIS CHEAP PANTRY STAPLE COULD BE KEY TO LOWERING CHOLESTEROL, NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants were receiving "maximum tolerated doses" of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/cholesterol" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cholesterol-lowering therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group received Obicetrapib and another group took a placebo, while still maintaining their existing cholesterol drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new daily pill could provide an easier, more convenient way to lower cholesterol and reduce heart attack and stroke risk.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, the participants taking &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the new drug&lt;/a&gt; showed a 32.6% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 33.5% drop in lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], the release stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were presented last month at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress in the U.K. and were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/womens-heart-disease-risk-could-predict-30-years-advance-blood-test-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WOMEN’S HEART DISEASE RISK COULD BE PREDICTED UP TO 30 YEARS IN ADVANCE WITH ONE BLOOD TEST, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that many people at high risk of heart attack or stroke don’t get their cholesterol levels low enough, even on the best available treatments," said study lead Professor Stephen Nicholls, director of Monash University’s Victorian Heart Institute and Monash Health’s Victorian Heart Hospital, in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"We know that many people at high risk of heart attack or stroke don’t get their cholesterol levels low enough, even on the best available treatments."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obicetrapib offers a promising new option — not only did it lower LDL cholesterol by over 30%, but we also saw a reduction in Lp(a), which is much harder to treat and has been linked to increased &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is sometimes called "bad cholesterol," is associated with negative health effects when present in high amounts.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is sometimes called "bad cholesterol," is associated with negative health effects when present in high amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL can build up in the blood vessels and increase heart attack and stroke risk, the researchers cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a protein that is known to greatly increase the chances of a heart attack when it’s present in high levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike LDL, Lp(a) is an inherited risk factor that can’t be modified with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;healthy behaviors&lt;/a&gt; or medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a protein that is known to greatly increase the chances of a heart attack when it’s present in high levels in the blood.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obicetrapib was found to be "well-tolerated" by the participants, the researchers noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be a valuable tool in the fight against heart disease," Nicholls added. "It’s convenient, it’s effective, and it may help close the gap for patients who’ve run out of options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study — which was funded by NewAmsterdam Pharma, a developer of Obicetrapib that is based in the Netherlands — did have some limitations, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obicetrapib was found to be "well-tolerated" by the participants, the researchers noted. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the participants were not chosen based on high Lp(a), which means the study did not determine how the drug impacted those with elevated levels of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study assessed changes in LDL levels, but did not measure actual &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart attack or stroke&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;More studies&lt;/a&gt; are needed to follow patients for longer time periods and to include more diverse cohorts, the researchers acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the researchers for additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

							&lt;p data-start="108" data-end="427"&gt;Last Tuesday I caught myself with 17 browser tabs open, over-optimizing a dog-food subscription. Fifteen minutes later my coffee was cold, my shoulders were up to my ears, and—ironically—the dog still hadn’t eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="108" data-end="427"&gt;That little spiral is the signature move of overthinking: maximum mental spin, minimal forward motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1030"&gt;Overthinking isn’t a moral failing; it’s what happens when a brain built for saber-tooth threats tries to calibrate every modern micro-choice—from comparison-shopping toothbrush heads to deciding which meditation app has the “best” background chime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1030"&gt;The real art lies in clearing enough cognitive desk space to keep decisions practical, emotions settled, and life—well—liveable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1030"&gt;Below are seven research-backed moves I lean on whenever my mind threatens to behave like a runaway spreadsheet. Each one trades rumination for simple action so you can exit the mental roundabout and actually hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1037" data-end="1060"&gt;1. Shrink the menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1062" data-end="1464"&gt;Colleagues once joked I could model a cost–benefit ratio for choosing a pen. It turns out the brain genuinely dislikes a buffet of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1062" data-end="1464"&gt;In a landmark field experiment, Columbia University researchers set up a jam-tasting booth: when shoppers &lt;a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20%282000%29.pdf?.com"&gt;faced 24 flavours&lt;/a&gt;, only 3 % bought a jar; with six flavours, purchases jumped to 30 %—a ten-fold difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1466" data-end="1809"&gt;The reason is cognitive bandwidth. Every extra comparison inflates the decision tree and drains willpower reserves we need for truly consequential choices. Psychologist Roy Baumeister calls the phenomenon &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6119549/?.com"&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/a&gt;—the more mini-decisions you make, the weaker subsequent self-control becomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1811" data-end="2113"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1811" data-end="1831"&gt;Practical pivot:&lt;/strong&gt; give yourself a &lt;em data-start="1848" data-end="1865"&gt;decision budget&lt;/em&gt;. Three viable options, ten minutes of research, then lock it. You’ll spend the reclaimed energy on things that actually move the satisfaction needle—like finally emailing Grandma those vacation photos instead of refreshing yet another review site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2120" data-end="2148"&gt;2. Dump the mental tabs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2150" data-end="2572"&gt;Imagine your mind as a browser and rumination as 47 auto-play videos. Offload them. A Michigan State study had chronic worriers &lt;a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/for-worriers-expressive-writing-cools-brain-on-stressful-tasks?.com"&gt;hand-write their anxieties for eight minutes&lt;/a&gt; before tackling a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2150" data-end="2572"&gt;Brain-wave scans showed they performed just as accurately as controls but with significantly less neural effort—like closing memory-hungry apps before launching Photoshop. &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/for-worriers-expressive-writing-cools-brain-on-stressful-tasks?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;msutoday.msu.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2574" data-end="2924"&gt;My nightly ritual is a two-column spreadsheet: one column for every uncensored, half-baked worry; the other labelled Action / Archive / Absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2574" data-end="2924"&gt;Seeing thoughts in cells strips them of backstage mystery; half get the “Absurd” stamp and evaporate overnight. The goal isn’t literary merit—it’s exporting rumination so your working memory can reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2931" data-end="2959"&gt;3. Flip worry into WOOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2961" data-end="3352"&gt;Overthinking often disguises itself as planning but skips a crucial step: confronting obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2961" data-end="3352"&gt;Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen developed the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8893137/?.com"&gt;WOOP method&lt;/a&gt;—Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan—showing that pairing positive visualisation with &lt;em data-start="3199" data-end="3208"&gt;if-then&lt;/em&gt; contingency plans dramatically boosts follow-through on everything from healthy eating to study habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2961" data-end="3352"&gt;Here’s the applied math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="3382" data-end="3575"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3382" data-end="3428"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3384" data-end="3428"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3384" data-end="3393"&gt;Wish:&lt;/strong&gt; “Clear my inbox flags by 5 p.m.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3429" data-end="3468"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3431" data-end="3468"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3431" data-end="3443"&gt;Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; “Evenings feel light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3469" data-end="3514"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3471" data-end="3514"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3471" data-end="3484"&gt;Obstacle:&lt;/strong&gt; “Slack pings hijack focus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3515" data-end="3575"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3517" data-end="3575"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3517" data-end="3526"&gt;Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; “If Slack opens, then mute it for 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3577" data-end="3799"&gt;Mapping the obstacle tightens the loop from abstract worry to concrete trigger → response. It’s like fermentation: introduce a helpful “obstacle culture” and raw worry turns into flavour instead of souring the whole batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3806" data-end="3862"&gt;4. Breathe like a barista—slow, intentional, frothy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3864" data-end="4204"&gt;Breath is the only lever that plugs straight into both body and mind. Stanford Medicine researchers found that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2023/02/cyclic-sighing-can-help-breathe-away-anxiety.html?.com"&gt;five minutes a day of “cyclic sighing”&lt;/a&gt;—a double inhale through the nose followed by a long, slow mouth exhale—reduced anxiety more than mindfulness meditation or normal paced breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4206" data-end="4547"&gt;Physiologically, elongated exhales cue the vagus nerve to shift the body from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest. My hack: cue the pattern to music—inhale on a four-beat pickup, exhale through the chorus. When the song ends, so does the exercise. It feels less like a “technique” and more like letting the playlist steer your nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4554" data-end="4595"&gt;5. Label, don’t wrestle, the thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4597" data-end="5009"&gt;Rumination thrives on vagueness; slap a label on it and the spell breaks. Mindfulness meta-analyses show significant drops in repetitive negative thinking among participants who practice &lt;em data-start="4784" data-end="4807"&gt;non-judgmental naming&lt;/em&gt; of thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4597" data-end="5009"&gt;Instead of “What if I bomb the presentation?” try: “Planning anxiety, noted.” The label recruits your prefrontal cortex—your internal project manager—reducing limbic hijack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5011" data-end="5153"&gt;Think of it like flagging emails: once tagged, a monster thread shrinks to a tidy folder and stops pinging your mental inbox every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5160" data-end="5188"&gt;6. Automate the trivial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5190" data-end="5534"&gt;Overthinkers burn premium fuel on sub-premium tasks: &lt;em data-start="5243" data-end="5276"&gt;Which shirt? Which font weight?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5190" data-end="5534"&gt;Decision fatigue studies show that high achievers guard cognitive resources by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6119549/?.com"&gt;routinising the bottom 20 % of choices&lt;/a&gt;—Mark Zuckerberg’s grey T-shirts, Barack Obama’s two-suit rotation, my Tuesday/Thursday oatmeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5536" data-end="5586"&gt;Habit scaffolding turns defaults into autopilot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5587" data-end="5732"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5587" data-end="5636"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5589" data-end="5636"&gt;Breakfast = oats + berries, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5637" data-end="5678"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5639" data-end="5678"&gt;Workout = 7 a.m. on calendar invites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5679" data-end="5732"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5681" data-end="5732"&gt;Invoices = last calendar day, recurring reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5734" data-end="5895"&gt;It’s the cognitive equivalent of putting recurring expenses on auto-pay: mental 401(k) contributions that compound into creative liquidity when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5902" data-end="5938"&gt;7. Set “good-enough” thresholds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5940" data-end="6226"&gt;Financial models rely on satisficing—stopping once returns level off. Life decisions can too. Instead of evaluating infinity, create a checklist that defines &lt;em data-start="6102" data-end="6108"&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;: “Airbnb rating ≥ 4.7, within budget, Wi-Fi &amp;gt; 50 Mbps.” Once a place hits the spec sheet, click &lt;em data-start="6205" data-end="6211"&gt;Book&lt;/em&gt; and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6228" data-end="6588"&gt;Why it matters: a 2025 Nature portfolio study&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-03783-1?.com"&gt; linked maladaptive perfectionism to increased loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and depressive symptoms, highlighting how endless self-critique undercuts wellbeing. &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-03783-1?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;nature.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A clear threshold is gate security for your mental stadium—after requirements are met, no extra thoughts get in, especially not worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6595" data-end="6611"&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6613" data-end="6861"&gt;Overthinking feels productive because it &lt;em data-start="6654" data-end="6660"&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; energy—like a treadmill desk for cognition. But left unchecked it converts that energy into heat, not motion. The seven moves above reclaim choice architecture, sensory grounding, and goal friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6863" data-end="7262"&gt;&lt;em data-start="6863" data-end="6880"&gt;Shrink the menu&lt;/em&gt; trims excess branches from decision trees. &lt;em data-start="6924" data-end="6945"&gt;Dumping mental tabs&lt;/em&gt; frees processing power. &lt;em data-start="6970" data-end="6976"&gt;WOOP&lt;/em&gt; welds wishes to plans. &lt;em data-start="7000" data-end="7016"&gt;Cyclic sighing&lt;/em&gt; tells your nervous system the sabre-tooth has gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6863" data-end="7262"&gt;&lt;em data-start="7069" data-end="7089"&gt;Labelling thoughts&lt;/em&gt; keeps them from starring in an endless sequel. &lt;em data-start="7137" data-end="7149"&gt;Automation&lt;/em&gt; protects prime fuel for high-leverage tasks. And &lt;em data-start="7199" data-end="7223"&gt;good-enough thresholds&lt;/em&gt; lock the exit door on perfectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7264" data-end="7458"&gt;Try one this week; stack another next. Happiness isn’t the absence of thought—it’s the presence of thoughts that finish their shift, clock out, and leave you the keys to a quieter, clearer mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms usually develop within seven to 14 days after exposure, although they can appear as long as 21 days after exposure. The second stage of measles, according to health officials, begins three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash appears on the face and spreads to other parts of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared, according to Virginia health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G2CVD2XZXZGFVHCT6TCE3GA73A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have received two doses of a &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank"&gt;measles-containing vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="475LQ4D5W5GZDGW4YXABPEIK7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anyone who thinks they might have been exposed and are not immune, or who thinks they are at risk of developing measles, should contact their health-care provider, officials said.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Americans fall short on their fiber intake, which can lead to constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dinner rich in fiber and other gut-friendly nutrients can help you poop in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our top pick: a dinner loaded with plant-based proteins and fiber from chickpeas, cauliflower and whole grains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve seen plenty of aspirational morning routines on social media. Many people like to start the day with meditation, journaling, hot tea or working out—but what about a morning poop? While talking about poop as part of your morning routine may be too cringy to share online, staying regular is just as important for your overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If having a regular morning No. 2 feels as out of reach as 10 minutes of uninterrupted meditation time in the morning, you may benefit from making a few tweaks to your diet. Eating a diet low in fiber is linked with constipation, a common gastrointestinal condition. In fact, 15% of the U.S. population struggles with chronic constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There are several reasons for constipation, and inadequate dietary fiber is one of them. After all, more than 90% of American women and 97% of American men don’t meet recommendations for daily fiber intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a fiber-rich dinner at night can set you up for a regular morning poop. Here’s why: Your digestive system slows down when you go to sleep, so filling up with fiber at dinner gives that fiber a chance to do the work of softening and bulking up your stool. In the morning, your colon tends to become more active, meaning it’s primed and ready for a poop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not to mention, dinner is a great opportunity to pack in some extra fiber so that you’re hitting the recommended 22 to 34 grams of fiber per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Read on to find out our top dinner pick that may help you poop in the A.M.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Opt for Plant-Based Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re feeling backed up, choosing a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; at dinner may be just what you need to get things moving again. Beans and legumes are great sources of protein, and they are also high in fiber, an essential nutrient that isn’t found in chicken, beef and fish. Not only that, most types of beans and lentils contain a combination of both soluble and insoluble fiber, which support regularity in different ways. Just a half-cup of cooked black beans contains 8 grams of fiber, over a quarter of your daily fiber needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Legumes also provide a host of other beneficial nutrients that support a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthier gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Pack in Some Whole Grains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sneak in a few extra grams of fiber by choosing a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grain&lt;/a&gt; for your starch with dinner. Research has found that whole grain eaters were less likely to report constipation, so this relatively simple swap could potentially get things moving again.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, a small study that included women with functional constipation found that their symptoms improved when eating whole grains or brown rice over four weeks versus a diet with white rice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Incorporate Non-Starchy Vegetables &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are non-starchy vegetables good sources of fiber, but they're also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-8680682" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that quench the free radicals that can contribute to inflammation. Inflammation increases your risk of many chronic diseases and may also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944613/inflammation-might-be-the-reason-you-cant-poop-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lead to constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, non-starchy veggies contain vitamins and minerals to support your overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are looking for a flavor-packed dinner that will also help you poop in the morning, we recommend &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-chickpea-cauliflower-pitas-with-sun-dried-tomato-sauce-8609745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Chickpea &amp;amp; Cauliflower Pitas with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce&lt;/a&gt;. Here is why it’s the best choice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hitting the mark on your fiber intake for the day will be easy when you make these pitas for dinner, since they provide a whopping 13 grams of fiber. Chickpeas, cauliflower and whole-grain pitas all add to the total fiber count for this meal. Including legumes also ensures you’ll be eating a good balance of both soluble&lt;em&gt; and&lt;/em&gt; insoluble fiber for healthy poops. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Pre- and Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pitas are doubly beneficial for gut health since they provide both prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotics provide fuel for the beneficial bacteria that live in your gut. One excellent source of prebiotics is chickpeas, which serve as the main protein source in these delicious pitas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt, tahini and sun-dried tomatoes combine into a flavor-packed sauce that is also rich in probiotics thanks to the yogurt. Probiotic-rich foods help maintain a healthy balance of beneficial versus harmful bacteria in the gut. A small study of participants with constipation found that eating yogurt reduced constipation symptoms and helped improve the types of bacteria in their gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although fruits and vegetables are usually the first thing we think of when it comes to anti-inflammatory foods, don’t overlook the spices in your pantry. Cumin and turmeric give the cauliflower in these pitas tons of flavor and provide an antioxidant boost, too. The bioactive compound in turmeric called curcumin may be particularly helpful for lowering inflammation by blocking the production of cytokines, which are compounds that trigger inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although there is no &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-time-of-the-day-to-poop-8642393" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best time of day to poop&lt;/a&gt;, starting your day off with a morning poop may be a habit that helps you feel good. A key factor to setting yourself up for a poop after breakfast? A high-fiber dinner like these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-chickpea-cauliflower-pitas-with-sun-dried-tomato-sauce-8609745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted Chickpea &amp;amp; Cauliflower Pitas with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce&lt;/a&gt;. Not only are they loaded with flavor and fiber, they also provide other gut-friendly nutrients, such as probiotics, prebiotics and antioxidants, to support gut health.

Conventional thrombectomy has a very low efficacy rate because of this imprecision, and the procedure can result in pieces of the clot breaking off and moving to more difficult-to-reach regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombectomy via milli-spinner also enters the brain with a catheter, but instead of using a normal vacuum device, it employs a spinning tube outfitted with fins and slits that can suck up the clot much more meticulously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford neuroimaging expert Jeremy Heit, who also coauthored a new paper about the device &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09049-0" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, explained in the school's press release that the efficacy of the milli-spinner is "unbelievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most cases, we’re more than doubling the efficacy of current technology, and for the toughest clots — which we’re only removing about 11 percent of the time with current devices — we’re getting the artery open on the first try 90 percent of the time," Heit said. "This is a sea-change technology that will drastically improve our ability to help people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renee Zhao, the senior author of the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper who teaches mechanical engineering at Stanford and creates what she calls "millirobots," said that conventional thrombectomies just aren't cutting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With existing technology, there’s no way to reduce the size of the clot," Zhao said. "They rely on deforming and rupturing the clot to remove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What’s unique about the milli-spinner is that it applies compression and shear forces to shrink the entire clot," she continued, "dramatically reducing the volume without causing rupture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as the team discovered, the device can cut and vacuum up to five percent of its original size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It works so well, for a wide range of clot compositions and sizes," Zhao said. "Even for tough... clots, which are impossible to treat with current technologies, our milli-spinner can treat them using this simple yet powerful mechanics concept to densify the fibrin network and shrink the clot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though its main experimental use case is brain clot removal, Zhao is excited about its other uses, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We’re exploring other biomedical applications for the milli-spinner design, and even possibilities beyond medicine," the engineer said. "There are some very exciting opportunities ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on brains:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/microplastics-brain-mental-health" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microplastics in Your Brain May Be Causing Mental Health Issues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 16:45:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5nb1dRMkJ3b0lLX2hTUkdfZ2N5QTZyUTkyLXFLWkJ4WVVqeFlKVUoyVHM3Nm5KOENyY1RQZGQ0TXF2NmhJMjNhODVRVXVCUXA4cENlczNsR3V3S2QwRUJJUkVn</guid></item></channel></rss>
