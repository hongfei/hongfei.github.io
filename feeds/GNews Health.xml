                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine — the first shot found to prevent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s committee on Thursday is expected to change that — contradicting previous public health advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear exactly what the committee is considering, but the American Academy of Pediatrics will still urge a birth dose, said the organization’s Dr. Sean O’Leary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Liver disease can cause lifelong health issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some — especially infants and children — it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don’t completely clear the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Shots for newborns have been recommended for years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the nation’s vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren’t tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Committee revisits the newborn recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;several anti-vaccine voices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel has raised concerns about giving a vaccine to a baby so early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we asking our babies to solve an adult problem?” committee member Dr. Evelyn Griffin asked at a September meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: “The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It’s one of trust. ... It’s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it’s slated to be acted on during Thursday’s meeting, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would happen if the shots are delayed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report — which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal — estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O’Leary said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee’s most direct power comes over what’s covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any change stands to confuse and frighten parents, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it scares, it shares” on social media, O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several medical and public health organizations — and even some state government officials — have said, in advance of the meeting, that changing the recommendation is a terrible idea. Among them is a recently formed coalition of government leaders from several Northeastern states, which this week issued a statement saying they would continue to urge families to get a birth dose within 24 hours of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, this week called on Congress to compel Kennedy to appear at a hearing and explain ACIP’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ending the decades-long recommendation that babies born in the U.S. get vaccinated against hepatitis B is a heartless choice to allow babies to die,” Murray said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an1g000o3b78fxwxlqag@published"&gt;Parents are constantly reminded about food allergies. Whether it’s the sign on the day care window saying that the building is a nut-free space, or someone regaling you at a birthday party about all of the foods their child can’t eat, you can’t go for more than a day or two without thinking about allergic reactions. It’s just one more worry to add to the giant pile of things that you have at the back of your mind every day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an3e000p3b78cmg797a2@published"&gt;But according to a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, there’s good news in the realm of nuts. Peanut allergies have fallen precipitously, with rates dropping by 30 percent or more since 2013. It’s great news for anxious parents, for community spaces where children eat, and for all the kids who deserve to know the simple bliss of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Let’s look at the data the study is drawing from and at what has happened over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an5c000q3b780r0kzw2k@published"&gt;Peanut allergies were for a long time something of a source of academic disagreement. In the ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s we saw a &lt;a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/62/1/91.short?casa_token=vmHy4vQLsPIAAAAA:w-wOJjY5PEGBPhNOEWy1umYtUICdtCwx8zgpppoGcQDPyHQr7SlVrQ1D6g0TmZ0M6CWOpQVkmsKL"&gt;sharp increase&lt;/a&gt; in the number of children with allergies to a variety of foods. We still aren’t entirely clear on whether this was due to better measurement of disease, better testing, or some environmental trigger that could’ve impacted children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an98000r3b7840cpggyy@published"&gt;The advice at the time was that the &lt;a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120209132957/http:/cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/cotpeanutall.pdf"&gt;best strategy was avoidance&lt;/a&gt; for those at high risk of developing an allergy, determined by a combination of family history, other allergies, and having eczema, which can indicate allergy issues. If you’re never exposed to an allergen, you can’t develop an allergy, and this would result in fewer allergies in the community, the theory went. However, this advice &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/02770903.2015.1126848?casa_token=7iNQkW1BzjcAAAAA%3AS2U2SF0j6feAhrIGJ-5slwZILZQ8-xwoYANFNO9s04yR2YMBQAxsSGjympvQr46VuArJGoc7kXfO_w"&gt;did not seem&lt;/a&gt; to stem the rising tide of allergies, and in 2008 the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/121/1/183/71045?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Pediatrics_TrendMD_0&amp;amp;casa_token=O8hiPhHAYMMAAAAA:P8oMCNdWIouyzULKot_8s15KBq-S6gbPDrHdR8C7BX3kgM2vl2j2rkVJEvMIAQKcKPKXOdZUNg"&gt;officially changed&lt;/a&gt; the recommendations to say that there was no benefit to avoiding foods.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anbb000s3b78ykxeip23@published"&gt;This is where the story gets really interesting. A group of researchers noticed that peanut allergies were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674908016989?casa_token=P73_tXyYcW4AAAAA:JB96jXXix7W32QCckINiKlvlZq4h0c-VwWWnTTOzJ2s0WWywfdIqSi6tXt-91-jaG1IYJyLvVg"&gt;10 times more common&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. than in Israel. While there are many differences between the two countries, they hypothesized that this could be because Israeli children are exposed to peanuts early and often through a range of peanut-based snacks. U.K. children, on the other hand, have a much lower exposure to peanuts in their early years.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7andk000t3b78jn8osa3z@published"&gt;This led to a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850"&gt;truly fascinating randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; published in 2015. Researchers took a large group of infants aged 4–11 months who were at a very high risk of getting a peanut allergy—either they already had severe eczema, an egg allergy, or both. These kids were then randomly allocated to either get peanuts regularly until they were 5 years old, or have no exposure to peanuts at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ang0000u3b78fh5nno6h@published"&gt;The results were, in a word, startling: 1 in 7 of the children in the no-peanuts group developed an allergy by age 5, compared to just 1 in 50 in the peanut group. Early peanut exposure reduced a child’s risk of developing an allergy to peanuts by a little over seven times.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ani0000v3b78cgmpb96n@published"&gt;The study immediately changed recommendations. Rather than the previous advice—which at that point was that we didn’t really know whether exposure made a difference or not—pediatricians started to advise that kids should be exposed to potential food allergens early and often. At the very least, every baby should get peanuts before they turned 1. It’s the advice I was given when my daughter was born in 2023, and it’s probably very familiar to new parents everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ankb000w3b781icktlne@published"&gt;The new research that’s just hit the headlines shows that this advice appears to be working. &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;The Pediatrics journal study&lt;/a&gt; is an observational paper looking at trends in peanut allergies in a cohort of children in the United States. The authors took kids aged 0–3 from 2013–2015, before the new advice came out, and compared them to a cohort from 2015–2019. They used a variety of statistical models to examine what happened with respect to peanut allergies and eczema over the course of two years for the children in each of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anmw000x3b78t4jjcz4c@published"&gt;Overall, there was a reduction of around 30 percent in peanut allergies. In absolute terms, around 1 in 100 kids had a diagnosed peanut allergy before the guidelines changed, and around 1 in 300 had an allergy in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anoy000y3b78zvnpw6s2@published"&gt;There are always caveats to this sort of research. While the authors did use a type of statistical modeling called an interrupted time series, which in theory allows us to make causal claims here, in practice it’s a bit more complicated. We can’t be entirely sure that this decline is driven by the guideline change. On the other hand, it’s hard to see what else could be happening here. We know that introducing peanuts early reduces peanut allergies, so the fact that they fell after the new guidelines is exactly what we’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anqv000z3b78k9ycn4vc@published"&gt;This whole story is a great example of science working exactly as intended. It’s messy, and a bit painful, but through rigorous experimentation we came to the right conclusion. We had a theory that didn’t pan out. We then came up with another theory, which proved to be true. We changed the guidelines to reflect this, and are now preventing tens of thousands of kids from developing allergies every year. In a time when science is under relentless attack, it’s a heartening reminder that the whole process can work well. We just have to let &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This will be brief because I have written about it before.  The White House cover-up artists have stated that the bruises on the President’s right hand are due to his use of aspirin and trauma from shaking hands.  But the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend AGAINST the use of aspirin in individuals 70 years or older due to the increased risk of internal bleeding EXCEPT if they have evidence of cardiovascular disease or a history of a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke, etc).  As far as I am aware, the venous stasis problems that Donald  admits to is not an indication for aspirin, even to prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo, either the President’s physician is incorrectly prescribing aspirin or Donald is ducking the fact that he’s had an event or has evidence of cardiovascular disease that he, his physician and those around him are covering up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have hoped that the legacy media would have promoted this story by now.  I guess it remains for us to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

The mice were tested for changes in memory and motor function over a 12-week period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior tests on the mice showed that hydrogen sulfide improved cognitive and motor function by 50 percent compared to mice that did not receive the injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice that received the treatment were better able to remember the locations of platform edits and appeared more physically active than the mice that had simulated Alzheimer’s disease but did not receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that the behavioral outcomes of Alzheimer’s disease could be reversed by introducing hydrogen sulfide, but the researchers wanted to investigate how the brain chemically reacted to the gaseous molecule,” Johns Hopkins Medicine &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease"&gt;wrote in a press release about the study. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-272427"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). When there are healthy levels of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β acts as a signaling molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that in the absence of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β is overattracted to another protein in the brain called Tau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When GSK3β and Tau interact, Tau causes clumps inside nerve cells. As those clumps grow, the tangled proteins block communication between the nerves, eventually causing them to die, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to the deterioration and eventual loss of cognition, memory and motor function that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease,” the press release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cascade of events is important to designing therapies that can block this interaction like hydrogen sulfide is able to do,” Ph.D student Daniel Giovinazzo, the first author of the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until just a few years ago, researchers lacked the tools to mimic how the body makes small quantities of hydrogen sulfide inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The compound used in this study does just that and shows by correcting brain levels of hydrogen sulfide, we could successfully reverse some aspects of Alzheimer’s disease,” collaborator Dr. Matt Whiteman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNVG1LVFJ3Zk5BYkZ5cnF4LWJCeDB0LVVnOFY3bE5GWkw0SmVLRU5uOUhWTTNqQ0R5TlN4QzdJc2phZ3FWVVRNaGR5M0JieDNpZDdBTGFXa1pJb1NOc0g1OThKLXkwcnpuQ2ZfVm5vNEVpdS01TE55aERYQ1ZYNHNEUWM3a0hDTWFRS0pxLUJKRUVmaHVqVThWc1ZKdDhZUQ</guid></item><item><title>一位心脏外科医生挽救了他十几岁时的生命。现在他们一起做手术。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/12/03/rheumatic-fever-heart-surgery-ethiopia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OAS2DBWFQJH4DKQ42G6SYGB3AQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The first time Mesfin Yana Dollar&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;assisted with an open-heart surgery, his patient was a teenage girl from Ethiopia.

That’s not breaking news. Sugars and artificial flavors &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lack quality nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.

But that’s not so healthy either. Recent research found that even &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/08/soda-diet-liver-disease-study-research/86579096007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;just one can of diet soda&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/12/can-you-get-diabetes-from-eating-too-much-sugar/71764449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; disease. Regular soda, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Yet, many Americans are addicted to fizzy drinks. And for those who wish to stop, cutting soda cold-turkey might not be a good idea — as some USA TODAY journalists &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/29/soda-health-side-effects-quitting-caffeine/86585472007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;recently learned&lt;/a&gt; when we tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People are struggling to stop even though they really want to,” explains Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. “You go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s because soda &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/12/soda-addiction-science-sugar-caffeine/86963258007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;appeals to our brain’s instinctual desire&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/20/is-corn-syrup-bad-for-you/71848699007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sugars&lt;/a&gt; and fats that help us survive — and our bodies adapt to increasingly high exposure to these ingredients over time, raising tolerance and making quitting painful, Gearhardt explains. You may get headaches, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/31/why-am-i-so-angry-all-the-time/83835896007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;irritability&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to think about it as if you were quitting smoking,” Gearhardt says. “You need to know what are your cues? What are your triggers? What emotions set you off? Certain times of day? Certain people? … Then you can come up with plans for a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alternative that’s right for you has a lot to do with why you’re drinking soda in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Here's how to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The best soda alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If people want caffeine, switching to coffee without sweetener is much healthier,” Gearhardt says, but she gives one warning: “Getting caffeine through soda gives energy much faster. You may not get as intense of a caffeine hit from coffee, so there might be a little bit of grieving … but that’s because we weren’t supposed to be getting that in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Morning headache? You can also try over-the-counter medications that contain a bit of &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, says Jennifer Temple, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Laboratory at the University of Buffalo. If you’re using soda to address a chronic medical issue, such as &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/21/why-does-my-head-hurt/85661258007/?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=deeperdive&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good idea to consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/05/28/is-green-tea-good-for-you-health-benefits-every-day/70244800007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tea is a good option&lt;/a&gt; for a later-in-the-day &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt; as it generally contains less caffeine than coffee.

This causes chills and fever-like sweats at night. Tumors grow and inflame nearby tissues as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 20% of advanced colon cancer patients report drenching sweats. Early stages show it too, when people ignore the pattern. They blame spicy food, stress, or menopause instead. Night sweats signal the body fights inflammation from the tumor. This happens especially when combined with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track the patterns of sweats closely. Note if they pair with weight loss, or bowel changes.

Kennedy at the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the federal government has been &lt;a href="/podcasts/462402/rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-advisory-committee-immunization-practices"&gt;casting doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines in the months leading up to virus season. Even though his department did approve a new flu vaccine for this year, his advisers also &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-committee-to-vote-on-flu-shots-and-preservative-thimerosal"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; removing certain ingredients from flu shots, even though those materials are not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The federal government is not going to be a reliable ally during this year’s cold and flu season, having already taken steps to undermine trust in both the Covid and flu vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You can protect yourself this winter — but you’ll have to do it yourself, in cooperation with the people close to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Think about your own risk and how much risk you’re willing to tolerate, communicate clearly with friends and family about your approach, and keep a close eye on your local situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have also &lt;a href="/health/460528/vaccine-recommendations-rfk-hhs-new-guidance-covid"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; any specific recommendations for the Covid vaccinations and, instead, told people to depend on “individual decision making.” On the cusp of flu activity picking up in the US, a top Food and Drug Administration official is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine process should be overhauled because it is not sufficient, while making unsubstantiated claims that the Covid shots have killed a small number of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And now, the forecast for the next few months is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Not only is there disarray among public health authorities, but this year’s cold and flu season is looking to be especially bad. That is partly bad luck; developing a new flu shot every year is always a guessing game, and this year’s shot is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;not very well matched&lt;/a&gt; to the most widespread flu strains. But, it’s also partly a matter of choice, a consequence of the anti-public health mania Kennedy has helped stoke. The number of flu vaccinations administered between August and October &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90CEPo7LTAmN5x15eEfmmRynhCyV3GbnUtBeq6U-L1vRIAoTXov57Ts4wY6WY3-o8GR_b8kMfz2v5_S2NxAyVjKgsTDQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=390652300&amp;amp;utm_content=390652300&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;was the lowest&lt;/a&gt; in the past six years. The number of Covid boosters available to the public has been steadily dropping with each new shot, and now, Kennedy Jr.’s health department has decided to limit access. Less than 15 percent of US adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html#:~:text=21%2C%202025-,About,with%20a%20health%20care%20provider."&gt;have received&lt;/a&gt; a Covid booster this year, including less than 1 in 3 seniors over 65. New RSV vaccines for infants &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/study-finds-low-varied-rsv-monoclonal-and-maternal-vaccination#:~:text=State%20variations%2C%20timing%20tracking,improvements%20as%20the%20season%20progressed."&gt;have had discouragingly low uptake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This winter, more than ever, we are all on our own in combating flu, cold, RSV, and Covid-19. The federal government is no longer a reliable ally, because it has shown, with Kennedy leading the charge, that it will &lt;a href="/health/459768/trump-cdc-director-monarez-robert-kennedy-jr"&gt;routinely ignore established science&lt;/a&gt;. The medical community is scrambling to fill the void, but the fundamental challenge is that many people, not only within Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement but across the political spectrum, no longer trust the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new reality, not everyone will be on the same page. Some people may choose to take no precautions at all, even as cases rise. But, you do have agency to protect your personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="public-health-is-out-for-now-were-in-a-new-era-of-diy-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Public” health is out for now. We’re in a new era of DIY health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For a long time, public health was embraced by the public. It had stacked up wins over the decades: eradicating polio and smallpox in the 20th century and measles at the turn of the 21st. Diseases that had killed millions over millennia were relegated to the past as better sanitation, vaccinations, and greater awareness — the bedrock of the public health playbook — became woven into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As recently as a decade ago, the people who opposed vaccinations and other public health interventions remained well outside of the mainstream. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself was, before the start of the Covid pandemic, a marginal figure who spewed conspiracy theories about vaccines and autism. Even Trump kept his distance from Kennedy during his first term, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-trump-rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-book-2025-10"&gt;reportedly at the urging of Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, despite his own past flirtations with anti-vaccine rhetoric. And while Kennedy’s influence and the work of other anti-vaccine activists may have chipped away at the public’s belief in vaccinations, they had limited success. Most Americans still thought getting their annual shots was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, we live in a different reality now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two decades ago, 94 percent of Americans believed it was extremely or very important to get children vaccinated — near unanimity, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2025, just 69 percent still agree. In &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/quick-take/challenges-for-rebuilding-trust-in-the-cdc/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20CDC%20director%20Susan,trust%20among%20partisans%20going%20forward."&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, 85 percent of Americans trusted the CDC to provide reliable information about vaccines, per KFF polling. By &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;October 2025&lt;/a&gt;, that share had fallen to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the worst measles outbreak in years &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;took hold&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas earlier this year, local health officials were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/"&gt;losing their federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and getting limited support at best from the CDC while Kennedy waffled on the value of vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation"&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; unproven treatments such as cod liver oil. As Milwaukee contended with a lead poisoning crisis in its school buildings, its residents had no one in Washington to call, because the relevant team &lt;a href="/public-health/413352/donald-trump-rfk-milwaukee-schools-lead-poisoning"&gt;had been fired&lt;/a&gt;. Whooping cough is back and worse than it’s been in years as vaccination rates fall. Kennedy has been mum on the issue, despite &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5501601-cassidy-kennedy-whooping-cough-louisiana/"&gt;pleas&lt;/a&gt; from Republican senators to weigh in publicly and affirm the value of the whooping cough vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re a deeply divided country, specifically on the subject of &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; health. And that means a lot of your neighbors aren’t going to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="heres-how-you-can-navigate-this-sickness-season-in-these-unusual-times" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Here’s how you can navigate this sickness season in these unusual times&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you are concerned about your &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; health, what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Let’s start by talking about risk. Much of the backlash to the various pandemic interventions — things like masking and issuing vaccine mandates — was founded in different people’s differing risk assessments and risk tolerance. You would hear it all the time from the opponents of those measures: Why should a young man with no serious health problems be &lt;em&gt;required &lt;/em&gt;to get a shot? Many people today find the traditional public health argument — because he might unwittingly pass it along to another person who is more vulnerable — unpersuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, to be fair, it is true that certain people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a much higher risk of Covid, or flu, or RSV than others do — and their choices and behaviors during what most of us call the cold and flu season can reasonably differ. No two people are exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That is simply the reality we are living in: individual health, not public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, your seasonal strategy should start with assessing your own risk. If you are 25 years old with no children and minimal exposure to the elderly, you may decide it’s reasonable to take chances on, for example, going out in public when flu activity is high in your area. If you’re a 65-year-old with a chronic health condition or a compromised immune system, you might not be willing to take the same risks; at least, you might want to think about wearing a mask if there are a lot of Covid or RSV cases in your community. If you are, like me, the 38-year-old parent of three, you might fall somewhere in between the two poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Think about your own situation and the people you come into contact with every day and use that as a guide by which you can evaluate your risk and make decisions. Get on the same page with the people in your life you see regularly: your family, friends and coworkers. You don’t have to completely agree on your risk tolerance to be open and transparent about your mindset as we head into the season. If there are certain dealbreakers — like, &lt;em&gt;I don’t want you to come to my house if you have a runny nose or fever&lt;/em&gt; — talk about how you’ll handle those situations in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;From that baseline, you need reliable information as the winter goes on and viral activity starts to pick up. Start local. Most people &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they have much more trust in their personal doctor than they do in major medical organizations, including the CDC. If you have a primary care doctor, or you can find one, they will be a reliable source whom you can speak to face to face or over a telehealth call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you don’t have a primary physician, or you simply want to educate yourself on what leading medical authorities are saying, you can check out the recommended vaccinations for children under 18 from &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. Different state groups — one on &lt;a href="https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le-1157350.pdf"&gt;the West Coast&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; — are issuing their own vaccine recommendations for adults. The West Coast Health Alliance, for example, advises all adults over 65 to get a Covid shot, people under 65 with certain risk factors, and all adults who are in contact with high-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your insurance coverage could be different this year, too, after the changes to vaccine guidance made by the Trump administration. Kennedy’s health department has scaled back the official government vaccine guidance to “individual decision making” — once again, you’re on your own — and that could affect some insurers’ willingness to cover the cost of a Covid shot. You could call your health plan in advance to find out if it will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And otherwise, keep an eye on what’s happening in your community. State governments often publish infectious disease dashboards with up-to-date data, and local health departments usually send out advisories when local case loads are high. I live in Ohio, and &lt;a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/summary-of-infectious-diseases-in-ohio"&gt;here’s what my local source looks like&lt;/a&gt;. Resources like this will help you understand the specifics of how illnesses are moving through your own community so that you can then weigh your risk and — if you choose — adjust your behavior accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;You can still build a disease-resilient community this winter. But it’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOeV85RzFneHNqWFJBczNMV3lhbEtOVUxQZGxOR1FQMUN6M0liRmZHekk4Yi1aMWdkNWJLUkpNM1V5aVExOGJ6VDRnT2xsLVlOaVZMaFpFNkJKaXNWT2tHNzlRbHBqUVNJQXFiWnMyazlYQThqZF9MdnY2TzBScGdqaA</guid></item><item><title>新的研究揭示了“成年”大脑阶段实际何时开始—而且比你想象的要晚得多- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brain-changes-by-age-adolescence-32_l_692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When does adulthood actually start?

The findings show that the human brain has five phases throughout a lifespan, and researchers say they are all broken up by age — 9, 32, 66 and 83, on average. Researchers referred to these ages as “turning points” when the brain rewires and goes through age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The childhood brain, a time of high growth, lasts through roughly age 9, when it then changes to the adolescent brain, which continues until 32. Yes, 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that someone who is in the later part of this adolescent brain phase is going to act like a teenager, Dr. Alexa Mousley, the study leader, told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Guardian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it means their brains simply resemble each other as they continue to grow and form until the adult brain phase is reached. This adolescent brain phase is the only time when brain efficiency is consistently increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study authors said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;study authors said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age 32 also marks the “strongest shift” of all of the brain changes. Around this time, the brain goes into its adult era ― the longest phase ― which lasts until roughly age 66. During the adult era, or adult “epoch” as researchers call these phases, there is a “plateau in intelligence and personality,” the study &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="press release states" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;press release states&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning, brain function stays pretty much the same for these decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 66, the brain changes, and it moves into the “early aging” phase, which does not have dramatic changes, but the brain does show “further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate,” Mousley said in a press release. This aligns with the physical health issues that often start to appear in the 60s, Mousley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension,” Mousley said in the statement. Hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) can put you at higher risk of stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cognitive decline." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cognitive decline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final epoch starts at 83 and is known as “late aging,” which is a time when brain connectivity reduces and there is more reliance on specific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gather this data, researchers looked at a number of factors, including brain compartmentalization, along with the changes and deterioration of the nerve fibers in the brains of 3,802 people ages 0 to 90 via data from MRI scans. All participants were described as “neurotypical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have limitations. The late-aging group of people was smaller than the other groups. More, participants in all groups had to meet certain health criteria, which may make them healthier than the general public. This could mean that study participants’ brain functionality may be more optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The brain does not reach adulthood until about age 32, according to a new study.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain changes are inevitable as you age, but there are things you can do to keep your brain healthy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain health is a major concern for people as they grow older, especially with more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="6 million Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; having a dementia diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Forgetting things here and there" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Forgetting things here and there&lt;/a&gt; is no major cause for concern as you get older, but if those memory issues disrupt your life, you should talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things you can do to help keep your brain as optimal as possible throughout your lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy habits, overall, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can help reduce dementia risk factors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;can help reduce dementia risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time.

Its potential for abuse was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590014009055"&gt;recognized even then&lt;/a&gt;, and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-reports-decline-in-us-drug-overdose-deaths.html"&gt;24 percent decline&lt;/a&gt; in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name. (It was previously registered as Ovax but switched names in January.) “This is something that could completely change the paradigm of how we deal with overdose, because it doesn’t require someone to be carrying the treatment on them,” Gage says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Opioid vaccines were initially proposed in the 1970s, but after early attempts at heroin vaccines failed, much of the research was abandoned. The modern opioid epidemic has led to a resurgence of interest, with &lt;a href="https://heal.nih.gov/about/research-plan"&gt;backing from the US government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNZGVjME9BRk9LclB1ZjMwcUtWcDJiZkNSd212Z2dUUE9obDFsNmUtVWMxU1JuMkdVZk1TM0tMMWJkdHQ1Vm92NXlVY1dROFBZQUh3dmtUUy02c2RlZl90eWNlT3Q1UjhFd2xsR3BPZVFmUkR0OFZIRDdDQ0p2dHpFX0pUdHQ1dXNNNTN1eg</guid></item><item><title>前疾控中心官员辞职后返回当地医疗保健- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/03/former-cdc-official-public-health-failing-demetre-daskalakis-interview/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demetre Daskalakis likens his former colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to “hostages.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re sitting there doing their work — they’re creating presentations, they’re analyzing data, they’re doing the surveillance,” said Daskalakis, a former top official at the CDC who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; this summer along with two other leaders. “But then you have someone above who is making sweeping decisions without process and putting them on the CDC website as if they were gospel truth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was a reference to the agency, at the direction of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;reversing its stance&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines don’t cause autism, a move that Daskalakis said would have caused him to quit if he hadn’t already. He was with the agency for more than four years, beginning in the last days of the first Trump administration as the director of the Division of HIV Prevention. In 2022, he helped lead the White House’s mpox response. By the second Trump administration, he was serving as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite Kennedy’s long record of anti-vaccine rhetoric, Daskalakis was initially &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/cdc-vaccine-daskalakis.html?showTranscript=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optimistic&lt;/a&gt; about the potential for good public health policy. The feeling didn’t last. As Kennedy led mass layoffs and began making unilateral decisions — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; an entire vaccine advisory panel, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/kennedy-names-new-acip-members-cdc-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;handpicking&lt;/a&gt; the new members, changing Covid-19 shot &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; — Daskalakis grew to believe science was being superseded by ideology. He began compiling a list of reasons that made it hard to stay in the job. The final straw wasn’t the shooting on CDC campus in early August, which sent bullets directly through his own unoccupied office windows. It was later that month, after the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;ousting&lt;/a&gt; of then-Director Susan Monarez. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enough is enough,” he wrote in his resignation letter, citing Kennedy’s undermining of the agency and vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician, is taking his skills back to the city where they were honed working in HIV clinics and as deputy commissioner of the New York City health department. Starting in February, he’ll serve as the chief medical officer of the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, the LGBTQ+ clinic announced Wednesday. He’ll also serve on the transition team for incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As long as there’s a will to destroy public health, it’s going to be really hard to fix it,” Daskalakis said in an interview about his decision to move on from the CDC. “I feel more confident that my ability to help the community is best served closer to the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis spoke to STAT about the importance of local health, how he decided to leave the federal government, and what he thinks about Kennedy’s latest moves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re taking on the role of CMO at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, and you’re also one of a couple dozen people on the health committee within Zohran Mamdani’s transition team. I’m struck by how locally focused both these positions are. What made you interested in these roles after leaving your position at the CDC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My career has taken me from local to federal. I started really doing clinical work in New York City, and learned to do public health as an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital. Then I moved to the Department of Health in New York City and then over to CDC. As I learned more from the local, it became important for me to go to the place [CDC] where that local experience would influence the direction that public health went nationally and, frankly, globally. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an environment where I really don’t think that federal public health is able to actually execute on its mission, this is when it’s time to go back to local. For me, the opportunity to go back to New York City and back to the grassroots front line is extremely appealing. It becomes a local charge to have to execute on the public health mission. And I believe in the work that Callen-Lorde does — LGBTQ work has been at the core of my career in so many different things that I do. And New York City — though I was born in D.C. — is where I grew up from the perspective of my own social awareness as well as public health. And so all of it made sense to go back to my roots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you talk about what your work will look like in each of these roles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We haven’t had our first health subcommittee meeting [for Mamdani], so I will know more when we go. … We’re going to give him the advice that he needs to be able to move forward with a very strong health agenda. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chief medical officer at Callen-Lorde, that’s literally going back to my clinical roots, but also my community roots, so it sort of blends the two. I’ve always seen patients, no matter where I’ve been. When I was running parts of the [New York] Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, I was seeing patients at Mount Sinai. When I was working at CDC, I was seeing patients at Grady Hospital, at the Ponce clinic. So I will be seeing patients at Callen-Lorde, which is exciting. And then as the chief medical officer, I think my job is going to be making sure that the science and the operations are working together in a way that really provides the highest level of care and services to the LGBTQ+ population in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s great about not being at the federal government anymore, is that I’m able to comment on mis- and disinformation. Rather than misinformation, it’s really a lot of distortion. As a physician, as a clinician, and as someone who’s been a public health expert, I feel like my role is to continue to differentiate signal from noise. That’s part of what I’m going to be doing at Callen-Lorde for the community. It’s important for physicians to speak out, and medical providers to speak out, especially when they’re seeing things that are potentially bad for their patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many children’s hospitals have stopped providing gender-affirming care to young people as the Trump administration threatens federal funding — even community health systems similar to Callen-Lorde, like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/10/15/fenway-health-halts-gender-affirming-care-for-patients-under-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fenway Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in Boston. What’s the impact for young patients when that care is removed? And are you worried that Callen-Lorde may make a similar decision at some point? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the base, medical decisions should really be between patients, their families, and medical providers, and should be based on science and free of partisan politics. New York is the right place to be to make sure that we can continue to deliver on that mission. And so that’s why I’m excited to go. Is it going to be simple? No, it’s going to be really complicated. But I’ve never shied away from complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where there’s risk — that’s a place that I really like to work. And so, do I think that the answer is going to be straightforward for Callen-Lorde? No. But what I do know is that they have a legacy of delivering on the mission to serve their community, and so I’m going to be a part of that legacy. I do have all of the appropriate concerns that I think everyone should have in health care right now, because the current regime over health in America is making bad decisions based on ideology. But I also have faith in the leaders of Callen-Lorde, faith in New York City, and then, frankly, the experience to be able to navigate some potentially turbulent waters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You left the CDC in late August when Susan Monarez was ousted from her role as director. Can you walk me through how you made that decision? What factors were you weighing, and was there anything that gave you pause?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My doctor gene is really strong with this one. My main acid test … was if I felt that I was somehow going to do more harm than good. My oath to first do no harm is something that I took very seriously. And as I saw science being sidelined, and ideology not based in science becoming the communication strategy of CDC, I really couldn’t stay there and have my powers be used for evil instead of good, right? Being there as sort of a leader and allowing things like the autism website to go up — I would have quit then as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, my &lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;resignation letter&lt;/a&gt; was not something I wrote in 10 minutes. I’d been compiling a list of the things that were making it hard for me to stay. But each of the things that I listed before the last one were things that we were able to mitigate. When [Kennedy] announced that there was going to be a change to the Covid vaccine schedule for kids and pregnant women, we mitigated the harm of that by working to create the shared clinical decision-making. And frankly, [the administration] is sloppy. So seemingly, they said a [Covid] vaccine shouldn’t be given to a pregnant woman, but then they also said that pregnancy was a risk factor. So that allowed some wiggle where that wasn’t the end of the world. But when it was clear that they were just going to put up conspiracy theories, have presentations that had nothing to do with data that was at all reviewed, that was the end for me, because I couldn’t just sit there and watch. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m sure eventually I would have been fired. But I took the perspective … that my voice is really important in making sure that people know what’s happening. And so I elected to resign without a job, without a prospect for what was next, which really let me share what the inside was like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have there been any moments since leaving the agency that you regretted it, or where you felt like, if you were still there, you could have stopped something that wasn’t based on sound science from happening? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I left, because I found that there was no way to mitigate, because they were circumventing all of it. Let’s go over what happened with the website for autism and vaccines. The scientists were not involved with putting that up. They went around the scientists and they went to the web team and said post it. And so that would have been under my watch. And so rather than regret or going, “Oh, I could have helped fix it,” unfortunately, more than anything, I go into the “I told you so” zone. Because I do feel like as long as there’s a will to destroy public health, it’s going to be really hard to fix it. There’s this ongoing will to try to destabilize it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really feel badly for the folks who are still there and they’re heroes for hanging in, but I’m sure all of them are thinking, “where’s my line?” And I think that’s a decision that you have to make for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But in a recent&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBaDgCN3hRU"&gt; 30-second&lt;/a&gt; commercial, Williams traded the racket for a GLP-1 drug injector pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Williams, whose most recent child was born in 2023, has become a spokeswoman in her post-retirement days for Ro, one of the many boutique health care firms to get in on the GLP-1 craze. “They say GLP-1s for weight loss is a shortcut — it’s not. It’s science,” she says during the spot. “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Patients should be eating a protein-rich, balanced diet and doing some kind of strength training when on an GLP-1 medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Some patients taking GLP-1 drugs have experienced significant muscle loss and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• Experts worry that too many patients may be trying to use GLP-1 drugs as a shortcut instead of improving their diet and exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here is one of the world’s greatest athletes, giving voice — in commercials running during primetime TV, on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7541017696591252749"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNnxUpiuZVs/?hl=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; — to a frustration that many people have felt. She gained weight after she had kids. And even though, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MAYscxxhDE"&gt;in her words&lt;/a&gt;, she was “doing everything right” after the pregnancy, she couldn’t cut as much weight as she liked. That’s where the GLP-1 drug came in and delivered results: Williams lost 31 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s just one problem with the pitch: GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, in some ways, a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Americans always want the fucking pill,” Dr. Robert Lustig, a metabolic scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, told me. “I view GLP-1s like a Band-Aid. … There’s nothing wrong with a Band-Aid. But what if you didn’t clean your wound and you just put the Band-Aid on? The Band-Aid is necessary, but it’s not sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The consequences of patients slapping on the Band-Aid — taking a GLP-1 — without treating the underlying issue with the kind of healthy eating and exercise that are still necessary even with these drugs is becoming clear. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some GLP-1 patients can lose significant muscle mass, as well as a loss of functional strength, due to a lack of energy. Rather than feel fitter and ready to go out in the world or onto the tennis court, these are patients &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;who find walking up the stairs to be almost debilitating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For this story, I sought to understand how this is playing out in American culture. In searching Reddit communities dedicated to GLP-1 drugs, I found lots of normal people whose experience backed up that research: They had long tried to lose weight but could never quite meet their goals — until they went on a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even as they lost weight, they didn’t feel better. Some of them felt worse, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt;weaker&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f56pry/losing_muscle_tone_everywhere_including_pelvic/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 patients &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1i3317w/losing_muscle_mass_like_crazy/"&gt;coming to their peers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt;asking for advice about workouts&lt;/a&gt; they could do &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f2o8pu/muscle_recovery/"&gt;to stem the muscle loss&lt;/a&gt;. A few &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1kop4w5/muscle/"&gt;hope to find the right diet&lt;/a&gt; that will allow them to feel energetic and avoid muscle loss while losing the weight — but without having to commit to strength training that needs to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While the term “strength training” may conjure images of ripped bodybuilders, doctors increasingly emphasize the importance of muscle training for all of their patients, from the 30-year-old marathon runner to the 65-year-old retiree. That’s because research has shown that more &lt;a href="https://cospineandjoint.com/muscle-mass-fall-risk-research/"&gt;lean muscle helps you age better and protects against hazards, such as falls, that pose a greater and greater threat as you get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These drugs are already &lt;a href="/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss"&gt;wildly popular&lt;/a&gt;, and their use is likely to keep growing. In November, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/health/obesity-drug-prices-trump.html"&gt;struck deals&lt;/a&gt; with Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cash price of their drugs in exchange for expanded Medicare coverage. Those price changes, which will begin to take effect next year, could further grow the number of Americans taking these medications, including among seniors for whom &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-guide-to-combatting-sarcopenia-and-preserving-muscle-mass-as-you-get-older"&gt;any loss of muscle mass is a serious health concern&lt;/a&gt;. One quarter of &lt;a href="https://www.ispor.org/docs/default-source/cti-meeting-21021-documents/2258f380-ec14-4bf3-bc24-d6b1f4a0a272.pdf?sfvrsn=585565ec_0"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions dispensed in 2024&lt;/a&gt; were for people older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Falls are already &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/new-old-age-paula-span-falls-mortality-death-older-people-prescription-drugs/"&gt;one of the most potent killers of older adults&lt;/a&gt;; more than 40,000 Americans over 65 died from falls in 2023, and the death rate has tripled since 1990. If more patients start taking semaglutide for its effects on cognition, for example, and fail to eat and exercise properly, they could experience malnourishment and significant muscle loss; both could put their long-term health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That doesn’t mean GLP-1 drugs are a bad deal for public health. On the population level, obesity is &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks"&gt;associated with a host of major ills&lt;/a&gt;, and Americans have long been desperate to lose weight. The class of drugs that includes Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and now countless others — Zepbound, compound GLP-1s, etc. — are the most impressive weight-loss tools we’ve ever seen. They work because they slow digestion and tell your brain you’re full, which makes it easier for people to eat less. While these treatments are still fairly new, observational studies have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/health-rounds-patients-drop-fewer-pounds-with-weight-loss-drugs-real-world-than-2025-06-11/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that patients who stay on these drugs for a year or more can lose 10 percent of their body weight on average. And on the population level, obesity rates are &lt;a href="/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss"&gt;already starting to decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists are also discovering that these drugs have amazing potential to treat a breadth of issues: from addressing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/16/glp1-weight-loss-addiction-drug-alcohol/"&gt;substance-abuse disorders&lt;/a&gt;, lowering &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/evidence-mounts-for-benefit-of-glp-1s-against-heart-disease"&gt;your risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and even potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/popular-diabetes-medications-may-protect-against-alzheimers-disease-uf-researchers-find#:~:text=The%20data%20showed%20a%20statistically,cognitive%20decline%20in%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20patients."&gt;dementia and Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Recent studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251112011810.htm"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taking a GLP-1 like Wegovy or Ozempic is even associated with lower cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But to stem the risk of muscle-mass loss, you must also be willing to commit to improving your diet and adopting a serious workout regimen over the long term. GLP-1 drugs may be magical when it comes to weight loss, but they are not magic pills. Which means that along with the rise of Ozempic and other GLP-1s is a coming reckoning over America’s shortcut culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="is-this-just-a-necessary-evil-to-weight-loss" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plenty of athletes who are not world-famous see the same appeal in GLP-1 drugs that Serena Williams did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One person in particular stood out to me. A self-identified weight lifter, CrossFit enthusiast, and horse rider, who I’ll call Sam, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ju53r2/muscle_loss/"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; their experience on Reddit. They explained they had always struggled to lose weight despite strict meal preparation and eating a lot of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And so, Sam started taking Wegovy. ”I’m happy with the results,” they said — before getting to a pretty big caveat for somebody who’s always had an active life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite aiming to eat 100 grams of protein every day, they said they were feeling weak. “I swear I can feel my muscle being broken down. Is this a thing??” Sam asked in the online forum. “I actually feel less firm, more wobbly and flabby. I seem to have less definition,“ they said. “Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="why-i-reported-this-story" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I reported this story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;GLP-1 drugs are undeniably exciting, and they are being widely adopted. I recently found out a family member of my own had started taking them, and they’re not the kind of person who’s susceptible to diet fads either. As a reporter, that makes me nervous: Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;It would be wonderful if GLP-1 drugs could cure Alzheimer’s, but we probably need to think through the trade-offs. And I started to pick up from other reporting and social media feeds I follow that some people were experiencing this unexpected muscle loss. I thought it would be valuable to unpack the science to explain why this happens to some people and explain what they can do to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The internet is filled with examples just like this. “Anyone else having a hard time working out on Wegovy?” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f2o8pu/muscle_recovery/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; one Reddit poster last year. They even felt their arms were weaker while bowling. Another person &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1lgawf4/comment/myvkodv/"&gt;realized&lt;/a&gt; something was wrong when they could no longer do yard work around the house. Other people have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; leg weakness after light walking or climbing the stairs: “I actually struggle to go up a staircase and I’m only 32,” said one GLP-1 patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I know a lot of people are working out, and I do need to begin exercising on top of the wegovy, but I’m just wondering if anyone else is experiencing extreme weakness or if it’s just me and my un-toned self,” they asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Sam’s post in particular had a lot of comments, with one respondent even urging the patient to reconsider: You are “a strong, capable goddess. You don’t need to lose weight.” Accept who you are. In response, Sam laid out the dilemma that so many people who have sought to lose weight over the years face: “Unfortunately, some of us just do NOT lose weight with diet and exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s true: Weight loss is not assured from diet and exercise. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573068/"&gt;have a genetic disposition&lt;/a&gt; to becoming obese. And not everybody who is obese is unhealthy; the body mass index is an imperfect measurement, and some people who are technically obese can still be healthy if much of their weight is muscle. Still, the realization that obesity is a disease to be treated, rather than a personal failure that can only be remedied through personal growth, has been important in reducing the prejudices that overweight people have long faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But at the same time, it is a slippery slope from acknowledging diet and exercise may not be sufficient on their own to thinking a drug like Ozempic can make them unnecessary. Some people, like Sam, have always exercised and viewed GLP-1s as an extra push to help them reach their weight goals. But I also encountered other people who did not necessarily have healthy habits before but were able with the drugs to cut weight for the first time. One patient on Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ee76tc/about_muscle_loss/"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that they don’t work out and they don’t adhere to a particular diet. They have been losing weight, but they are “scared” about losing too much weight — so they ask if they can just eat more chicken or drink a protein shake and regain the muscle “without working out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have reason for concern: The same clinical trials that have shown how effective GLP-1 drugs are with weight loss have also consistently reported muscle loss or weakness among patients. When one group of researchers evaluated the type of body mass that patients on semaglutide drugs were losing, they &lt;a href="https://ir.verupharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/225/veru-announces-positive-topline-data-from-phase-2b-quality"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that about 40 percent was important muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The GLP-1 market is only going to grow as the drugs prove useful for a wide array of treatments. People, including those who are not overweight, may take them preventively to stave off cardiovascular disease or dementia. For them, people who are already at a healthy weight, muscle loss is an even more serious concern. If GLP-1 drugs do prove to be promising for treating age-related cognitive decline, for example, then appropriate diet and exercise will be even more paramount for that patient population. The last thing we want is more seniors suffering catastrophic injuries during a fall because of lost muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But understanding what exactly is causing the muscle loss is important. Scientists are still figuring that out, but early indications are that the cause is not the drugs themselves, then some of the lifestyle changes the drugs can lead to..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One study from researchers at the University of Utah suggests the loss of strength is largely the result of not eating enough calories. In their research on mice, they &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/08/new-study-raises-questions-about-how-ozempic-affects-muscle-size-and-strength"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; less muscle mass loss than expected. Instead, after taking a GLP-1, mice were losing their functional strength — how much they could lift or move around — even when muscle size stayed the same. In other words, the mice appeared weaker even though their muscle mass hadn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Strength is not just a factor of how much muscle you have, but whether you can move that muscle effectively. There’s an energetic component to it,” lead author Katsu Funai told me. The animals on a GLP-1 drug may have had less energy because they were eating less — and therefore they wouldn’t be able to exert as much force with their muscles. It’s not the GLP-1s per se; it’s what the GLP-1s lead to without intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The findings could inform how we prescribe Ozempic, Funai said: Smaller doses might help to mitigate the loss of functional strength. Otherwise, losing weight too quickly is going to mean losing &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; quickly — and therefore feeling weaker. In the excitement over Ozempic, and the potential to lose a lot of weight and fast, people seem to have forgotten a fundamental truth about weight loss: “More is not necessarily better,” Funai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Before GLP-1 drugs existed at all, dieticians urged their patients to pace weight loss — no more than 1-2 pounds per week — for exactly this reason: You don’t want to end up malnourished and weakened. With a conventional diet, that can often lead to you eating more, which in turn eliminates the weight loss. But when your appetite is suppressed by GLP-1s, the weight loss can continue, and with it, strength and energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“With these GLP-1s, that conversation [about diet and exercise] has been sidelined,” Funai said. “There are nuances to these things that I think are being missed not just from the public, but also from scientists,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-make-the-most-of-glp-1s" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to make the most of GLP-1s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ironically, the very problem that GLP-1s were meant to overcome — that many Americans simply struggle to eat right and exercise enough — remains just as central even with the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And many of the people taking GLP-1s are starting at a disadvantage: Only 49 percent of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/05/07/americans-on-healthy-food-and-eating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they are extremely or very confident that they know what a healthy diet looks like, and about twice as many &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2017/02/02/americans-health-care-behaviors-and-use-of-conventional-and-alternative-medicine-2/#:~:text=Two%2Dthirds%20(66%25)%20of,say%20it%20is%20somewhat%20important"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they should get more exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If your sole goal is to lose weight, a GLP-1 alone could get you there — but not in the healthiest way. Unless you change what you eat, you’re still putting the same junk in your body — albeit less of it — with the same or more negative effects on your energy and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If you don’t change your behavior, if you don’t change your habits, you may be looking good, you may be losing weight, but metabolically, your body is in turmoil,” said Nayan Patel, a pharmacist who works with patients taking the drugs. “We’ve got to use these drugs in the right manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So what should people on GLP-1s aim to eat? A high-protein diet delivering a lot of amino acids is important, Patel said: Eggs, nuts, lentils, poultry, and fish are all good sources. You can cut down on the carbs and sugars; your body won’t need them to produce energy because you’ll be cutting fat. Eating protein and strength training allows your body to be more effective at trimming the fat, without compromising your core strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Like anything hard but worth doing, there’s a lot to overcome. Many Americans have become intimidated by gym culture, so they might prefer to work out in privacy, at home — but they don’t know how. One person I encountered posted online to crowdsource advice on home equipment and routines. They said they didn’t want to go to a gym, but “I know I’m out of shape,” the poster confessed to&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt; their fellow Redditors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The thread flooded with advice from simple workout routines to try to role models they could follow on social media. The advice included some very approachable strategies — something as simple as sitting in a chair with your legs outstretched and using your abdominal muscles to lift them from side to side over a water bottle. Some commenters recommended incorporating a resistance band and a workout ball. Health care providers have developed general recommendations for patients taking a GLP-1 drug: Mass General, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/fitness-for-people-taking-glp-1-agonists"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; a mixture of 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise — activities like walking or riding a bike — &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; about 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise like jogging or swimming laps in addition to two days of weight training and a steady dose of stretching and flexibility workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While I found plenty of people concerned with unexpected muscle loss, there were also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1e5gycg/when_people_say_people_on_ozempic_and_wegovy_have/"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of patients proudly showing off their lean and muscular new physiques.

These meetings are normally technical, evidence-based, and grounded in predictable procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in recent months, in a shift fueled by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;growing influence over the committee&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;CDC’s public-facing materials&lt;/a&gt;, ACIP has drifted toward something more concerning: inflating speculative risks while downplaying well-established vaccine benefits. This imbalance has already surfaced in procedural irregularities, unsupported proposals, and confusing CDC communications, with the potential to disrupt vaccine access and public confidence at a time of rising infectious disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has positioned himself as a champion of scientific rigor and radical transparency. Yet his early actions at the CDC tell a different story. He &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/21/rfk-jr-ordered-vaccines-autism-cdc-website-change/"&gt;personally ordered&lt;/a&gt; revisions to CDC vaccine-safety webpages and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;announced changes to Covid-19 vaccine guidance&lt;/a&gt; — without new evidence and without CDC subject-matter review. These unilateral moves bypass the scientific guardrails and rigor he claims to value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result: CDC publications now introduce ambiguity where none exists. ACIP, though technically independent, can’t ignore an official website that implies uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;long-settled science on vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has effectively created a policy-shaping source document that carries the CDC seal without CDC oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;June meeting&lt;/a&gt; offered the first signs of a committee losing its footing. New members revisited and re-voted on issues the following day, evidence frameworks were sidelined, and voting language was drafted on the fly rather than through the normal public comment process. The September meeting went off the rails with impromptu presentations of data that lacked substantial evidence or peer review. When a scientific body stops following its own procedures, rigor and transparency both slip, and public trust erodes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The only formal vote at the Dec. 4-5 meeting involves the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/02/cdc-acip-meeting-hepatitis-b-shots-vaccine-integrity-project/"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine birth dose&lt;/a&gt;. However, loosely defined sessions on “CDC Vaccine Risk Monitoring Evaluation,” “Vaccine Schedule History,” and the “Childhood/Adolescent Immunization Schedule” could invite misapplied risk framing, especially given the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;CDC website’s new, ambiguous language&lt;/a&gt; that mirrors terminology previously seen on a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/fake-cdc-vaccine-site-linked-anti-vax-nonprofit-once-headed-rfk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“fake CDC website” linked to anti-vaccine groups&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the committee takes no drastic action, raising fringe concerns in an official forum can legitimize their ideological questions, an increasingly common tactic among newer members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Misguided discussions don’t remain theoretical. They shape public perception, influence future votes, and trigger ripple effects in vaccine supply and coverage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Altering the hepatitis B birth dose could destabilize the entire childhood schedule. Combination vaccines that include hepatitis B depend on stable timing. If timing shifts, combination products may become unusable, forcing a return to single-dose formulations that the U.S. currently lacks the capacity to produce. Manufacturing new standalone vaccines could take months to years, leaving gaps in protection and risking increases in hepatitis B and other vaccine preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum, a critical adjuvant component of many routine childhood vaccines with decades of safety data, remains a favorite target among those alleging undefined dangers. Removing adjuvants would require new formulations, clinical trials, and regulatory review, jeopardizing availability of vaccines for hepatitis A and B, HPV, pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such instability could send manufacturers a clear signal that the U.S. is no longer a predictable environment for vaccine production leading to fewer manufacturers and fewer available vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s revised vaccine-autism language, while not explicitly claiming causation, strongly implies that science cannot rule it out. This rhetorical device contradicts extensive evidence and opens the door for petitions to add autism to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) injury table, potentially unleashing tens of thousands of claims unsupported by science. VICP, the system that provides financial compensation to people who have been seriously injured by certain vaccines, could be depleted, and manufacturers might reconsider continuing in the U.S. market. This is more than poor communication; it sets the stage for litigation that undermines both science and vaccine access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reversing this trend in vaccine policy requires immediate and coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the scientific community must reaffirm the proven benefits of routine vaccination, especially the hepatitis B birth dose, which prevents infections from mothers, caregivers, and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, professional societies and public health organizations should prepare clear statements countering misconceptions likely to surface during or after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, CDC leadership must restore scientific credibility by ensuring website content reflects peer-reviewed evidence, not political pressure or manufactured ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health institutions now face a choice: reinforce trust through evidence-based practice or erode it by elevating speculation over science. The path forward is clear: follow evidence, uphold process, communicate clearly, and keep the mission focused on protecting the health of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming ACIP meeting, the committee must resist raising hypothetical risks not grounded in rigorous science, while burying real, lifesaving benefits. The country deserves better — and our public health system depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

Tail swishing like it’s trying to keep time with the beat in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Halfway there, she pauses and tells him to sit. He drops into position right away, still behaving himself, eyes locked on the bowl. She jokes that “the whole internet thinks I’m starving you by not giving you cookies,” and honestly, Loofy doesn’t help his case — he looks like a dog who could win an Oscar for “Most Convincingly Hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once the bowl finally hits the stand, she gives him a quick scritch. And he dives in with the enthusiasm of someone who’s been waiting hours, not minutes. It’s no wonder the video has racked up 8.9k likes. The whole thing is just sweet, simple joy, wrapped in one dinner dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comments agree: “GOOODBOOOOOOOY,” “He is adorable!!,” and our favorite — “I thank you my hooman for my food with a little dance.” It fits him perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/198123-golden-retriever-dance-food-mom-video-cute" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Does Little Dancy Dance as Mom Serves Food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Does Little Dancy Dance as Mom Serves Food&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:05:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNaThUcXdNS05TcXNwdXk5RzNtTE1udVJaVW9nZE1XQkl4ZjljVDdteGpUSHo3NG41NjFJaUQxcUFnY2tqdjJYWnIwZ1FERFVycGp0aFlocTJlOUx0YXE0UHlpVDBLWHpwTEpkSk1oMldOcHp1WlR5UUs2RGNuSmF0cUc2ZlBIVFlFQmVUcjJTRGlHaVda</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心顾问可能会推翻新生儿乙型肝炎疫苗的建议- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisers-reverse-newborn-hepatitis-b-vaccine-recommendations-rcna246812</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d47bc7" class="body-graf"&gt;A group of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to vote on whether the agency should scrap its long-standing recommendation that every baby get a hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40256c" class="body-graf"&gt;The shot — universally recommended for newborns in the U.S since the early 1990s — is credited with &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;driving down cases of acute hepatitis B infections in kids by 99%&lt;/a&gt;. The virus, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-282263" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite its success, the hepatitis B vaccine has become the latest target of skeptics who question whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-664094" class="body-graf"&gt;A vaccine given on “day one has a risk of neonatal fever, which causes more interventions” like blood work to determine the cause of the fever, said Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who practices at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c49b14" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since June, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired all of its members&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with his own appointees. On Monday, Milhoan was named the new ACIP chair, replacing Martin Kuldorff, a biostatistician who &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-appointed-cdc-vaccine-panel-says-will-scrutinize-childhood-vac-rcna214941" target="_blank"&gt;previously cast doubt on childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including the one for hepatitis B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4096bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he has never seen a serious reaction after “thousands of babies” have been given the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e52e33" class="body-graf"&gt;“I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,” O’Leary said at a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bddc" class="body-graf"&gt;And a review of more than 400 studies found no evidence that the birth dose of the vaccines causes any short- or long-term health problems. On the contrary, the review of research, published Tuesday by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/groups-organize-form-unbiased-independent-vaccine-panel-rcna212468" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of experts led by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, found that giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine has prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations. The paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478148" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday. The committee makes recommendations to the CDC director, who can then choose whether to adopt them. While a vote against newborn vaccination does not prohibit doctors from administering the shot, the panel’s recommendations influence insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41d92" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the ACIP members would vote to eliminate or delay that first dose of a hepatitis B vaccine by a month or two. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda posted online as of Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; described the meeting in broad strokes, offering no details about who would be presenting data. A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;vote on the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to take place at an ACIP meeting in September, but it was tabled because of confusion among committee members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e92349" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and sharing drug paraphernalia, such as needles. It can also pass from person to person if they share common household items such as toothbrushes or razors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79ce28" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan said any decision to give newborns hepatitis B vaccines should be made based on clinicians’ individual assessments of the babies’ risk for infection — that is, whether a pregnant woman tests positive for the infection or has a “questionable infectious disease background.” At September’s ACIP meeting, the panel voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3674af" class="body-graf"&gt;But not all pregnant women receive prenatal care, and if they do, not all feel comfortable speaking frankly with their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14553c" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan appeared to dismiss the argument that women may not divulge activities that could increase their risk for hepatitis B because of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74bf85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I hope they love their baby more than they love their pride,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e56dd" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2738558" target="_blank"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; showed that just 84% to 88% of pregnant women are tested for the virus. Without vaccination, 90% of babies exposed to the hepatitis B virus during birth develop chronic hepatitis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/#:~:text=Newborns%20infected%20with%20hepatitis%20B,will%20die%20from%20the%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f0b12" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine is not the only immunization Milhoan has cast doubt on. He is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance — formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance — a group that has advocated for unproven treatments for Covid. His &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the IMA’s website&lt;/a&gt; says he “is dedicated to treating patients affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, Long Covid, and vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.” Last year, he participated in an &lt;a href="https://crescentcitytimes.com/special-event-covid-hearings/" target="_blank"&gt;event with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt;, R-Ga., about alleged injuries associated with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b55413" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been especially critical of Covid vaccines for their link to a small but increased risk of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/heart-issues-common-covid-infection-vaccination-cdc-reports-rcna21558" target="_blank"&gt;heart condition called myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; in young men. The link was not seen in clinical trials; it was detected in 2021, soon after the shots were made available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae0a52" class="body-graf"&gt;“The rates of myocarditis were much higher than anyone thought,” Milhoan said. He said he was labeled an “anti-vaxxer” for speaking out about the potential risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191097" class="body-graf"&gt;“People were saying, ‘Are you against the vaccines?’ I’m just trying to show you what we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a085c" class="body-graf"&gt;Over the weekend, Dr. Vinay Prasad, the vaccine chief at the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccines-children-deaths-rcna246437" target="_blank"&gt;told staff members in a memo that an internal review&lt;/a&gt; found that at least 10 children died “after and because of” Covid vaccines and suggested the deaths were tied to myocarditis. Prasad did not provide any evidence to back up the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d25dfc" class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have shown that myocarditis is more commonly associated with Covid infection than vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c47b3" class="body-graf"&gt;This week’s ACIP meeting is also expected to include discussion of the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. The ingredient is added to prompt the immune system to react better to vaccines. A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;study of more than 1 million people&lt;/a&gt;, published over the summer, found that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum adjuvants were not linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15d89e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The meeting follows months of upheaval within the CDC, including mass firings and significant changes to its messaging. On Nov. 19, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC webpage&lt;/a&gt; that once stated unequivocally that vaccines do not cause autism &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;was rewritten&lt;/a&gt; to suggest, without evidence, that health officials had “ignored” possible links between the shots and the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVFJVVnhlMFlzUXk3dGsyTmxPQWdWSFZ4SHdJZm9acGtVX3Z6cmdoS3M4YnYxRE85TERBVXJBVnpUNE1OQUJDVlkwNjk3bWIzZGx4bkF3MGkzcjFwMThzZ2djZTRGSlpDRV96cHd3TGg1b2FHNnBLZzlrOUZVdHNTX1hQRVhQd190NzhfUkVJTUgzVWZmcXFHRmJlQWNkSWZ1blVZbmo3MDItWnNHOG9XeHpHLTJIV0ZRVWfSAVZBVV95cUxQR2FBRFhLLTZsbkhhYUtlQXlBTXJmd0ZqQ29fSE9yeG9VaTRIc2N5TXkxbmFlelVQZEw3OVpfaktWQ3pKaTZLRTlpdm8yMWd5UHYzX0JqUQ</guid></item><item><title>医生警告推迟为新生儿注射乙型肝炎疫苗可能会重现致命的威胁- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5629005/acip-hepatitis-b-rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-liver-failure-newborns</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Working out of a &lt;a href="https://anmc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tribal-owned hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon can still hear his voice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'" he recalled. "We were all crying." The boy died at home a week later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article/11/5/446/180718/Improving-Timeliness-of-Hepatitis-B-Vaccine-Birth" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;90% effective&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;98% of them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/ask-experts/topic/hepb/vaccine-recommendations-hepb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;30 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12549388/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the number of cases plummeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Liver cancer has disappeared in children," McMahon said. "We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Pushing Back the Dose?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to discuss and vote on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a "likely culprit" of autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He also said the hepatitis B virus is not "casually contagious." But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades of research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;up to states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to do that. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/29/nx-s1-5624998/fda-vaccines-covid-children-safety" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changes to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/3042d15c-676b-48ac-8148-1a2204ef420e.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;internal agency emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Prasad questioned the routine practice of "giving multiple vaccines at the same time." It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birth dose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Contacted for comment, Health and Human Services spokesman Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement that "ACIP will review the evidence at its meeting this week and issue recommendations based on gold standard, evidence-based science and common sense."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Sowing Distrust'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-debate-cdc-birth-dose-exposure-risk-acip-vote/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/media/HepBSexualHealth.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more infectious&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3973412/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study in the 1970s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a very infectious virus," McMahon said. "That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The three-dose vaccine has a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long track record&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2004/07000/lack_of_association_between_hepatitis_b_birth.12.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2001/11000/safety_of_neonatal_hepatitis_b_vaccine.9.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever or sepsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571612" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17192842/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autoimmune conditions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and severe reactions are rare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have an incredible safety profile," O'Leary said. "No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%202%20people%20with%20hepatitis%20B%20do%20not%20know%20they%20are%20infected." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;do not know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few to no symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure. Treatment can sometimes involve &lt;a href="https://www.hepatitisb.uw.edu/go/hbv/medications-used-to-treat-hbv/core-concept/all" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antiviral or immunomodulatory medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if the benefits outweigh the risk of severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Expert's Advice to Parents: Talk to a Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some parents may struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors, said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those perceptions, Schaffner said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280122/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;liver cancer reduced by 84%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver," Schaffner said. "It's too late to prevent that infection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;More hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;main adverse events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile — for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The data are so clear about this," Schaffner said. "A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; , a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

She was inspired by innovative molecular tools that would allow her to investigate the contributions of another, more mysterious group of cells called astrocytes. What she discovered about their role in learning and memory excited her even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03633-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51778150.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The computers that run on human brain cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, she felt like an outsider, especially at conferences. She imagined colleagues thinking, “Oh, that’s the weird one who works on astrocytes,” says Goshen, whose laboratory is at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A lot of people were sceptical, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not any more. A rush of studies from labs in many subfields are revealing just how important these cells are in shaping our behaviour, mood and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03366-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03366-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. Long thought of as support cells, astrocytes are emerging as key players in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurons and neural circuits are the main &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;computing units of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now clear just how much astrocytes shape that computation,” says neurobiologist Nicola Allen at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, who has spent her career researching astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells, collectively called glial cells. “Glial meetings are now consistently oversubscribed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Out of the shadows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far back as the nineteenth century, scientists could see with their simple microscopes that mammalian brains included two major &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03073-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03073-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;types of cell&lt;/a&gt; — neurons and glia — in roughly equal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century technologies generated most of the excitement around neurons. Researchers studying the cells’ electrical activity showed how they create the complex networks that underlie all brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When neurons are activated, electrical signals zap down their length at lightning speed, causing their synapses to release chemical neurotransmitters. Some of these, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;glutamate&lt;/a&gt;, excite neighbouring neurons, whereas others, such as GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), inhibit them. The development of a technique called patch clamping in the 1970s and 1980s, in which electrodes are inserted into individual cells to measure the flow of ions across membranes, let researchers probe this neurotransmission in unprecedented detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01468-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51349062.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain tissues, assemble! Inside the push to build better brain models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, glial cells seemed to be electrically silent and were dismissed as dull by most researchers. Some glia, called oligodendrocytes, coat and insulate neurons. Others, the microglia, provide the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01502-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01502-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;brain’s immune system&lt;/a&gt;. The many functions of astrocytes proved more elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although few brain scientists focused on astrocytes until well into the 2000s, some fundamental discoveries were made before that&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Under the light microscope, astrocytes look star-shaped, stretching between neurons and tiny blood vessels in the brain. They signal blood vessels to increase or decrease their flow according to neuronal activity and extract oxygen and other life-giving molecules from the blood to ship to neurons. They clear up waste products from around the synapses and regulate ion levels there. They extract glutamate from around the neurons to stop the excitatory circuits from going into overdrive, break the neurotransmitter down and then return its building blocks to the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes started to look more interesting when it became possible to measure calcium movements in cells. Those measurements revealed that astrocytes use fluctuations in their calcium levels to signal to each other and to other cells in response to certain molecules in their environment, such as an excess of neurotransmitters (see ‘Signals from the stars’). These calcium signals, which move slowly compared with those that pass between neurons, turn out to have big consequences. They drive many activities, including the release of further signalling molecules, ions, metabolites and other factors that affect how neurons, other glial cells and blood vessels behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51771876.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51771876.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Signals from the stars.

But over the past decade or so, ever-more-precise research tools have revealed a different, more complex story. Many scientists who had previously focused exclusively on neurons are now using these tools to investigate how astrocytes contribute to animal physiology and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No evidence emerged to support a role for astrocytes in ultrafast neurotransmission. Instead, it is becoming ever clearer that astrocytes orchestrate the molecular mix in the environment around synapses on timescales much slower than neuronal signalling, varying that mix according to brain state — how alert or awake the brain is, for example. This, in turn, can determine whether neurons fire in response to a signal coming across the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in microscopy have shown just how closely astrocytes are associated with neurons. Beyond their star-shaped core, astrocytes have an intricate architecture with many branches that extend into tiny, delicate structures, called leaflets, that are only tens of nanometres wide. At this resolution, astrocytes, which make up one-quarter of all brain cells, look less like stars and more like bushy spheres, and they fill all the available space between neurons without overlapping with each other&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the human brain, each astrocyte can contact up to two million synapses. What’s more, there are different types of astrocyte in different brain areas&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03641-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51778156.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;First-ever atlas of brain development shows how stem cells turn into neurons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vast reach of astrocytes has profound consequences in the brain, says neuroscientist Baljit Khakh at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Form follows function in biology.” His lab has developed many of the molecular and genetic tools that allow particular calcium signalling pathways in astrocytes to be switched on or off, letting scientists see what each pathway does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons might transmit the signals that drive brain function, but it is now clear that astrocytes fine-tune those signals by altering the environment around the synapses, says neuroscientist Hongkui Zeng, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That is why it is important to learn about all brain cells, not just the neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clocks, learning and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As just one example, astrocytes resolved an open question in the field of circadian biology. How does the body’s master clock, a cluster of cells in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that regulates biological cycles in a roughly 24-hour rhythm, keep its circular loop? “It was a mystery,” says circadian biologist Michael Hastings at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master-clock system is made up almost exclusively of neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and no one could see how a system that apparently does nothing but suppress neuronal activity could create a daily cycle. Biological clocks need a feedback mechanism so that they can generate rhythmic cycles autonomously, without needing an external signal every day to restart them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Marco Brancaccio, a postdoctoral researcher working with Hastings, read about a glutamate detector — a fluorescent probe called ‘glue sniffer’, or iGluSnFR. Brancaccio proposed using the detector to sniff out any glutamate that might be present in the mouse brain slices the team was studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I told Marco it would be a waste of time, because there wouldn’t be any,” recalls Hastings. “Fortunately he ignored me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brancaccio, who is now at Imperial College London, found plenty of glutamate — and to general astonishment, found that its levels were as rhythmic as those of GABA. But whereas the GABA levels were highest during the day, glutamate levels peaked at night&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We scratched our heads. Where could that glutamate be coming from?” says Hastings. It didn’t take them long to discover through a literature search that the source must be astrocytes, a cell type they hadn’t thought much about before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set the researchers on a series of ever-more sophisticated experiments. They ultimately concluded that astrocytes support the SCN clock by switching on their uptake systems for GABA by day and turning them off at night&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Micrograph of clumps of astrocytes which have the appearance of the tops of bushy trees in a forest, with complex branch structures, coloured in greens, yellows, oranges and reds." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Different astrocyte types, with their thousands of branches and leaflets, pack together to fill the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: B. Khakh Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly intriguing are studies that are revealing how astrocytes support the many subtleties of learning and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00292-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00292-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. In one of her first key experiments with the new tools, Goshen and her team were amazed to discover how astrocytes in the brains of mice encode information about the spatial location of rewards. When a mouse had already learnt where to find a water reward, the calcium activity in its astrocytes gradually increased as it approached the reward, the scientists found. But the researchers measured no increase when the mouse moved towards the same reward in a new environment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The finding raises interesting questions about how astrocytes are involved in the encoding of spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, groups in Japan and the United States reported that astrocytes help with the stabilization and recall of memories primed by fear&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because the astrocytes’ signals are much slower than the electrical signals of neurons — sometimes developing over hours or even days rather than milliseconds — they are well suited to bridging the time gap between learning and remembering, says neuroscientist Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Centre for Brain Science in Wako, Japan, who led one of the studies. “Think of them as the brain’s long-exposure camera: they capture the trace of meaningful events that might otherwise fade too fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because neurons and astrocytes work together to process information, researchers have started to wonder whether astrocytes drive or exacerbate diseases that have been generally considered to be neuronal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            The US stillbirth rate dropped 2% last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr041.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a hopeful improvement after a turbulent few years.

            But there were still nearly 20,000 fetal deaths in 2024, CDC data shows, more than 5.4 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00053b6nwq61i6qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That rate is the lowest it’s been in decades, but the CDC does not necessarily consider it to be a record low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip8gck300013b6qen7u96rx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stillbirths have been generally trending down in the US: The rate fell from 7.5 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks in 1990 down to 5.7 in 2019. But the rate ticked up in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and has fluctuated in the years since, and the decline in 2024 essentially brought the stillbirth rate back to where it was in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00063b6nygmi65g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC report, the decline in the stillbirth rate last year was driven by significant change in three states: Colorado, which had a 14% drop; Utah, which had a 16% drop, and Mississippi, which saw a 21% drop in fetal mortality between 2023 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00073b6n40oe2uyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the decrease, Mississippi still has a higher stillbirth rate than any other state, at 7.8, but officials in the state are taking action. Earlier this year, Mississippi declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/infant-mortality-public-health-emergency-mississippi"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; over the rising infant mortality rate. The move creates opportunities to mobilize resources to address the issue, such as investments to activate a standardized system for maternal and infant care and eliminate &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/health/maternity-care-crisis-march-of-dimes"&gt;maternity care deserts&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            And despite the nationwide improvement last year, especially in stillbirths during the third trimester, experts say much more work is needed to continue to bring the stillbirth rate down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00093b6nud32n68x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Stillbirths affect just as many families as do infant deaths each year,” said Ashley Stoneburner, director of applied research and analytics with March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000a3b6nv0y97th3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a really large problem, and a lot of the risk factors that we see for infant mortality, especially very early infant deaths, are the same that we see for babies that are born still,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000b3b6n9teidlpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In September, the US National Institutes of Health launched a five-year, $37 million &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-consortium-reduce-risk-stillbirth-us" target="_blank"&gt;Stillbirth Research Consortium&lt;/a&gt; to support efforts that reduce the risk of stillbirth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5785410/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that about a quarter of stillbirths are preventable, but most — up to 60% – “remain unexplained even after exclusion of common causes, such as congenital abnormalities, genetic factors, and obstetric complications,” NIH said in a news release about the new consortium.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000d3b6ns3vgsdif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ​Other factors that increase the risk for stillbirth include medical conditions among mothers — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and substance use during pregnancy — as well as high levels of stress some environmental exposures including extreme heat and pollution, Stoneburner says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000e3b6n4ar9d3r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of socioeconomic factors that increase the risk for stillbirth as well, and those are things like lack of access to health care or belonging to a certain ethnic minority groups,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000f3b6nniwqji6j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            March of Dimes’ 2025 report card highlighted a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/prenatal-care-us-women-march-of-dimes"&gt;worrisome decline&lt;/a&gt; in the share of pregnant women who are receiving prenatal care in their first trimester and “persistent inequities and rising health risks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The new CDC report shows that stillbirth rates have been consistently highest among mothers who are Black and those who are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Rates of about 10 fetal deaths for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks for these groups are twice as high as they are among mothers who are Asian, White or Hispanic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A noninvasive method for measuring blood glucose levels, developed at MIT, could save diabetes patients from having to prick their fingers several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team used Raman spectroscopy — a technique that reveals the chemical composition of tissues by shining near-infrared or visible light on them — to develop a shoebox-sized device that can measure blood glucose levels without any needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests in a healthy volunteer, the researchers found that the measurements from their device were similar to those obtained by commercial continuous glucose monitoring sensors that require a wire to be implanted under the skin. While the device presented in this study is too large to be used as a wearable sensor, the researchers have since developed a wearable version that they are now testing in a small clinical study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, the finger stick has been the standard method for measuring blood sugar, but nobody wants to prick their finger every day, multiple times a day. Naturally, many diabetic patients are under-testing their blood glucose levels, which can cause serious complications,” says Jeon Woong Kang, an MIT research scientist and the senior author of the study. “If we can make a noninvasive glucose monitor with high accuracy, then almost everyone with diabetes will benefit from this new technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT postdoc Arianna Bresci is the lead author of the new study, which appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;. Other authors include Peter So, director of the MIT Laser Biomedical Research Center (LBRC) and an MIT professor of biological engineering and mechanical engineering; and Youngkyu Kim and Miyeon Jue of Apollon Inc., a biotechnology company based in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noninvasive glucose measurement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most diabetes patients measure their blood glucose levels by drawing blood and testing it with a glucometer, some use wearable monitors, which have a sensor that is inserted just under the skin. These sensors provide continuous glucose measurements from the interstitial fluid, but they can cause skin irritation and they need to be replaced every 10 to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of creating wearable glucose monitors that would be more comfortable for patients, researchers in MIT’s LBRC have been pursuing noninvasive sensors based on Raman spectroscopy. This type of spectroscopy reveals the chemical composition of tissue or cells by analyzing how near-infrared light is scattered, or deflected, as it encounters different kinds of molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, researchers at the LBRC showed that they could indirectly calculate glucose levels based on a comparison between Raman signals from the interstitial fluid that bathes skin cells and a reference measurement of blood glucose levels. While &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2010/glucose-monitor-0809" target="_blank"&gt;this approach&lt;/a&gt; produced reliable measurements, it wasn’t practical for translating to a glucose monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the researchers reported a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/raman-spectroscopy-needle-pricks-diabetics-0124" target="_blank"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to directly measure glucose Raman signals from the skin. Normally, this glucose signal is too small to pick out from all of the other signals generated by molecules in tissue. The MIT team found a way to filter out much of the unwanted signal by shining near-infrared light onto the skin at a different angle from which they collected the resulting Raman signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers obtained those measurements using equipment that was around the size of a desktop printer, and since then, they have been working on further shrinking the footprint of the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, they were able to create a smaller device by analyzing just three bands — spectral regions that correspond to specific molecular features — in the Raman spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a Raman spectrum may contain about 1,000 bands. However, the MIT team found that they could determine blood glucose levels by measuring just three bands — one from the glucose plus two background measurements. This approach allowed the researchers to reduce the amount and cost of equipment needed, allowing them to perform the measurement with a cost-effective device about the size of a shoebox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By refraining from acquiring the whole spectrum, which has a lot of redundant information, we go down to three bands selected from about 1,000,” Bresci says. “With this new approach, we can change the components commonly used in Raman-based devices, and save space, time, and cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward a wearable sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clinical study performed at the MIT Center for Clinical Translation Research (CCTR), the researchers used the new device to take readings from a healthy volunteer over a four-hour period. As the subject rested their arm on top of the device, a near-infrared beam shone through a small glass window onto the skin to perform the measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each measurement takes a little more than 30 seconds, and the researchers took a new reading every five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, the subject consumed two 75-gram glucose drinks, allowing the researchers to monitor significant changes in blood glucose concentration. They found that the Raman-based device showed accuracy levels similar to those of two commercially available, invasive glucose monitors worn by the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since finishing that study, the researchers have developed a smaller prototype, about the size of a cellphone, that they’re currently testing at the MIT CCTR as a wearable monitor in healthy and prediabetic volunteers. Next year, they plan to run a larger study working with a local hospital, which will include people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also working on making the device even smaller, about the size of a watch. Additionally, they are exploring ways to ensure that the device can obtain accurate readings from people with different skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Korean Technology and Information Promotion Agency for SMEs, and Apollon Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The rise of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro has been nothing short of meteoric. Originally developed to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs are now widely used for weight loss and have become household names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alongside headlines of dramatic transformations are reports of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and unwanted pregnancies after contraception failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the risks? And what should you do if you are taking these medicines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-babies-heres-why-oral-contraceptives-might-be-failing"&gt;'Ozempic Babies': Here's Why Oral Contraceptives Might Be Failing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these drugs work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs are medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. They work by reducing blood sugar levels and reducing appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five medicines in this category are approved for use in Australia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounjaro (tirzepatide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wegovy (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxenda (liraglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trulicity (dulaglutide).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs have been around for the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/artg/217965"&gt;past decade&lt;/a&gt; but rose in popularity in recent years, with the help of Hollywood celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects of GLP-1 medicines are related to &lt;a href="https://www.ozempic.com/how-to-take/side-effects.html"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, stomach pain and constipation. These tend to be mild and either go away with time or become more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more concerning side effects have prompted Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety-monitoring-and-information/safety-alerts/product-warnings-updated-glp-1-ra-class"&gt;issue new warnings this week&lt;/a&gt; about suicidal thoughts and the lower effectiveness of oral contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 12 months to November 2025, there were 20 cases of suicidal thoughts reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/adverse-events/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen"&gt;Australian Database of Adverse Events Notifications&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with the use of a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with published scientific data. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75965-2"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found a link between GLP-1 medicines and a 106% increase in the risk of suicidal behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.23385"&gt;World Health Organization data&lt;/a&gt; also found a link between semaglutide use and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg" alt="crying woman" class="wp-image-183989 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Links between suicidal thoughts and GLP-1 drugs have been found in a number of studies, though others have found the opposite effect. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEAMO031Cg/"&gt;Karola G/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the evidence supports a link between GLP-1 drugs and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the data of more than 1.8 million patients who were taking the medicines for either weight loss or diabetes. It found a lower, not higher, risk of new or recurring suicidal thoughts when compared with patients who were not taking a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can these drugs affect contraception?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral contraceptives work by using hormones to prevent the release of eggs from the ovaries and to thicken the cervical mucus. This latter effect makes it difficult for sperm to reach and fertilise an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are only triggered when pregnancy-related hormones are at a high enough level. If GLP-1 medicines affect how the body absorbs hormones in oral contraceptives, hormone levels may not reach concentrations high enough to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers first raised the potential for GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability of GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives may vary between drugs. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that examined the link between tirzepatide and oral contraception found that this specific drug had a higher impact on hormone absorption when compared with other GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg" alt="pills" class="wp-image-183991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some GLP-1 drugs may impact the absorption of hormones in oral contraceptive drugs. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEVhT8CjDo/"&gt;Olga Niekrasova/The Olga Niekrasova Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of semaglutide published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.443"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; found the drug did not affect the amount of hormone that was absorbed into the body when patients were given the commonly used oral contraceptive pills ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a more recent study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S506957"&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt; concluded that both tirzepatide and oral semaglutide were able to affect oral contraceptive hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs should not affect the efficacy of IUDs or other long-acting (implanted) contraceptives, as they are not reliant on hormones being absorbed from the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I'm taking one of these drugs, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TGA recommends that if you're taking GLP-1 medicines, you should tell your doctor if you experience new or worsening  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, suicidal thoughts, or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women taking the GLP-1 drug tirzepatide and oral contraceptives, the TGA advises either switching to a non-oral contraceptive (like an implant) or adding a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the GLP-1 medicine, or any time you increase the dose of tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GLP-1 drug should not be used during pregnancy, as it &lt;a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2025/223/7/incidence-glp-1-receptor-agonist-use-women-reproductive-age-attending-general"&gt;may affect fetal growth&lt;/a&gt;. The adverse events database has also reported cases of miscarriages in women who were at the time taking semaglutide or tirzepatide.

Even so, no one could have guessed that the introduction would be capable of melting everyone's heart!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These new BFFs are two peas in a pod!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sandy couldn't have been any gentler with her tiny new friend.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosf9do006t27p3flpg2qpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            George Mycock’s fitness routine had gotten out of hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5q00083b6nph3k7qxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 22-year-old was terrified of putting on body fat but eager to develop more muscle. He tracked his food so thoroughly that he was weighing lettuce leaves. And he was exercising –– way too much, in fact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00093b6npt6etozi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I halved it, I’d still probably be doing the same, if not more, than what anyone else I knew who was going to the gym,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000a3b6n1og35dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as he worked, he never felt satisfied. On the contrary, he often felt like he just didn’t have the discipline or character to reach his ever-changing body goals. He felt like a loser.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000b3b6nvtblvfxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then he found himself pulling away from his friends at university and increasingly believing people would be better off without him, he said. He was experiencing suicidal thoughts when a friend dropped by unexpectedly to check on him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000c3b6ndlhixj90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just started crying in front of her … I just told her how awful I felt,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000d3b6nnmjpfi5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That was the breakthrough moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000e3b6n3ziiq2ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the time, I didn’t really know that it was necessarily about my body or about the eating. I just knew that I felt horrendous. I just thought I was pathetic loser. And she convinced me to get help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000f3b6nwaxh6t07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock has never received a formal diagnosis for the condition –– he only knows of one person who has. But seven years later, as a researcher in the field and doctoral student at the University of Worcester in the United Kingdom, he understands his experience as muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called “bigorexia.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000g3b6nfx25d202@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle dysmorphia occurs when an individual becomes obsessed with becoming muscular,” said Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. Nagata is lead author of a review on the condition published in The Lancet Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Health Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000h3b6nqa9jul0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is often unrecognized and behaviors that go with it can even be praised, but the condition isn’t just about vanity, Mycock said. It is a mental health condition that can have serious consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000i3b6nomvek5ew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This type of dysmorphia can include extreme exercise behaviors, concern about being “scrawny” even if a person is objectively muscular, and the use of performance- or appearance-enhancing drugs, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000j3b6nzdd5olmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is considered part of a family of eating and body image disorders that are often stereotyped as being restricted to thin, White, young women. But they can happen to anyone – and sometimes they go unnoticed because they can resemble behaviors society praises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000k3b6nkdj13zup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In moderation, exercise is healthy, and the goal is to find activities that feel enjoyable and sustainable over the long term,” Nagata said. “But with muscle dysmorphia, workouts can shift from something positive to something that causes more stress than joy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000l3b6nvcqcmm47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people, especially young men, find joy and community at the gym when they go to get fit, but some people can take it too far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000m3b6no00oo1pz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead of looking forward to a workout, people with muscle dysmorphia may feel compelled to go because they worry about missing a session. Building muscle may start to get in the way of work, school or their relationships, Nagata said. People with this condition also may withdraw from social events or their usual activities because of concerns over their appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000n3b6n3hnic70e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When exercise starts to take over your life rather than support it, that’s a warning sign,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000o3b6nnzx7jdmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dominance of exercise over a person’s life is not without consequence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000p3b6nphqqwif3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is linked with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, substance use, and sometimes suicide risk, Nagata said. And the performance-enhancing drugs –– like anabolic steroids –– can have health consequences on the brain, such as irritability, aggression and paranoia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000q3b6nht32tgds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overexercise can lead to muscle or joint injuries, as well, he said. Steroid use can also damage the kidneys and liver and increase heart disease risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000r3b6ny6nowulp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is hard to tell when a desire to be muscular tips over into a disorder, because many people get the cultural message that appearance is important for social status and dating opportunities, said Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000s3b6nsitbxb6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a lot of young people, they think that their body needs to look a particular way in order to succeed,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000t3b6nxj4qq219@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boys and young men in particular are at risk for muscle dysmorphia because of the specific societal pressures put on their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000u3b6n823pglfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most boys and then have generally higher drive for muscularity overall, like they want to go to the gym. They want to be more muscular based on sort of the ideal male body,” Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000v3b6na33gz1s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weightlifting and body building increase the risk, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000w3b6nayach3sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Competitive athletes are especially vulnerable, and the risk is even higher when training is focused on changing appearance rather than improving performance,” he said. “Those pressures around physique can make certain athletes more susceptible to developing unhealthy or obsessive relationships with their bodies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000x3b6nm5aytseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock’s problem with fitness began when he injured his spine playing rugby at 13 and had to miss a year of school to recover. When he returned, he noticed his peers weren’t treating him the same. People who would talk with him when he was in a smaller, more muscular body suddenly were not speaking with him as much, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000y3b6nqwnfe0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when he started trying to lose weight, he found that he got more praise, to the point where his back surgeon joked about him coming in to teach other patients how to do it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000z3b6ncz19sznt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But little did he know that I was, at that point, basically starving myself and exercising multiple times a day,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00103b6n632nwdeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only was Mycock’s relationship with his body tied up with his identity as an athlete, but ideas of masculinity were at play, too, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00113b6nkdtpsikt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fitness influencers he followed online spread the message that anyone could achieve the ideal masculine body if only they worked hard enough, were disciplined enough and were man enough, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00123b6ngkn7kkoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the stricter Mycock got with his diet and exercise, the farther the goalpost moved.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00133b6nyr7xszd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every time I managed to meet the thing that I was aiming at, my brain said, ‘OK, this is now a thing that I can do, therefore it’s not good enough, and I need to do more,’” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00143b6ndkcllpvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It makes sense, because social media use is associated with muscle dissatisfaction and steroid use, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00153b6na3yml769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Boys’ bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts,” he added in an email. “Boys scroll through an endless feed of hyper-muscular, ultra-lean physiques, often heavily filtered or selected from hundreds of shots, which creates a constant pressure to measure up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00163b6np1ethllp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Mycock couldn’t reach the always far-off destination of the ultimate, masculine body, the message he received was that he just wasn’t good enough as a person, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00173b6nzt8v02yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a lot that researchers don’t know about muscle dysmorphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00183b6n9ncj9z21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data on the prevalence is limited, but two studies in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33722325/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%203%2C618%20Australian%20adolescents%20found,to%20report:%20*%20Severe%20preoccupation%20with%20muscularity" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11916914/" target="_blank"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; estimate that 2% to 3% of boys meet the criteria for muscle dysmorphia, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00193b6ntago5bjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One problem getting more information on the disorder is that people who have muscle dysmorphia likely have the gym and muscle building embedded in so much of their lives, that they are less likely to disrupt their world by seeking help, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001a3b6n7gbzregy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also difficult to determine the best treatment, because the condition resembles body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorder behaviors. Dietary practices and bulking and cutting, for example, can veer into disordered eating, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001b3b6nmicjqk1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; would likely be the first line of defense, he said. But, family-based treatment like those used for adolescents with eating disorders might provide benefit as well, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001c3b6nnr6d0mzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, with the potential for physical and mental health consequences, people concerned that they may be experiencing muscle dysmorphia should seek professional help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001d3b6n0hf0yxyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A therapist or health care provider may be a good place to start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001e3b6n5cya7av1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, the support comes from an interdisciplinary team including mental health, medical and nutrition providers, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001f3b6net42mr23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery from this condition isn’t linear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001g3b6n44agtvyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, Mycock can eat and exercise in a way that feels healthy and balanced, but body image is still something that takes some thought, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001h3b6nqm69mt7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are still times that he feels insecure, but his work with a counselor has helped him to not make his feelings about his body the foundation of his whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001i3b6np0cagj9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Previously, my life was built on a pillar, and the base of that pillar was the way that my body looked and the way people saw my body, and then everything else, like who I was, was built on top of that,” he said. “So, whenever something happened to that … my whole life fell apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001j3b6nkuuzrnpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His counselor has helped him change his perspective so that his body is one brick on the pyramid of his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001k3b6nrvazfs04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I now also have that I like that I’m funny and I’m a good friend and I’m a good partner,” Mycock said, “On those days when my body isn’t what I want it to be, or I feel insecure about it, it doesn’t matter, because I’ve got all these other things that I like about myself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An Astonishing Graph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/child-mortality-graph.jpg" srcset="/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/child-mortality-graph.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/child-mortality-graph.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 500px, 1200px" loading="lazy" border="0" alt="a graph of child mortality that shows rates of 50% until around 1800 and then a steep drop to 4% in 2020"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of human history, around 50% of children used to die before they reached the end of puberty. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality"&gt;that number is 4.3%&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 0.3% in countries like Japan &amp;amp; Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dramatic decline has resulted from better nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, vaccinations, medicines, and reductions in poverty, conflicts, and famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before ~1800, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/parents-losing-their-child"&gt;almost every parent lost a child&lt;/a&gt;; now it’s such an uncommon experience that people have forgotten and want to ban vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

People who regularly danced, made music, created visual art, or played strategy-based video games showed brain patterns associated with delayed aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect strengthened with years of experience, suggesting long-term creative engagement reshapes how the brain ages. Even short-term creative training produced measurable improvements in brain aging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Younger Brain Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Creative engagement was associated with a lower brain-age gap, a marker of delayed neural aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term dancers, musicians, artists, and strategy gamers showed the strongest brain-health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plasticity Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Creative activity increased efficiency in brain networks critical for attention, coordination, and problem-solving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SWPS University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to keep your brain in good shape? It is a good idea to regularly engage in creative activities, such as dancing, painting, or even playing certain computer games. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such activities are associated with delayed brain ageing, and the greater the experience, the stronger this association, scientists, including researchers from SWPS University, observed in an international study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The conclusions from the study, published in the journal&lt;em&gt; Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, could translate into specific actions in the field of public health. They suggest the need to incorporate creative activities (e.g., artistic, musical) into educational programs and healthcare systems as a promising tool for supporting brain health and societal well-being”, says Aneta Brzezicka, PhD, a professor at SWPS University, psychologist, and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity manifests not only in art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity, or the ability to produce novel ideas or solutions using one’s imagination, most often refers to music and art, but it turns out that playing certain video games can also stimulate it. For example, strategy games like StarCraft II require users to be resourceful in developing unique tactics, adaptive problem-solving, and personalised playstyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been known for some time that creativity and creative activities have a positive impact on brain health. However, available scientific research on this topic focuses on the effects of creative experiences on cognitive processes and well-being, which is why, as part of an international study, scientists decided to provide evidence of the impact of creative activities on brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain clocks and age gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, the researchers analysed neuroimaging data and surveys from over 1,400 participants from 13 countries (including Turkey, Italy, Cuba, Argentina, Canada, Germany, and Poland), among them individuals who could be described as experts in a given creative field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancers (tango), musicians, visual artists, and action game players, including inexperienced players, were included. In one of the studies, participants’ brain activity was measured before and after several weeks of training in StarCraft II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used advanced computational models, so-called brain clocks, which attempt to estimate a person’s “brain age” based on neuroimaging data. They are used in scientific research on a variety of brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models compare predicted brain age with chronological age, estimating the so-called brain-age gap (BAG), which reflects accelerated or delayed brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accelerated ageing (and therefore larger positive BAGs) is observed in psychiatric and neurological conditions, but also in people exposed to certain physical and social factors and leading unhealthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity supports brain health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors found that people more engaged in creative activities, from dance and music to visual arts and playing computer games, tended to have a younger “brain age”, suggesting that such activities may help delay brain ageing and support healthy brain function. The link between creativity and brain health was independent of the type of creative activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the analysed activities are associated with stimulating imagination and generating new solutions. Although they differ in form, they work in a similar way and may help maintain neural connections that are most vulnerable to weakening with age. The study shows that these activities support key functions, including motor control, coordination, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creative experiences increased the plasticity of brain regions susceptible to ageing, as well as areas associated with creative processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study shows that creative experiences are associated with higher local and global brain network efficiency (especially in the frontoparietal hubs), which translates into more efficient information processing in those key regions,” explains psychologist Natalia Kowalczyk-Grębska, PhD, whose doctoral dissertation defended at SWPS University contributed to the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater experience, younger brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have spent years developing their skills in creative fields such as dance, music, art, or playing real-time strategy games had, on average, a more “youthful” brain-age profile compared to those with less experience in these activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that long-term practice related to creativity may be more effective in promoting neural plasticity and brain health than short-term experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although regular creative activity has been shown to help maintain a “younger” brain, in this study, even several weeks of targeted training (around 30 hours in total) were linked to measurable changes in brain-age indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of delayed brain ageing were observed across all creative domains studied, especially among more experienced individuals, with similar but smaller effects in participants undergoing short-term training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that it is a good idea to regularly tap into our creative potential, be it through dancing, painting, or immersing ourselves in the world of computer games. Such activities are associated with slower brain ageing, making them one of the simple, everyday ways to support brain health and – indirectly – our well-being, Brzezicka concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper describing the study, “Creative experiences and brain clocks” was published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following researchers were involved in the study: Aneta Brzezicka, PhD, a professor at SWPS University and psychologist from the Institute of Psychology at SWPS University; Natalia Kowalczyk-Grębska, PhD, a psychologist who defended her doctorate at SWPS University; and Natalia Jakubowska, PhD, a psychologist from the Faculty of Psychology at SWPS University in Warsaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764715040898"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does creativity really affect how fast the brain ages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes — higher creative engagement was linked to measurably younger-looking brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764715043407"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Do video games provide the same benefits as traditional art forms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes — strategy-based games showed similar brain-protective effects as music, dance, and visual art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764715042831"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How quickly can creative activities affect the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Brain-age changes were detected after just several weeks of targeted creative training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this creativity and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e68b8287888991958d87cb8d8f958f838aa695919695c8838293c8968a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marta Danowska-Kisiel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://swps.edu.pl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SWPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marta Danowska-Kisiel – SWPS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64173-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Creative experiences and brain clocks&lt;/a&gt;” by Aneta Brzezicka et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative experiences and brain clocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creative experiences may enhance brain health, yet metrics and mechanisms remain elusive. We characterized brain health using brain clocks, which capture deviations from chronological age (i.e., accelerated or delayed brain aging).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We combined M/EEG functional connectivity (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,240) with machine learning support vector machines, whole-brain modeling, and &lt;em&gt;Neurosynth&lt;/em&gt; metanalyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this framework, we reanalyzed previously published datasets of expert and matched non-expert participants in dance, music, visual arts, and video games, along with a pre/post-learning study (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 232).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found delayed brain age across all domains and scalable effects (expertise&amp;gt;learning). The higher the level of expertise and performance, the greater the delay in brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-vulnerable brain hubs showed increased connectivity linked to creativity, particularly in areas related to expertise and creative experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurosynth&lt;/em&gt; analysis and computational modeling revealed plasticity-driven increases in brain efficiency and biophysical coupling, in creativity-specific delayed brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate a domain‑independent link between creativity and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 22:59:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE1SRFUtb21xdlJFUDFsNTA5UFVUN2FNLXZLa2pZT2t3bVh3NGFaSURQTlhsYjJCMlhxOTZuTUtBRndITVJuc244Rm9rMXRkVEp2eU5lM1JkSFJSN2JnVWc0WUhHUTBpQjgzbUE</guid></item><item><title>考古研究挑战古饮食，揭示人类长期食用“加工植物食品” - Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-12-archaeological-paleo-diet-revealing-humans.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

In a word—yikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But let’s rewind for just a sec.

(The study included 108 participants, both men and women, between the ages of 25 and 75.) What they found was that the molecules didn’t shift in numbers in a linear fashion over time, but in bursts around the ages of 44 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s,” &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; study senior author Michael Snyder, PhD, professor of genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine. “And that’s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Initially, researchers assumed that the mid-40s shift they noticed was due to the changes women in the test group were undergoing during &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause or menopause" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause or menopause&lt;/a&gt;. But when they isolated just the men, the same shift was still evident, leading them to theorize that there are other underlying drivers of aging for both men and women that have nothing to do with perimenopause or menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Further research will be needed to identify a lot of these whys—in addition to further validating the results. Given the study’s small participant pool and limited timespan (participants were followed for a median period of 1.7 years), a bigger, longer-term study will be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But the initial results were undeniably compelling.

That nightly glass of Chardonnay. “As we age, we don't metabolize alcohol as easily, and it impairs our sleep quality,” says Keri Peterson, MD, an internal medicine physician, who begins discussing alcohol consumption more aggressively with patients in their 40s. “The metabolite of alcohol is a stimulant, so it wakes us up, often around 3 a.m.” (It’s worth noting that the Stanford study also found shifts in alcohol metabolism around ages 40 and 60.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If possible, Dr. Peterson recommends cutting alcohol out entirely. “Even with one glass, you're going to have disrupted sleep,” she says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="establish-a-strength-training-routine-if-you-havent-already" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;3. Establish a strength-training routine (if you haven’t already).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Women start losing muscle mass as early as their 30s. In fact, we lose about &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="3 to 5 percent per decade" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="22.1.0"&gt;3 to 5 percent per decade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But you can preserve the muscle mass you have—or even build more!—by lifting, even just a few days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It doesn't have to be five days a week like a bodybuilder in a gym,” says Kristen McParland, a NASM-certified personal trainer. “There's tons of research that shows just two days a week of full-body strength training can give you a laundry list of positive side effects to your immune system, your muscle mass, your bone density, your mood, your sleep, and your heart health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Of course, you can’t lift the same 3-lb. dumbbell week after week in the hopes of seeing gains. “In order to see change in a muscular bone joint, you need to challenge the muscle,” McParland says. You can do this by incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="progressive overload" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your routine, which essentially means upping the weight and/or reps every few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The Bottom line, says McParland: “If a client is in [the gym strength training] twice a week, they're lifting from 30 to 60 minutes full-body, and they're intentionally challenging their muscle groups—that's the most important part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-your-muscles-with-protein" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;4.

While it’s a bit of a generalization, there’s certainly a nugget of truth to it, says McParland. “It doesn't matter how hard you work in the gym if you don't have an adequate protein and carbohydrate intake to help build the muscle.” While the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, McParland recommends aiming for .8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight to support muscle-building goals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-forget-the-cardio" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;5.

That could take the form of incline walking, biking, hiking, or a light jog (emphasis on the light, McParland adds). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="protect-your-skin-with-spf" data-node-id="35" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;6.

This causes numerous side effects, including hot flashes, weight gain, sleep disturbances and more. You may be able to stave off some of these symptoms—and prevent some age-related conditions—by taking a hormone replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“I do recommend women discuss the pros and cons, whether they're a candidate, and whether they think it's for them with their doctor,” says Dr. Peterson. “If you're doing estrogen and progesterone without testosterone, it's going to help hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis prevention, and just overall sense of wellbeing. If you also do it with testosterone, that will help support muscle building and libido.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="implement-practices-that-help-keep-your-brain-stimulated-and-sharp" data-node-id="46" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;2.

Predominantly, it seems to be a genetic condition, with studies showing that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4996332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;60–90%&lt;/a&gt; of the risk is heritable. Having a close relative with autism is a significant risk factor for developing ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many genes are involved in ASD risk. To date, more than &lt;a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/gene-scoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;900 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been implicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; play a part. These include being born to older parents, gestational diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy, and poor maternal mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have shown, however, that vaccines of any kind are not related to autism risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While animal research is a vital part of the scientific method, mouse models of ASD are fraught with challenges. Not least because many experts &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;believe that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; “ASD is a uniquely human disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When interpreting the results of any animal study, we need to be extra skeptical. This is particularly the case when investigating neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results of this study are encouraging, rodent models of ASD — although often created by altering genes that are known to be linked to ASD — are not a true representation of ASD in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/drmariaknobel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, MBBS, Medical Director at MedicalCert, who was not involved in the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Animal models provide a certain indication of the circuits and patterns of inflammation,” she explained, “but they cannot reflect human sensory or emotional life.

However, when given as a trio, they identified improvements in protein synthesis in the brain, synapse activity, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors write: “Dietary supplements that enhance synaptic activity and protein synthesis can correct the abnormal neural activation and connectivity and improve the social behaviors of multiple ASD mouse models.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-first author, Ming-Hui Lin, was “thrilled to observe that just 7 days of treatment with the nutrient mixture significantly modulated neuronal circuit activity and connectivity in real time. These results provide strong support for the beneficial effects of low-dose nutrient supplement combinations.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As treatments for ASD are severely lacking, there may be a temptation to experiment on oneself or their child. However, this is not without risks. Speaking with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, Knöbel told us how she had seen people develop insomnia shortly after changing their supplement regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also told us how children, because of their smaller size, can easily be given “dangerous metabolic loads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agreement, clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.davincified.com/authors/eleni-nicolaou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eleni Nicolaou&lt;/a&gt; warned &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that supplements at the wrong dose “can cause significant changes in sleep, heart rate, and the effects of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have personally seen fatigue, nausea, and mood swings as a result of taking what appeared to be safe supplements,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, this study is a fascinating addition to our understanding of ASD. It may also be the first step along the road toward a simple treatment to ease symptoms for some people. However, much more work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 20:45:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNRXlGZ0h2RzBaMHhrNTc2bkxhZWFiRVp0SzV0cGNZU3N1SEpoSThzZVpxem51bFRUaW81cTFGbC13c2trWEFiakJjVVNuaTRXTUNTbGJWNDdOTkRNbzZCeGhtZF9XcUtCYUhfa1lPbVR0YnpVSk1vUnV3ZFQ1dThCYjdGUFFydDA1TkdwVWFlaUdTcGc4VmQtRUJfRHdIbFRwVEZCZnlR</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，橙汁会影响免疫细胞中的数千个基因- Euronews.com</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/12/02/orange-juice-found-to-affect-thousands-of-genes-in-immune-cells-study-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[6aW:mE÷aîjR€:Rşüù÷ßpıÿƒÑd¶Xmv‡Óåöx}~ÿ¯šU¹’è?®qõIô5*Î”ä·%µV¦{MÏ« ] ÀÀ*±ût6/²&amp;gt;ˆl´s/¿Í.�?j}ı¾Ó•dÇrMg+‰í¬gİÎ�ä

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Giving a young kid a smartphone may be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;New research conducted by scientists from UC Berkeley and Columbia University found that children 12 years old and younger who received one of these devices were at a higher risk of depression, obesity, and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The alarming findings, published as a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072941/205716/Smartphone-Ownership-Age-of-Smartphone-Acquisition?" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, were based on an analysis of over 10,000 children who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study between 2018 and 2020, which is purportedly the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the US. And while they don’t strictly establish causation, the broad correlation they show underscores a larger and ever-growing body of research exploring the deleterious cognitive effects that devices like smartphones and tablets can have adolescents, ranging from their &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;impact on their education&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-screen-time-developmental-delays"&gt;social skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“When you give your kid a phone, you need to think of it as something that is significant for the kid’s health — and behave accordingly,” lead author Ran Barzilay, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/well/family/early-smartphone-ownership-study.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In the study, about two-thirds of the participants used a smartphone. The median age they received them at was 11 years old, and their development was compared to a cohort of roughly 3,800 children in the study who never received a smartphone before turning 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Not only did the researchers find that children who owned a smartphone by age 12 were at a greater risk of depression, obesity, and poor sleep, but they also showed that the younger a child was when they first received a smartphone, the higher those risks became for obesity and poor sleep in particular. The earlier a kid is hooked on a smartphone, in other words, the worse their physical and mental health outcomes are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Trying to identify the “right” age to give a youth a smartphone, however, may be missing the point. The researchers also found that a group of children who had never owned a smartphone before turning 12, but were then given one, showed a higher risk of poorer mental health and sleep by the time they were 13, compared to another group who stayed phoneless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We didn’t even look at what the kids did on the phone,” Barzilay &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one’s own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That is both a strength and a drawback to the study. It’s likely that it’s not just a quality inherent to the smartphones that are causing problems, but the apps they give access to, like social media sites, whose myriad risks to children are well documented. YouTube, TikTok, and streaming services like Netflix could supply an endless amount of entertainment to keep a child well up past their bedtime, too. Then there’s addictive mobile games designed to both murder your attention span and drain your wallet. At this moment, we’re also plunging headlong into a world of AI chatbots and companions, which &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/lonely-children-ai-chatbots"&gt;many children are turning to act as a close friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A lot of questions are unanswered, but these latest findings are echoed by a bevy of other research. A &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/study-younger-kids-smartphones"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 100,000 children, for example, found that those who received smartphones before the age of 13 experienced more suicidal thoughts, a lower perception of self-worth, and detachment from reality. Similarly, the study also found that every year before 13 that a child received a smartphone was associated with a greater likelihood of poorer mental health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Society is still grappling with how these devices have transformed interpersonal relationships and taken over teenage and preteen attention spans. Many schools are opting to take the safe route by &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;banning smartphones entirely&lt;/a&gt;. In follow-up research, Barzilay hopes to explore more specific features of smartphone usage to determine their link to mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It’s critical for young people to have time away from their phones to engage in physical activity, which can protect against obesity and enhance mental health over time,” Barzilay said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-in-childhood-to-increased-risk-of-depression-and-obesity-in-youth-302627044.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on mental health:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/kids-test-scores-lowest-decades"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an Interesting Theory About Why Kids’ Test Results Have Fallen to Their Lowest Point in Two Decades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(WLOS)  — &lt;/span&gt;Destroyed by the floodwaters of Helene on Sept. 27, 2024, Village Wayside Bar &amp;amp; Grille in Biltmore Village has been closed since and its future seemed in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Dec. 1, over a year after Helene, owners Mark and Polly Harding made an announcement all of their loyal customers have been waiting to hear - they will be reopening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hardings decided to sell the old property, located adjacent to Biltmore's historic train depot, and announced on Dec. 1 that they will be reopening at yet another historic location in Asheville: Grovewood Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/biltmore-village-rebuilds-community-helne-damage-repairs-white-lotus-boutique-gofundme-north-carolina-small-business-infrastructure-grant-program-resiliency-improvements-restoration-sidewalks-flood-resilience-pedestrian-safety-stromwater-management" target="_blank"&gt;BILTMORE VILLAGE REBUILDS WITH COMMUNITY HELP, GRANTS FOR HELENE DAMAGE REPAIRS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the news release, construction is now under way on the new Village Wayside, which will be in North Asheville's historic Grove Park neighborhood at Grovewood Village.  They are anticipating to be open by the winter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spot, formerly the ELDR Restaurant, also has ties to Biltmore, the release said. It was the site of Biltmore Industries — originally founded in Biltmore Village with support from Edith Vanderbilt — and was purchased in 1917 by Fred Loring Seely, son-in-law of Edwin Grove and the visionary behind the Grove Park Inn, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Wayside owner Mark Harding said he and his wife are looking forward to starting business back up in the restaurant's new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/hurricane-helene-journey-hope-return-biltmore-village-recovery-over-11-months-nearly-one-year-post-storm-tourism-visitors-locals-business-owners-association" target="_blank"&gt;HELENE: A JOURNEY OF HOPE (RETURN TO BILTMORE VILLAGE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we will forever cherish the memories of our time in Biltmore Village in the iconic old train depot, we are excited to embrace this new chapter as a chance to rebuild, grow, and connect with the community,” he said in the release. “We can’t wait to welcome back our loyal patrons of many years and introduce the Wayside to the North Asheville community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hardings operated Village Wayside in Biltmore Village for 15 years at the historic spot next to the depot, which itself represents a pivotal chapter in Asheville’s development. According to the release, when George Vanderbilt visited the region in 1888, he envisioned both a grand estate and a surrounding village. To bring this vision to life, he hired architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Their combined efforts shaped not only the Biltmore Estate but also the community that became Biltmore Village. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The train depot opened in 1896 and remained a transportation hub until 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:02:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wJBVV95cUxNV0xTMmlyTy13VlNLZXc2RTZReTc5c2FHaDlBcnZqd0xRNXVldU9DQ0tOY3ZoRDltWF91T3I5cG9Dc0FrbVctcEE1NXY1ZVNEYjkxV2p3Qk0xZ0V5eTBoeHk5bEpJbnRITmNMMnhIckxOay04TTRYRDNkVmR6ZTh3YVBNTU54azJMWndVVnliZEVMMEk0aHUwc2pPNnczV1JSTzlGckRIYVlnVTBrNmVWa0t3NVJPVGdhNlZob041M2dnWi1hU2RTemxhdmhxTVBnYlBMa3cxZWJ1MlRKVG0tVmRLX1J4ZzQ0Tk1QVnpHdDM2VlMtNlFoaThtdWRnOWViOXlrdW9VUElpTHdnaEpPYWtqemFsaWE3bW5ZSDVqRlUySFZVcU9Cd3JLN0RDS3RjalpsRWROZ3pEa0hfX2VmWjVOVkRRdmQ1OW9TXzVkb081bm9aRkRN</guid></item></channel></rss>
