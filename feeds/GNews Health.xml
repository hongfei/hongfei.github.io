            Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by a parasite carried by insects called kissing bugs, should now be considered endemic in the United States, experts say – and without recognition that it’s a constant presence in some parts of the country, more people will suffer unnecessarily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60002336nkea8aeh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; on the topic was published last week in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the authors say they hope that growing global attention on the new paper means Chagas could finally get the surveillance, prevention and testing efforts and research funding it deserves in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60004336nqxxclofm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting forever; all of us Chagas people have been waiting for people to recognize this disease is in our communities,” said Dr. Norman Beatty, coauthor of the report and &lt;a href="https://id.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/beatty-norman/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Florida College of Medicine’s Division of Infectious Diseases &amp;amp; Global Medicine who has studied Chagas for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60005336n240rslsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers Chagas a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;neglected tropical disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;the Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says it is endemic – with a constant presence or usual prevalence – in 21 other countries in the Americas, not including the United States. Chagas is one of the leading causes of heart disease in Latin America, and it causes more disability than other insect-borne infections, even more than malaria and Zika, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-019-0170-1#ref-CR1" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60006336nucdkiiww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas largely spreads when triatomine bugs, commonly known as kissing bugs, bite a human while they’re sleeping. The bug defecates in that bite or on a person’s face, and the person unwittingly wipes the feces into their eyes, nose or mouth. The feces can carry a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflo942g00053b6qyfuto9p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;can also spread&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated food or blood, organ transplants and pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60007336nnwrt5n09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms can include fever, body aches, headaches, rash, vomiting and tiredness. They may last weeks or even months after initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000a336n46075m90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, about 20% to 30% of people who’ve been infected develop more serious problems like long-term digestive and nervous system conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599#:~:text=Background:,suspected%20or%20confirmed%20Chagas%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60008336n3bzcz2jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s caught early, the disease can be cured with benznidazole or nifurtimox, medicines that kill the parasite. But the drugs become less effective the longer a person has been infected, and most people remain unaware of the disease. Many doctors don’t think to look for it in patients in the US, the new report noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflobcrr000a3b6qldijporx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, some people who are infected find out some time later, when they donate blood, since the US has been testing its blood supply for Chagas since 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000b336n9zq95kqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Surveillance is limited, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 280,000 people in the US have Chagas at any given time. It’s unclear how many have the more serious form of the disease or how many deaths are caused by Chagas each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000c336n8tl8gjl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have found kissing bugs in 32 states, the new report says. The blood-sucking insect mostly lives in warmer Southern states, but with climate change causing more bug-friendly temperatures, there’s a good chance they have spread farther.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000d336n8wqdxrky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientistst have identified at least 17 states with infected mammals, including Virginia opossums, raccoons, banded armadillos, striped skunks, coyotes and wood rats, according to the latest report. Veterinarians have seen infections in zoo animals and pets, including cats, dogs and a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Doctors have reported Chagas cases in humans in eight states: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. There are probably more cases, the new report says, but doctors are not required to report Chagas infections in most states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsotx0000336nf9fpwfl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It would be “momentous” for Chagas to be declared endemic in the US, said Dr. Mario J. Grijalva, director of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ohio University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflskphj000q3b6qkmgkpfnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you consider it a problem that belongs to others, it’s not important. But when it’s a problem affecting people here, the recognition that it is an endemic disease in the United States is a game-changer, at least in terms of the public policy possibilities and the awareness that is required to properly address this complicated issue,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfls921l001i336nhzfm5nrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grijalva knows firsthand what a difference it can make to have awareness and a concerted health campaign. He spent his recent sabbatical riding a motorcycle across Latin America to spread the word about the condition, after making a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwYpF14vNs" target="_blank"&gt;similar motorcycle trip in the US&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsmh5k000s3b6qdo9se4is@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In countries like Ecuador and Peru where Chagas is endemic but there is no concerted government efforts to manage it, most people were unaware of the disease, Grijalva said. But in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina - all countries with robust health and public awareness campaigns – the people he spoke with knew about Chagas, and many cases were being well-managed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsoet4000x3b6q7rwyeqhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of effort to fight this in those countries,” Grijalva said. “It can be fought, and there are a lot of successes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Beatty hopes broader recognition of Chagas in the US will prompt officials to step up surveillance efforts like what he’s seen in some other countries. He also hopes health care providers learn to recognize cases sooner and wishes the US would work to protect people from kissing bugs like it does mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000g336njp70r42p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have mosquito control programs around the country, but we’re essentially doing nothing about kissing bugs,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000h336ng94jpj19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, he said, people aiming to keep the insects away can better seal their homes, use window screens and spray for bugs. However, he has not found any particular spray specifically approved to target kissing bugs in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000i336nrqasd7bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And in Florida, where he works and where about 30% of kissing bugs seem to be positive for the parasites, Beatty said, people will often send him bug photos or even drop the insects off at his hospital to be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000j336nx5zhim7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re scared,” he said – and they have a right to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000k336np8egbvwy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty said he tries to help his community as best he can. “There’s not another doctor around here walking around with bugs in their pockets,” he said. But with more awareness, he hopes others will step up as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000l336nux2vmww4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m just one person,” Beatty said. “It’s a small team, and we have limited resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying, until age 4, the hepatitis B vaccine that's currently given to newborns, according to two former senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life," said Demetre Daskalakis, the former director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "Apparently this is a priority of the Secretary's."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vote is expected to take place Thursday during the next meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ" target="_blank"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for September 18-19 at a CDC office in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, the CDC has advised that infants get the first of three shots of the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/VaccChildren.htm" target="_blank"&gt;at birth&lt;/a&gt;. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Between 1990 and 2022, case rates plummeted 99 percent among people age 19 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians warn that waiting until age 4 to begin vaccination opens the door to more children contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Age four makes zero sense," said pediatrician &lt;a href="https://aapca1.org/profile/eric-ball-md-district-ix-vice-chair/" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Ball&lt;/a&gt;, who practices in Orange County, California. "We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It's really the best way to keep our entire population healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;will also discuss&lt;/a&gt; and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine, and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, because ACIP's recommendations generally determine whether insurance plans and federal programs pay for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is an atypical situation. There's been no work group to discuss it," Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second former official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an email, a Health and Human Services spokesman, Andrew Nixon, wrote, "ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public Sunday, only a few days before the meetings are scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting in June, chairman Martin Kulldorff, one of the new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88955" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;public health measures&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use," Kulldorff said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The infection requires direct exposure to infected bodily fluids like blood and semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Protection From Birth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=transaction#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20acute%20disease,HBV%20infection%20must%20be%20expanded." target="_blank"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/stories/hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccination-in-africa.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20Mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission%20is%20the,hours%20of%20life%2C%20can%20prevent%20mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission." target="_blank"&gt;24 hours of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While parents may opt out of the shots, many daycare centers and school districts &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/laws/hepb-ccsch-rqt-map-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;require proof&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The prospect of altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am goddamn frustrated," said &lt;a href="https://wendylo.com/#about" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Lo&lt;/a&gt;, 52, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. Lo says she has probably had hepatitis B since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has impacted almost every aspect of her life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented," she said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo only learned she had the disease due to a routine screening in order to study abroad in college as a young adult. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo credits the vaccines with protecting all the members of her close family from infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I shared with my partner, 'if you get vaccinated, we can be together,'" she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, "so I'm grateful for that," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=Although%20HBV%20can%20be%20found,breastfeeding%2C%20or%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;do not know&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;few or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S. Asians and Pacific Islanders, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.6.htm" target="_blank"&gt;followed by&lt;/a&gt; Black people, have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the lifetime consequences, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/perinatal-hepb/downloads/HepB-Provider-tipsheet-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren't available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Now I'm in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it's life-saving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Thirty Years of Universal Vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on so-called "high-risk" adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the healthcare practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we've learned so much more," said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/person/william-schaffner-md/" target="_blank"&gt;former voting member &lt;/a&gt;of ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime – newborns. The virus is often&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pop-who-is-at-risk" target="_blank"&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We may soon hear 'let's just do a blood test on all pregnant women.' We tried that. That doesn't work perfectly either," Shaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some doctors didn't test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative, while others acquired hepatitis B later in pregnancy, after they had already been tested. In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison member to the ACIP group that voted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommend universal vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We want no babies infected. Therefore, we'll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 in those 19 years old and under in the U.S., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injected drug use or multiple sexual partners, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/hepatitis-b-vaccine#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20catch%20hepatitis,through%20air%2C%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; caution that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations, especially among young children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus can survive for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm#:~:text=Introduction,is%20provided%20(Box%201)." target="_blank"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a &lt;a href="https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school desk or playground equipment&lt;/a&gt; can pose a risk. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children who are not considered "high risk" can still be exposed in everyday environments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Future Access Uncertain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shot if given before the new recommended age. That could leave parents to pay out of pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Children who get immunizations through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner is still a liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He intends to speak up if he can, because he's worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We'll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We'll see transmission into the next generation," he said.

&lt;p&gt;As World Suicide Prevention Day was observed on September 10, TT finds itself facing a stark reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory Data Repository, this country ranks fifth in the Caribbean for suicide mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this troubling backdrop, president of the TT Association of Psychologists (TTAP), Kelly Mc Farlane, is sounding the alarm, especially for workers recently affected by sweeping job cuts in programmes like Cepep, the reforestation programme, and URP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, she warns, are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges stemming from financial insecurity, identity disruption, and daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane outlined several evidence-based strategies proven to help individuals cope with sudden unemployment and its psychological toll. She emphasised the importance of regulating the nervous system and maintaining a sense of control, starting with the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most effective tools is slow, diaphragmatic breathing, done two to three times a day,” she said. “It’s been shown to reduce cortisol levels and lower blood pressure, both of which spike under chronic stress. It trains the body to respond differently to stress over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem with breathing techniques, Mc Farlane recommends grounding practices and maintaining structured daily routines. Even without formal employment, she noted, people can benefit from creating consistency around meals, exercise, reading, job searches, or caring for family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This structure helps support your circadian rhythm, which plays a critical role in regulating mood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another essential technique Mc Farlane highlighted is behavioural activation, which focuses on intentionally scheduling small, purposeful tasks to help re-engage with life after a setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing a job certainly qualifies as a major life disruption. Even minor activities, like cleaning a room or applying for one job, can provide a sense of purpose and help guard against depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most powerful buffer against emotional decline, she said, is human connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social support is absolutely essential. We are wired to connect. Everyone needs at least one trusted person they can talk to, whether it’s a friend, a relative, or a peer. Just having someone to speak with regularly helps buffer the stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mc Farlane, these connections do more than offer comfort. They reduce biological markers associated with depression. She says it is not just psychological: it’s physiological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Isolation worsens things, while connection heals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also encouraged the use of cognitive reframing, a psychological technique that helps people view distressing situations through a more constructive lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive reframing isn’t about pretending things are fine,” she explained. “It’s about acknowledging the reality but choosing a perspective that doesn’t add to your distress. That’s a powerful mental shift. You’re actively changing how your brain processes the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane said many affected workers live in the same communities and could benefit from peer support groups—informal spaces for shared listening, encouragement, and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These can be very effective. They don’t have to be formal or expensive. It could be a group that meets in someone’s home, at a community centre, or on Zoom. What matters is creating a safe space to talk and be heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She urged anyone feeling overwhelmed not to suffer in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms can vary, but they often include persistent sadness, withdrawal from activities, and changes in sleep or appetite. If you’re experiencing these, especially as a parent trying to hold it all together, please reach out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising many may now face financial strain, McFarlane highlighted several free resources available for those in need of help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who to turn to if you need of help:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep may enhance the brain’s ability to remove harmful waste. Poor or disrupted sleep could raise dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain possesses its own system for removing waste, known as the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00031.2020"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which is believed to become more active during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sleep is disrupted, this cleaning process may be impaired, slowing the removal of toxins and other waste products from the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb8739"&gt;Researchers suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the accumulation of such toxins due to inadequate sleep could contribute to a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains about how exactly the glymphatic system functions in humans, as much of the current evidence comes from mouse studies. Still, these findings raise the possibility that better sleep could enhance the clearance of harmful substances in the brain and thereby lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what researchers currently understand about this developing field of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why waste matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells in the body generate waste. Outside the brain, the lymphatic system removes this material by carrying it from the spaces between cells into the bloodstream through a network of vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain, however, lacks its own lymphatic vessels. Until about 12 years ago, scientists did not know how the brain handled its waste. That changed with the discovery of the glymphatic system, which was described as a mechanism that “&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/46/18190"&gt;flushes out&lt;/a&gt;” toxins from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cerebrospinal-fluid"&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds both the brain and spinal cord, plays a central role in this process. The fluid flows around blood vessels in the brain, then moves into the spaces between brain cells, where it collects waste before draining out through large veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice later demonstrated that the glymphatic system becomes most active &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1241224"&gt;during sleep&lt;/a&gt;, with waste removal markedly increased at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the substances cleared through this system is amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. When Aβ builds up in the brain, it can form plaques. Alongside tangles of another protein, tau, found in neurons, these plaques are key features of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-difference-between-alzheimers-and-dementia-225271"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans and mice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1180962"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that levels of Aβ detected in the cerebrospinal fluid increase when awake and then rapidly fall during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01638-y"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; (in mice) showed pretty much the opposite – suggesting the glymphatic system is more active in the daytime. Researchers are debating what might explain the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we still have some way to go before we can say exactly how the glymphatic system works – in mice or humans – to clear the brain of toxins that might otherwise increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Does this happen in humans too?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know sleeping well is good for us, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.55"&gt;particularly our brain health&lt;/a&gt;. We are all aware of the short-term effects of sleep deprivation on our brain’s ability to function, and we know &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00054.2024"&gt;sleep helps improve memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, a single night of complete sleep deprivation in healthy adults &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1721694115"&gt;increased the amount&lt;/a&gt; of Aβ in the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. This suggests sleep can influence the clearance of Aβ from the human brain, supporting the idea that the human glymphatic system is more active while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also raises the question of whether good sleep might lead to better clearance of toxins such as Aβ from the brain, and so be a potential target to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How about sleep apnea or insomnia?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is less clear is what long-term disrupted sleep, for instance if someone has a sleep disorder, means for the body’s ability to clear Aβ from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; is a common sleep disorder when someone’s breathing stops multiple times as they sleep. This can lead to chronic (long-term) sleep deprivation, and reduced oxygen in the blood. Both may be implicated in the accumulation of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has also been linked with an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13589"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. And we now know that after people are treated for sleep apnea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx011"&gt;more Aβ is cleared from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/insomnia-2"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt; is when someone has difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. When this happens in the long term, there’s also an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318814"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, we don’t know the effect of treating insomnia on toxins associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, it’s still too early to say for sure that treating a sleep disorder reduces your risk of dementia because of reduced levels of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these studies suggest enough good quality sleep is important for a healthy brain, and in particular for clearing toxins associated with dementia from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still don’t know if &lt;em&gt;treating&lt;/em&gt; a sleep disorder or improving sleep more broadly affects the brain’s ability to remove toxins, and whether this reduces the risk of dementia. It’s an area researchers, including us, are actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we’re investigating the &lt;a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/understanding-brain-cleaning-in-obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;concentration of Aβ and tau measured in blood&lt;/a&gt; across the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in people with sleep apnea, on and off treatment, to better understand how sleep apnea affects brain cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into the potential for treating insomnia with a class of drugs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44323-025-00025-5"&gt;known as orexin receptor antagonists&lt;/a&gt; to see if this affects the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06823752"&gt;clearance of Aβ from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you’re concerned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an emerging field and we don’t yet have all the answers about the link between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-dangerous-is-insomnia-how-fear-of-what-its-doing-to-your-body-can-wreck-your-sleep-212248"&gt;disrupted sleep and dementia&lt;/a&gt;, or whether better sleep can boost the glymphatic system and so prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are concerned about your sleep or cognition, please see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep-brain structures like the basal ganglia or the thalamus wield major influence on our behavior. If something goes awry, dysregulation in the deep brain may trigger neurological conditions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;like Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the clear importance of these structures, our knowledge about them remains limited by their location, making&lt;span&gt; them difficult to study and treat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers unveil a device that might offer an alternative to invasive procedures. Featuring a novel ultrasound helmet, it not only modulates deep-brain circuits without surgery, but reportedly can do so with unrivaled precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultrasound-can-probe-deep-into-the-brain-to-relieve-pain"&gt;Ultrasound Can Probe Deep Into The Brain to Relieve Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology represents a leap forward in our ability to study and influence the deep brain, says senior author Bradley Treeby, a biomedical engineer at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This advance opens up opportunities for both neuroscience research and clinical treatment. For the first time, scientists can non-invasively study causal relationships in deep-brain circuits that were previously only accessible through surgery," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and essential tremor," he &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, "offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system builds on existing methods like transcranial ultrasound stimulation and MRI-guided focused ultrasound, but it's designed to address limitations of each, such as the former's low focal precision and the latter's need for stabilizing skull screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new helmet can target areas in the brain 1,000 times smaller than conventional ultrasound devices can, and 30 times smaller than similar technologies that specifically target deeper areas of the brain, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does this using an array of 256 elements configured on the helmet's interior, which emit focused ultrasound beams at specific areas of the wearer's brain to raise or reduce neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg" alt="breakdown of ultrasound helmet" class="wp-image-174338 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A schematic of the ultrasound helmet.

Functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans showed a simultaneous surge of activity in the visual cortex, suggesting the LGN was successfully hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This real-time monitoring capability is an important feature, says first author Eleanor Martin, a physicist and engineer in UCL's Biomedical Ultrasound Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We designed the system to be compatible with simultaneous fMRI, enabling us to monitor the effects of stimulation in real time," she &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up exciting possibilities for closed-loop neuromodulation and personalised therapies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another experiment demonstrated the durability of the helmet's effects, with changes in visual cortex activity continuing for 40 minutes after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects reported no conscious perception of any visual changes during these tests, the researchers note, yet  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless revealed significant and persistent shifts in neural activity at the intended locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to precisely modulate deep-brain structures without surgery represents a paradigm shift in neuroscience, offering a safe, reversible, and repeatable method for both understanding brain function and developing targeted therapies," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smart-brain-implants-can-now-adapt-to-optimize-parkinsons-treatment"&gt;Smart Brain Implants Can Now Adapt to Optimize Parkinson's Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully explain what's happening in this process, the researchers point out, but these results already amount to a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such deft neuromodulation was previously impossible without invasive methods, and it offers new hope for patients with certain conditions, says co-author and clinical neuroscientist Ioana Grigoras from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are particularly excited about its potential clinical applications for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, where deep-brain regions are especially affected," Grigoras &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63020-1"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cyclists tend to do some pretty weird and wonderful things in the hope of improving performance. We’ll try any supplement or diet trend with even the faintest promise of improvement, we’ll tinker with and tweak our bikes until the cows come home, and we’ll try all sorts of strange tech in the hope of accessing even the most marginal of gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about shining a bunch of light through your skull and up your nose, into your brain, all in the hope of improving time trial performance? Yep, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-pbm"&gt;What is PBM?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might be able to tell from the name, photobiomodulation (or PBM) is a technique that involves shining light into the body in order to stimulate various effects. The light used is in the red to near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum – normally with wavelengths between 600 and 1,100 nm – and depending on what sort of tissue you point that light at, it can generate a range of different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point it at muscle tissue and it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/8/4/144?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;induce an increase in oxygen demand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which can ultimately lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-022-01714-y?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;improved performance in time-to-exhaustion tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Directing it at the muscles also seems to help with the repair of those muscles, due to a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajpmr/abstract/2014/12000/effects_of_low_level_laser_therapy_on_skeletal.7.aspx?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“reduction in the inflammatory process”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And it turns out that transcranial PBM – that is, firing those infrared lights through your skull and into your brain cells – can both &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/11/966?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enhance cognitive abilities in healthy brains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also has some potential when it comes to treating neurodegenerative conditions &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0278412&amp;amp;ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does it work exactly? To simplify a &lt;a href="https://soterixmedical.com/research/tpbm?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rather complex process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the absorption of infrared light within the brain cells seems to lead to increased blood flow in the brain, in addition to enhanced hemoglobin oxygenation (you might recall that hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues). These factors, in turn, lead to increased activation of the brain areas targeted by the PBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxygenation levels in the brain are also relevant if we’re talking about exercise performance. Various studies have shown that a &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00909.2014?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drop in cerebral oxygenation during high-intensity exercise is associated with exhaustion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that deoxygenation of the prefrontal cortex in particular seems to contribute to “the cessation of exercise” during controlled and self-paced efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if there’s a link between oxygenation levels in the brain and exercise performance, could it be that &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; oxygenation in the brain – via a technique like PBM – might help improve cycling performance?&lt;/p&gt;

Men are more likely to die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The paradox, revealed in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837792?resultClick=24#250506426" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of the country's latest cancer registry, tells a story at once simple and confounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Women account for just over half of all new cases, but men make up the majority of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;India appears to be an outlier. In 2022, for every 100,000 people worldwide, on average about 197 were diagnosed with cancer that year. Men fared worse, at 212, compared to 186 for women, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/global-cancer-data-by-country/page/2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;World Cancer Research Fund&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Nearly 20 million cancer cases were diagnosed globally in 2022 - about 10.3 million in men and 9.7 million in women. In the US, the estimated lifetime risk of cancer is nearly equal for men and women, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the most common cancers among women are breast, cervical, and ovarian. Breast and cervical cancers make up 40% of female cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While cervical cancer is largely linked to infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV), breast and ovarian cancers are often influenced by hormonal factors. Rising cases of these hormone-related cancers are also associated with lifestyle shifts - including later pregnancies, reduced breastfeeding, obesity, and sedentary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For men, oral, lung, and prostate cancers dominate. Tobacco drives 40% of preventable cancers, mainly oral and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So what is going on in India? Is it an earlier diagnosis for women? Are men's cancers more aggressive, or is it that habits such as smoking and chewing tobacco drag down their outcomes? Or does the answer lie in differences in access, awareness and treatment between genders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gautam Bose People wearing skeleton outfits take part in a rally encouraging others not to use tobacco products in Kolkata, India, on May 31, 2025.

Their cancers are more often tied to lifestyle - tobacco and alcohol drive lung and oral cancers, both aggressive and less responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Men are also less likely to go for preventive check-ups or seek medical help early. The result: higher mortality and poorer outcomes, even when incidence is lower than among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women's health has become a bigger focus in public health campaigns, and that's a double-edged sword. Greater awareness and screening mean more cancers are detected early. For men, the conversation rarely goes beyond tobacco and oral cancer," Ravi Mehrotra, a cancer specialist and head of the non-profit Centre for Health Innovation and Policy (CHIP) Foundation, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women, through reproductive health checks, are more likely to see a doctor at some stage. Many men, by contrast, may go their whole lives without ever seeing one," Dr Mehrotra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the real story emerges when the numbers are broken down: India's cancer burden is unevenly spread across regions, and across the types of cancer people face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Data from 43 registries show that 11 out of every 100 people in India run the risk of developing cancer at some point during their life. An estimated 1.56 million cases and 874,000 deaths are projected for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The hilly and relatively remote northeast region remains India's cancer hotspot, with Mizoram's Aizawl district recording lifetime risks twice the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Doctors say much of this is down to lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"For most cancers in the north-eastern state, I'm convinced lifestyle is the key factor. Tobacco use is rampant here - much higher than elsewhere," R Ravi Kannan, head of Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Assam, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In Barak Valley in Assam, it's mostly chewing tobacco; just 25km away in Mizoram, smoking dominates. Add to that alcohol, areca nuts, and even how meat is prepared. Food choices and preparation drive cancer risk. There's no special cancer-causing gene at play - hereditary cancers aren't more common here than in other parts of India," Dr Kannan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the pattern isn't confined to the northeast. Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir tops the charts for lung cancer in men, while southern Hyderabad city leads in breast cancer. Men in the capital, Delhi, are being diagnosed with all cancers put together at a higher rate than men in other regions, even after correcting for age differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Oral cancer is also rising: 14 population registries report increases among men and four among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images A woman sits beside Malsawm Puia, 28, who suffers from blood cancer, in Kale township on the India-Myanmar border, on April 17, 2024.

The disparities seen across Indian states mirror a global divide shaped by geography, income, and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In wealthy nations, one in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, but only one in 71 will die from it, according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In poorer countries, the picture is reversed: just one in 27 women will ever receive a diagnosis, yet as many as one in 48 will die of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women in lower Human Development Index (HDI) countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment," says Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then there are other differences. In the US, for example, native Americans face the highest cancer mortality, with kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancer deaths two to three times higher than whites; black people also have double the mortality of whites for prostate, stomach, and uterine cancers, according to American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the cancer burden is not just growing - it is becoming more complex. Registry data reflect a society in transition, where longevity, lifestyle, and environment are reshaping health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Yet amid this shifting landscape, many questions remain, underscoring the urgent need for targeted prevention, early detection, and lifestyle changes, including healthier diets and habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Follow BBC News India on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="youtube," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;YouTube,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:32:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5nZkxMcFRTdVp3aXE2OUNkV0JLMGVCV2ZZMEhzb2ZHaTZuS1J2aEp3aGxwV3JrMWt6aUZuV1ZzMnpSeHAzTkh5X2RUOVgzTmcwNWxBMGtTdS1WZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1UdjZyQXE2VGJsV2tHOFJiZXVNMnFfLWVBWWlRVGhoWjBoM2VZVXlxYWZ6bDR1VWpFalpyTWlQcmV2ejhmU0tDVUxRbEEtRk1Ia2U4eEFvM3RsMDB4N2lZ</guid></item><item><title>心理学研究人员确定了“极端主义倦怠”的渠道- PsyPost</title><link>http://www.psypost.org/psychology-researchers-identify-a-burnout-to-extremism-pipeline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Luigi Mangione was arrested for the alleged murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in December 2024, public reaction shocked observers. Far from universal condemnation, many people expressed support. This was especially true among younger people, with polls showing &lt;a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-poll-young-voters-diverge-from-majority-on-crypto-tiktok-and-ceo-assassination/"&gt;41% of young adults&lt;/a&gt; viewed the murder as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what leads the average person to justify extreme violence? &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000643"&gt;Our recently published research&lt;/a&gt;, in the special issue &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/vio/understanding-violent-extremism"&gt;“Understanding violent extremism”&lt;/a&gt; of the APA &lt;em&gt;Journal Psychology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;, locates the answer in one increasingly widespread phenomenon: workplace burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s &lt;a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; cites “corruption and greed” as a source of frustration, a sentiment that resonates widely amid growing dissatisfaction with modern work environments. &lt;a href="https://clinicalsocialwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cswhi_03_2024_02_butz_OPR_04.pdf"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that broader patterns of systemic frustration and perceived corruption are associated with burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, which took daily surveys from over 600 employees, suggests burnout may quietly fuel worrying attitudes – specifically, the potential justification of violent extremism – towards the perceived source of their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The burnout to extremism pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, employees made daily notes of their burnout symptoms, emotional states, and violent extremist attitudes. On days when employees felt more burnt out, they reported significantly more sympathy toward extremist ideas, such as justifying violence against perceived injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily grind of burnout produced negative feelings of fear, sadness, shame, and guilt. To alleviate these negative feelings – and regain a sense of purpose – some individuals appeared to find extremist ideologies more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon can be explained through the combined lens of three established psychological theories. The first is &lt;a href="https://oxfordre.com/criminology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-249"&gt;General Strain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that daily frustrations lead to violent extremism through the experience of negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315227979-4/burnout-existential-perspective-ayala-pines"&gt;existential model of burnout&lt;/a&gt;, which links burnout to a failed existential quest when meaningfulness in work disappears. Last is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000144"&gt;Significance Quest Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that when the sense of personal significance is eroded in people’s everyday lives, they might look elsewhere, including to radical beliefs, to restore meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, these ideas, particularly the existential and Significance Quest models, suggest that burnout reflects a failed search for meaning – one that may drive individuals toward violent extremism as a means of restoration. General Strain Theory further contributes by emphasising the emotional path involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why burnout matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not suggest that individuals experiencing burnout will inevitably engage in extremist violence. Rather, it demonstrates how everyday experiences of burnout can subtly shift individuals toward violent extremist attitudes, thereby normalising the acceptance of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is critical and is emphasised in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000062"&gt;two-pyramids model&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between radicalisation of opinion and radicalisation of action. While the link between the two may be weak, radicalisation of opinion alone can pose a &lt;a href="https://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/3807"&gt;serious threat to democracies and open societies&lt;/a&gt; by eroding social cohesion and fostering polarisation. For this reason, it warrants focused study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, workplace burnout is alarmingly common, affecting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.vanede.nl/media/2669/gallup-iii-employee-burnout.pdf"&gt;three in four employees&lt;/a&gt;. This means a huge portion of the workforce experiences the emotional strain capable of fuelling extremist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority will never resort to violence, a society that becomes increasingly tolerant of extremist attitudes risks normalising destructive behaviours and undermining both democratic values and workplace cohesion. Moreover, even if only a small minority ultimately engage in violence, the consequences can still be profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organisational support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings also reveal an effective form of protection: &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b6e9be0e81ee13424f7140685a689bd2d85d7d3c"&gt;perceived organisational support&lt;/a&gt;. Employees who felt that their organisations genuinely valued their contributions and cared about their wellbeing were less likely to gravitate toward extremist ideologies, even when experiencing burnout symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a critical caveat to this: organisational support is most effective at mitigating the harmful effects of burnout before negative emotions take hold. Once employees have crossed that emotional threshold, additional support alone has limited power to prevent the escalation toward violent extremist attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers therefore hold the key to addressing burnout before it escalates into something more serious. Organisations must proactively invest in burnout prevention, not merely as a health initiative, but as a vital strategy for preserving stability, both in the workplace and in society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace, ensuring employees feel recognised and valued, training managers to identify early signs of burnout and respond proactively, and establishing open, safe channels for employee feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about fairness don’t stop at the office door. Broader perceptions of injustice in society may also fuel extremist sympathies, especially when individuals are already mentally exhausted. For instance, efforts to pursue the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-luigi-mangione"&gt;death penalty against Mangione to serve President Trump’s political agenda&lt;/a&gt; may deepen perceptions of systemic unfairness, which will only exacerbate radical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more than just workplace exhaustion or disengagement. It signals a deeper and more dangerous existential vulnerability. A workplace that ignores employee burnout doesn’t just risk lower productivity – it creates a breeding ground for ideological radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both workplaces and societies confront a surge in extremist sentiment, including support for violent acts framed as resistance to corporate greed, it is crucial that we learn to recognise the underlying psychological triggers. Burnout is one of them, and employees don’t just need support to do their jobs better – they need it to maintain a sense of meaning, stability, and connection in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burnt-out mind will seek meaning wherever it can find it. If the workplace fails to offer that, extremist ideologies are often ready to fill the void, with consequences that reach far beyond the office walls.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Why so? Because the first meal of the day replenishes glucose levels, boosting energy and alertness after an overnight fast. It also kickstarts your metabolism, improves focus and memory, helps regulate blood sugar and appetite to prevent overeating later in the day, and provides essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, many people are aware of the fact that a nutritious breakfast contributes to better heart health and overall well-being, and encourages healthier eating habits.

The most eye-opening result? For each extra hour breakfast was delayed, there was about an 8-11% higher risk of mortality (death from any cause) during the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, late breakfast times were linked with other health problems. Many participants who ate late also reported poorer sleep, fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, and worse oral health. Those are signs not just of bad habits but sometimes of under-recognized health issues. Genetic predisposition to “late chronotype” (natural inclination to stay up late and wake up later) was also associated with later breakfast times, suggesting some of the timing shift may be built in, or influenced by internal body clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="14175499" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="breakfast-timing" source="Orion"&gt;breakfast timing&lt;/keyword&gt; might matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about being an early bird and someone who chooses to stick to the clock a bit too religiously. There are several biological, lifestyle, and psychological reasons timing seems to make a difference, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Circadian rhythms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our body’s internal clock regulates many functions, like sleep, digestion, hormone release, and metabolism. When you delay eating relative to waking time, you may misalign your meals with optimal metabolic windows. That could reduce how well nutrients are processed and increase stress on systems (e.g., glucose regulation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep and energy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later breakfasts often go hand-in-hand with poorer sleep, fatigue, or disrupted routines. If you wake late or sleep badly, your body may already be under strain; so eating late might be more of an ‘effect’ than a ‘cause’ in some people. Also, delayed eating may reduce total energy/nutrient intake early in the day, which can affect metabolism and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Behavioral and functional implications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Older adults who have mobility issues, depression, dental problems, or fatigue may find it harder to prepare or access breakfast early, or may simply not feel hungry until later. These health challenges themselves are risk factors for mortality. Thus, breakfast time might be a marker rather than just a lever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you should do: &lt;keyword id="3045780" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="longevity-hacks" source="Orion"&gt;Longevity hacks&lt;/keyword&gt; and practical tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this insight to support better health (especially as you age), here are some simple, actionable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat breakfast earlier, close to when you wake up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to have breakfast within one to two hours after waking. If you wake at 6-7 AM, aim for breakfast by 8-9 AM rather than delaying until late morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintain consistent mealtimes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like sleep, being regular with when you eat helps your body expect food, regulate hormones, digestion, and energy levels. A schedule like breakfast around 7-9 AM, lunch around noon, dinner before 6-8 PM can help anchor your day. Missing or delaying meals often disrupts the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prioritize breakfast quality:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What you eat matters. A protein-rich, fiber-full breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar, supports digestion, and gives staying power. Think eggs + veggies, oatmeal with nuts/fruit, yogurt with seeds, whole grain toast + protein. Skipping or having sugary breakfast items may give quick energy but less sustained benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Look after sleep and wake patterns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since late chronotype, poor sleep, or delayed wake times are associated with eating late, improving sleep hygiene can help. Going to bed earlier, maintaining consistent wake-up times, and limiting exposure to screens before bed – all of these help reset internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor health signs and routines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you notice fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, oral health problems, or gradually delaying meals, these may be early warning signs worth discussing with your healthcare provider. Mealtime shifts may be easier to track than many other health markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating dinner too late or snacking heavily late in the evening can further skew your eating window and may compound the negative effects of a late breakfast. Light dinners, earlier evenings, and minimizing snacking can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNbzRSN1lGekk2eVdDbFREOTdPUUM3U0hwNlBFSVlQRTRXUlU1RTNzVW9qWk80a3JJOU1vd3AxM3pnZVg4RWhWbFVRZE4wNTVTYzg3akRPNWpITmNrU1o0cWRxN2U0SldqaFM4ai1tRGhOMkkxQllQdnFSUWNzTHJKOUhOVTIyQzR2QnQtMjZLdXhuYkZMdVpmMzAzd29xaVFkSlViVnFVZ2wzSGVlN0ZNSF91TlM0MDlzSlQ5WGJYWDR1TFUxM3FQeXo2NVNPbngzYmIyYTZjNUlSTzhzUXJITmEweHVjLWxIdmdmWjdvQkw2TmR0cHZzc0tiVzBvMEppSzJqc0pDQkNIeFZNNDk1T0VkOVh5aHY2YjRNeDdPV1paaE5TOG45M05SRnNYQzA</guid></item><item><title>权衡激素治疗更年期的益处和风险，因为FDA考虑删除“黑匣子”警告- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hrt-for-menopause-risks-benefits-fda-black-box-warnings/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hot flashes and sleepless nights are just some of the symptoms of perimenopause that have been disrupting Isabel Kallman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 53 years old, Kallman's hormones naturally started to decline, and the only medication available for her is menopause hormone therapy. For women experiencing the lead-up to menopause, hormone therapy treatment can involve using estrogen to help alleviate symptoms — but Kallman said she has been on the fence about it due to so-called "black box" labels on the medication, warning of the risk for stroke, blood clots, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kallman told CBS News she has been using "Fanny," a handheld fan that she keeps in her bag to help with some of her symptoms. But now she's considering hormone replacement as the Food and Drug Administration weighs removing some of the health warnings for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-breast-cancer-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;certain treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Rosser, who has been Kallman's doctor for five years, said she believes flawed research from more than 20 years ago overstated the risks of breast cancer because it focused on older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been overblown," Dr. Rosser, the director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian, told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shifting-world-of-womens-health/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the largest long-term study on women's health at the time, focused on older women who may not have started hormone replacement therapy until 10 or so years after going through &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menopause-grown-woman-talk-obgyn/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which raised safety concerns and led to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-menopause-slow-aging/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;longtime public misunderstanding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around hormone therapy, has since been found problematic in terms of how it was designed, according to Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. Now, health care professionals say factors such as age and dosing contribute to the safety of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that timing of treatment matters — a woman's age when she begins menopause hormone therapy, along with the delivery method, can substantially mitigate risks, Gounder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "an example of [how] science evolves," Gounder said of recent studies. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for a lot of perimenopausal symptoms, according to Gounder, who stressed that patients need to sit down with their doctors to determine what is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, treatment should start as close to the patient's final menstrual period and continue until about the age of 60, Dr. Rosser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to look at your risk and calculate your risk score," Dr. Rosser told Kallman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser has spent the past nine months working through the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-shows-hormone-therapy-can-benefit-womens-health-during-menopause/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and risks with her patient, who has a family history of breast cancer. While Kallman said she's still hesitant, she realizes hormone therapy may be her best chance at relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hoping that there is an opportunity for me to do it," Kallman told CBS News, adding that she hopes there's an option that will help her in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type of treatment is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Others include whole-body therapy like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pill-hot-flashes-women-menopause/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;pills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms such as hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As experts like Dr. Rosser continue to have conversations about how to present the treatment's pros and cons, an FDA-assembled panel has stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions. However, dozens of experts called for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that "removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk," The Associated Press reported. The group asked the FDA to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser said she sees it as a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a public health priority, and this is a sign that the FDA sees that," she told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

Nurrobi&lt;/a&gt; of the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine at &lt;a href="https://rspb.ihc.id/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pertamina Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Balikpapan, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-heart-health-and-longevity"&gt;Walking, heart health, and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics did not cancel out the effect of walking pace. In a large study, researchers found that people who moved at a slower pace and also carried a high polygenic risk score faced the greatest likelihood of developing coronary disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of sluggish gait and unfavorable genetic profile produced the highest risk levels, showing that these two factors reinforce each other rather than replace one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the results confirmed that both &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;walking pace&lt;/a&gt; and genetic predisposition made independent contributions to risk prediction, which improves when walking pace is counted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights that lifestyle choices and inherited traits each matter when it comes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UK Biobank &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/publications/walking-pace-improves-all-cause-and-cardiovascular-mortality-risk-prediction-a-uk-biobank-prognostic-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; reported that walking pace improves heart and other early mortality risk predictions beyond common measures, which helps clinicians sort risk better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-enough-for-real-life"&gt;How much is enough for real life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week, such as 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week,” stated the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; guidelines. A 20 to 30 minute brisk walk most days gets you there without scheduling gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity means your breathing and heart rate are clearly up, but you can sustain the effort. Short on time, you can split walking into two 10 to 15 minute bouts and still check the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily routines are easier to keep than heroic goals. Pick a start time you can guard, like after lunch or before dinner, and make that slot non negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-pace-and-heart-health"&gt;Walking pace and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of randomized trials in healthy adults found that exercise training increases heart rate variability, a marker of flexible autonomic control that is linked with better cardiac outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is an aerobic stimulus that can nudge the heart and cardiovascular system in the right direction when practiced regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 review found that physical activity serves as an effective strategy for lowering cortisol levels. Reduced cortisol is associated with steadier mood, improved sleep, and less strain on the body systems that manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace also shapes how your blood vessels behave and helps your muscles pull more sugar and fat out of the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over weeks, those changes support healthier &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and cholesterol profiles, which is one reason walking shows up in prevention and recovery plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-risk-drop-is-plausible"&gt;Why the risk drop is plausible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-walking-improves-mobility-and-prevents-falls-in-older-adults/"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; taps large muscle groups in a rhythmic way, so circulation becomes more efficient with practice. That consistency trains the vessels to relax more easily and the heart to do the same job with less strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy use rises during and after the walk. Over time, that improves insulin sensitivity, and better insulin signaling supports stable blood sugar and less inflammatory activity tied to artery damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system matters too. When heart rate variability improves, it signals a stronger parasympathetic brake and a calmer response to daily stress, which lowers strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-pace-without-gadgets"&gt;How to pace without gadgets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use landmarks and a clock. If you are covering about a mile in 15 to 20 minutes and can hold that pace for your whole walk, you are in a useful zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your stride relaxed and your arms moving naturally. If you notice your pace slipping near the end, shorten the stride a bit and stay smooth rather than pushing into a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hills, stairs, and wind will change effort. Adjust your pace to keep effort steady across terrain, and let the tougher parts build fitness without forcing breathless bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-the-habit-when-life-is-messy"&gt;Keeping the habit when life is messy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anchor the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walk-20-minutes-daily-to-boost-your-brain-power/"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; to a daily cue, like finishing a morning coffee or closing your laptop at a set time. Habits tied to a cue survive busy days because you do not have to renegotiate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a bad weather plan. Indoor corridors, covered malls, or a safe loop near home keep the chain unbroken when the sky does not cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chest pain, unexplained shortness of breath, or dizziness during exertion, talk with a clinician before pushing pace. The goal is steady practice, not heroics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace and regularity are the levers you control. A brisk 20 to 30 minute walk most days can shift your odds in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Promoting a faster &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; pace as a daily activity may effectively mitigate the burden of CAD,” wrote Nurrobi. The signal appears consistently across different groups and remains strong even after accounting for genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11043612/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNVDN4dEU5OVNlWmVGUXpZR3Nrb1dlVWwtQXRBd1ZablFRaTBRZ3ZHN0ItRmZGbEFRU0sxNmRoeEt2aDNzR1dIWmJEaThlVnpMMUxMYlpNOWNraDdrMWc1RVpfMHUxZWx1ZC1udzZ2ZFBzUkVTMmlSU1B4QW1XaVhBSWJqczVzaXFCR1hvdDdmT3JVT2xUMUYtYWtzQ3IxVTZrVjlGRUhjR08</guid></item><item><title>特朗普的哈佛削减威胁到生物医学研究界的一个巨人：关于微小果蝇的数据库- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/trumps-harvard-cuts-threaten-giant-biomedical-research-community-datab-rcna230610</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcd112" class="body-graf"&gt;For more than a century, the humble fruit fly has paved the way for many critical scientific breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab564c" class="body-graf"&gt;This tiny insect helped researchers figure out that X-rays can cause genetic mutations. That genes are passed on from parent to child through &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1933/summary/" target="_blank"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;. That a &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2017/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;gene called period&lt;/a&gt; helps our bodies keep time — and that disruptions to that internal clock can lead to jet lag and increased risk for neurological and metabolic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39c94e" class="body-graf"&gt;Those discoveries, along with nearly 90,000 other studies, are part of a key online database called FlyBase that researchers routinely use to help them more quickly design new experiments. These tests explore the underlying causes of disease and could help with the development of new treatments. Science builds on prior insights, and a handy repository of past advances serves as kindling for future discoveries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02c461" class="body-graf"&gt;The website receives about 770,000 page views each month from scientists working around the world on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00180-2" target="_blank"&gt;developing personalized therapies&lt;/a&gt; for rare cancers, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/201/2/377/5930058" target="_blank"&gt;modeling human neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ahg.12554" target="_blank"&gt;screening drug candidates for conditions like Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fc638" class="body-graf"&gt;Now, that critical resource is on the brink of layoffs that endanger its future and ability to make research more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2c4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;This spring, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump administration, as part of its broader $2.2 billion funding cuts at Harvard University, rescinded a grant used to maintain FlyBase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae9a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I use FlyBase every single day. It’s so essential,” said Celeste Berg, a professor of genome sciences at the University of Washington, who is not part of the team that operates FlyBase. “What we know about human genes and how they function comes almost completely from model systems like drosophila.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d1035" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans share about 60% of our genes with fruit flies, also known by their scientific name &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea3100" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase’s now-uncertain future highlights just how interconnected and interdependent research efforts are and how the effects of funding cuts to one institution can ripple worldwide. More than 4,000 labs use FlyBase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60506" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard was receiving about $2 million a year in federal funding to maintain FlyBase, which was the vast majority of the website’s total operating budget. But the University of New Mexico, Indiana University and the University of Cambridge in England are partners that help Harvard manage FlyBase and are beneficiaries, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-453ac6" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is not just affecting Harvard,” said Brian Calvi, a professor of biology at Indiana University, who is part of the FlyBase management team. “The ripple effect is to the international biomedical research community.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c9dcbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences rescued FlyBase with interim funding, but that support will cease in October, according to Norbert Perrimon, a professor of developmental biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2643" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-unfreeze-nearly-22-billion-federal-g-rcna228926" target="_blank"&gt;judge earlier this month ordered the Trump administration to restore funding&lt;/a&gt; to Harvard researchers who lost grants, but money has not begun to flow to FlyBase, Perrimon said. The administration has promised to appeal the decision, which could halt the flow of funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-219b4a" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Both Indiana and Cambridge were able to secure funds to keep their portion of the program operating into next year. The New Mexico position ended in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7deafd" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase, which has been operating since 1992, has received federal support for more than three decades. It curates and summarizes research papers, organizes findings about particular genes, and catalogs information about fruit flies that have been modified genetically to tease apart how certain genes guide normal development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-817034" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruit flies are among the most important animal models for biomedical research because scientists have been able to map their genomes and brains. They’re also relatively easy and cheap to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-277cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Berg, the genome sciences professor and avid FlyBase user, studies human development and how cells form organs. FlyBase allows her to search and identify genes of interest for experiments. She then tests how changing the expression of those genes affects the arrangement of cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4520d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Every year, thousands of fruit fly papers are added to FlyBase and summarized. Without FlyBase, Berg said researchers and clinicians would struggle to keep up and could miss key connections about particular genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56f6fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers with the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/research/model-organisms-phase-ii/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzqmPDx5s$" target="_blank"&gt;Undiagnosed Diseases Network&lt;/a&gt; use FlyBase to help identify whether genetic mutations in children could be contributing to rare and unexplained diseases. The scientists identify genetic variants in these patients and then compare those mutations to past research of those genes in flies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54a947" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase is now crowdfunding support on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b19b3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the importance of FlyBase to the broader U.S. and international scientific research community, we are hopeful other institutions and other stakeholders at Harvard will support those efforts,” said James Chisholm, a spokesman for Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, adding that several Harvard departments were “actively working to identify and secure additional funding to safeguard FlyBase’s operations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03d63" class="body-graf"&gt;Two Harvard-based staffers have already been laid off from their work at FlyBase, and another six are scheduled for layoffs later in September and in early October, Perrimon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2001d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we cannot retain the key personnel, it’s going to be very difficult to get back those people who have knowledge to keep the databases running,” Perrimon said. “That would be the point of no return for FlyBase.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c1d4b5" class="body-graf"&gt;The funding disruption is also threatening plans to move FlyBase’s data to a new long-term home called the Alliance of Genome Resources. Fruit flies are among several common “model organisms,” along with rats, mice and worms, that are used in laboratories and lay the groundwork for understanding human biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b5cc3" class="body-graf"&gt;The National Institutes of Health has spent about &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://reporter.nih.gov/search/aP_gy-lZWES6IOBy6zZN3A/project-details/10976322__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzh8OYkhq$" target="_blank"&gt;$5 million a year since 2017&lt;/a&gt; to merge several databases, including FlyBase, WormBase and the Mouse Genome Database, among a handful of others. Each contains information that human health researchers can cross-reference to study genes important for human health more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25e41c" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re studying human genes and you have to study everything that’s known, you have to go to all of these [websites] and learn the system,” said Paul Sternberg, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, who is leading the Alliance effort. “We want one-stop shopping.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe1314" class="body-graf"&gt;The Alliance’s budget expired June 30, and Sternberg said he is awaiting a funding renewal decision from NIH himself. He said the funding disruption at FlyBase represents a new, unexpected obstacle to making&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;research findings more useful and easier to scour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf2e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to do this fast, but when you’re losing staff and energy, that’s what makes it dicey,” Sternberg said. “Don’t throw extra roadblocks. That’s all we ask.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0b8ac" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase had planned to merge with the Alliance in 2029. Now, Calvi and others are pushing for a speedier merger, before FlyBase’s financial runway runs out.

The use of CT is on the rise, having increased about 30% since 2007, making the issue of CT radiation exposure and its link to cancer a growing concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulation in question is a CMS rule that was finalized in 2023 and slated to take effect in 2027. It requires hospital outpatient programs, which include emergency departments, to track and report the amount of radiation they use in CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule was originally meant to be mandatory for hospitals, but CMS in July proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/calendar-year-2026-hospital-outpatient-prospective-payment-system-opps-and-ambulatory-surgical" data-link="native" class=""&gt;making it voluntary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because some hospitals have said it may be complex to implement, especially smaller facilities that lack IT capabilities, according to CMS. Making it voluntary would give them more time to integrate and test the measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the reporting voluntary would be a “tremendous setback” for patient safety, said Smith-Bindman, who worked with CMS to develop a key measure used in the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMS gave Smith-Bindman and her UCSF team a $5 million grant in 2019 to create the measure to incentivize lower CT radiation doses. There was no technology at the time that would allow hospitals to track and report the measure, which must link electronic health record data with radiology data, Smith-Bindman said. So she and several other co-founders created Alara Imaging, which makes software that performs this function for hospitals for free. She has a minority ownership stake in Alara, along with UCSF and several other co-founders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert panel at CMS found Alara was the best way to roll out the measure reliably, and that the measure would lead to reductions in radiation dose, she said. Alara is a for-profit company but does not charge for this software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure takes into account various factors — including a patient’s size, the body part being imaged, and the reason for the imaging — and sets a cap for what’s considered an appropriate dose of radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The program being optional is going to lead to many hospitals not reporting on this measure, which would be such a backslide because that’s what’s really driving adoption,” Smith-Bindman said. “I’m trying to get the word out to say, ‘Yes, we care about CT doses. We care about safety. These doses should come down.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since July, she has been leading a campaign urging members of the public — patients, health care providers and health systems — to submit comments to CMS to keep the rule mandatory for hospitals. The public comment period is slated to end Monday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hospitals and medical physicists who work with radiologists on CT radiation safety disagree, and support making the rule voluntary. Some hospitals say they don’t have the resources to track and use the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do not have the dedicated resources within our health system to leverage the data gained from this measure to improve our CT radiation dose management,” one large health system in Idaho wrote in a public comment. “We do not see any value to improve patient care from this measure. Additionally, the software to interface with our electronic medical record might be free from the federal government, but the labor to implement it comes at a great cost, as our CT radiation technology is outsourced to a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others have raised questions about the measure used in the rule, saying it has not been shown to improve patient care and is inconsistent with some internationally recognized standards for CT radiation doses.And some expressed concern that hospitals would have to use Alara Imaging to track and report the data, which presents a potential conflict of interest because Smith-Bindman and UCSF have a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman said it is not a conflict of interest, and that neither she nor Alara stands to gain financially if hospitals use Alara’s free software to implement the CMS rule. Alara is a for-profit company but does not charge for this software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman said the measure has been tested at 17 hospital systems, where radiologists found it helped optimize radiation doses, and validated by the National Quality Forum, which sets standards for quality in the health care industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s long been known that exposure to high doses of radiation causes cancer. This has been shown in studies on Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors and on people exposed to nuclear accidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether radiation from CT scans causes cancer has not been widely studied in the U.S., though European researchers have found that children who’ve undergone CT scans have a higher risk of some cancers, including leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/ct-scan-cancer-ucsf-study-20271473.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that CT scans may be more harmful than previously thought, and account for about 5% of new cancer cases annually in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the 93 million CTs performed on 60 million patients in 2023, an estimated 103,000 future cancers are projected to occur, according to the study, which was led by Smith-Bindman. That puts CT scans roughly on par with alcohol consumption and excess body weight in terms of its contribution to cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children, especially babies, have higher cancer risk from CTs than adults because their cells are more sensitive to radiation and because they have a longer life span within which to develop cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the CMS rule mandatory will help limit excessive radiation doses and avert 25,000 cancers each year, Smith-Bindman estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:56:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNck9QTW01TzJMV29jRVl0eXRLQ1pnMEVlSmRhX2w1YldFT0dOcWFaRHpTWXN2RGFRLTVVYWZZekJrUndSc21KXzVVN2ZlSTNnb2NlcTI1d0hRZ0l1T3UtLVNYbkFEcGgydzA1eXd5OUFKdE5ONElET19FTmlfT2pxUGZiUQ</guid></item><item><title>诺和诺德股票（ NVO ）在三剂试验达到19 ％减肥后上涨- TipRanks</title><link>https://www.tipranks.com/news/novo-nordisks-drug-trial-achieves-19-weight-loss-fuels-rivalry-with-eli-lilly</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="R9U5xJmA undefined  h_pxauto fontSize6 fontFamilyregular mobile_mx3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare company Novo Nordisk &lt;a data-ticker="NVO" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo"&gt;(NVO)&lt;/a&gt; has reported promising results from its latest clinical trial for its obesity treatment. Notably, tripling the drug’s dose helped patients achieve significantly more weight loss, strengthening the company’s position as it competes with U.S. rival Eli Lilly &lt;a data-ticker="LLY" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly"&gt;(LLY)&lt;/a&gt; in the growing obesity treatment market. Following the trial results, Novo’s U.S.-listed shares were up 1% in pre-market hours on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Elevate Your Investing Strategy:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Take advantage of &lt;a data-link="article_promo" href="https://lp.tipranks.com/july-2025-50off/?llf=rss&amp;amp;timer=on&amp;amp;coupon=INTRO50P"&gt; TipRanks Premium at 50% off! &lt;/a&gt; Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, Wegovy is Novo Nordisk’s prescription drug for long-term weight management, using the active ingredient semaglutide, which is also sold as Ozempic for diabetes. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly offers Mounjaro and Zepbound, which use tirzepatide for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novo Nordisk Shows Progress, Yet Trails Eli Lilly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Novo’s two late-stage clinical trials, semaglutide showed strong results in testing a 7.2 mg dose, well above the current approved 2.4 mg dose. In the larger trial, patients lost an average of 19% of their body weight after 72 weeks, compared with 16% on the standard 2.4 mg dose and 4% on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the results were slightly lower than Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, which achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at its top approved dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, experts see value in the incremental gains. Remarkably, Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, noted that the extra weight-loss benefit is significant, especially as the cost of high-dose tirzepatide has risen in certain regions. He also pointed out that semaglutide 7.2 mg could offer a more affordable alternative if priced competitively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race for Weight-Loss Market Heats Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The race for the weight-loss drug market is intensifying as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk compete to capture market share. With recent trial results and new dosing strategies, investors and patients are closely watching how both companies will perform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Novo has lost ground in the U.S. to both Lilly and other copycat drugs, and its shares have dropped 60% over the past year. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/novo-nordisk-stock-nvo-under-pressure-as-it-cuts-jobs-and-lowers-outlook"&gt;Novo announced a major restructuring&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its global workforce by 11%, or about 9,000 jobs. Amid these challenges, investors have been hoping that Novo Nordisk would strengthen its pipeline of new obesity drugs, as many view Eli Lilly as offering more options in clinical trials. Even so, the latest data shows that semaglutide can still provide meaningful incremental gains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLY or NVO: Which Pharma Stock Offers Higher Upside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/healthcare-stocks"&gt;TipRanks Stock Comparison tool,&lt;/a&gt; we analyzed NVO and LLY to determine which stock offers greater upside potential, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

The research adds to prior reports of spikes in &lt;a href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019" data-link="native" class=""&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/apl9451317.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;injuries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32008905/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;traffic crashes&lt;/a&gt; after people lose an hour of sleep when daylight saving time starts in March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first real piece of evidence that staying in permanent standard time would be better, from a biological perspective, than either permanent daylight saving time or the current shift twice per year,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jamie-zeitzer" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Jamie Zeitzer&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., a Stanford psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor and the study’s senior author. “Until now, we’ve just had theories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitzer and his colleague found major health benefits to ending the spring forward from standard time to daylight saving time. Using mathematical models and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers estimated that sticking with standard time all year would prevent about 300,000 strokes annually and lead to 2.6 million fewer people with obesity nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason our seasonal time shifts are so damaging is how they impact our circadian rhythms, the internal clocks that regulate most body processes and are vital to a functioning immune system and sleep cycle. Out-of-whack circadian rhythms are linked to a wide range of health issues, including stroke and obesity. One way circadian rhythms get scrambled is by being exposed to light at the wrong time: morning light can help body clocks stay synchronized, while evening light can slow them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the best analogy is that your circadian clock is acting in the body like a conductor acts in an orchestra,” Zeitzer said. “With a weak conductor, it might still sound fine in the violin section or the flute section, but the audience hears a cacophony. And that’s what happens in the body, too, with everything just a little bit off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at the three possible time policies based on how they affect light exposure and impact circadian rhythms and overall health throughout the year. They found permanent standard time was best overall, permanent daylight saving time was second, and our current practice of switching back and forth was the absolute worst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings varied a bit based on region and between night owls and morning larks. Those who like to stay up later (you know who you are) bear the greater negative health effects of the seasonal time switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/657584/half-daylight-saving-time-sunsetted.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;widespread dislike&lt;/a&gt; for the more-than-&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Daylight-Saving-Time" data-link="native" class=""&gt;century&lt;/a&gt;-old institution of daylight saving time, the best alternative option remains up for &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-daylight-saving-time-make-sense-scientists-debate-pros-and-cons" data-link="native" class=""&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt;. Health organizations like the &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt; support standard time, in favor of more morning light. Meanwhile, bills proposing permanent daylight saving time, which means more evening light, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/139" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; Congress nearly every year, but have yet to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way they modeled this study is genius,” said Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh who focuses on sleep medicine but wasn’t involved in the study. “We know that we should end the twice-yearly shifts, but there’s this argument about which way we should go. They tried to show us which approach is best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California could in fact adopt standard time, joining Hawaii and most of Arizona. In 2018, California voters passed &lt;a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_7,_Legislative_Power_to_Change_Daylight_Saving_Time_Measure_%282018%29" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Proposition 7&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the state Legislature to end the seasonal switching between times — but so far, &lt;a href="https://calmatters.org/newsletter/california-bills-2024/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;bills&lt;/a&gt; there have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitzer acknowledges limitations to his study, such as not accounting for erratic sleep schedules or light habits, like late-night phone scrolling. He also cautions there are other factors that must be considered in a policy change, like the economic effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some scientists, a change is a no-brainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there is a great health argument for ending daylight saving time,” said Karin Johnson, a neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School who was not involved in the study. “Hopefully, policymakers will add this study to their data and listen to science and listen to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:28:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxObjhKWVBVQi1BWXhHcWZpZ0FWZHdSVFoyVVU4MkI3a25iTmZXMldJZkxFdHJVUnA0NklPdUNkQWpuVko2VGdRb0pkLVhzRHprdnRPN2VmS1h2ckRCYmhiWl9VWnBKMlZXaHRqS2U0ak03RWJKejlXdThTZ3pUOVJ0djBJVEEyMTQ3VDV0Qkkxcm1zdw</guid></item><item><title>关于“接吻虫”疾病的注意事项：症状、风险等-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/well/kissing-bug-chagas-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:27:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1PMkFTdFRUTXY0ZGp2VTJscmd2T1FlU04wR3k2aGF3VlhKc2dTYkFscmJLbkl3QjN5SXdJNHc3cFBrcnZmTXZkTkJ0cUszWVNBNnhraWZ3bzFWY1EwMEJyVlhxYi14ZXZVaVoyREZfUDczbkZFd0lGWUl2WQ</guid></item><item><title>在关键会议之前， CDC疫苗咨询小组增加了5名新成员- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5542390/cdc-vaccine-advisers-committee</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Just days before vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meet to weigh who should get COVID vaccines this season, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected five more members to the committee he purged of Biden administration appointees in June. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members of the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist at AscensionRx, who also hosts a podcast, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and an affiliate of the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/dr-kirk-milhoan-acip/" target="_blank"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an ob/gyn and functional medicine practitioner, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catherine Stein, an epidemiology professor at Case Western Reserve University, &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" target="_blank"&gt;who has claimed&lt;/a&gt; the government overstated COVID risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The new ACIP members bring a wealth of real-world public health experience to the job of making immunization recommendations," said &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services and Acting Director of the CDC in a media statement. "We are grateful for their service in helping restore the public confidence in vaccines that was lost during the Biden era."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advisory group – now numbering 12 members – makes recommendations that help determine which vaccines are offered free through the Vaccines for Children program, and what health insurers typically cover. They also influence state and local laws around vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The appointments expand the committee just before it meets this week in Atlanta. On Thursday and Friday, the members will be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/agendas.html" target="_blank"&gt;considering policies such as&lt;/a&gt; who should get the fall COVID-19 booster shot, and whether all babies should get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Short list of members leaked in early September &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members were among seven that appeared on a list that was first reported by the &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-rfk-jr-seeks-to-rush-7-new" target="_blank"&gt;"Inside Medicine" newsletter&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 3. Two others who were named then — Dr. Joseph Fraiman, an emergency medical physician, and Dr. John Gaitanis, a pediatric neurologist at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Rhode Island — were not appointed to the committee by HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to each of the new members of the committee earlier this month, when their names first appeared in media reports. Only one responded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, was still in the midst of the vetting process on Sept. 5. "I think I'd be an ideal choice for a committee like this," he told NPR. "I have expertise in clinical trial management and ethics, and my background in transplant biology allows me to understand the science of what is being proposed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pollak says he had not paid much attention to ACIP before he joined the committee, but he sees having non-vaccine experts on the panel as a plus. "I think it's a value to have broad representation of the community at large, both with and without the necessary expertise in order to formulate policy that makes sense to everybody," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while Pollack considers COVID vaccines "safe to administer and provided a benefit in that it kept down the severity of the illness and prevented hospitalization," he says the vaccine rollout was "poorly managed," contributing to hysteria and conspiracy theories that the government covered up harms and injuries related to the vaccine. "The notion that the government tried to 'cover it up' is false," Pollak says. "All of the information on adverse effects is readily available in the medical literature. The problem is it tends to stay within the profession and doesn't get disseminated widely amongst the public."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Kennedy's imprint on vaccine panel grows&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members join the seven others Kennedy named to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;panel in June&lt;/a&gt;, replacements he handpicked after firing all 17 of the panel's previously seated members. The replacements, who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;met for the first time&lt;/a&gt; at the CDC in June, include Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about COVID and &lt;a href="https://www.malone.news/p/patient-rights-are-not-a-scientific" target="_blank"&gt;opposed vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;, and Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management who gained prominence during the pandemic for criticizing COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The members Kennedy fired had been chosen for their medical expertise and understanding of vaccine policy, and had been formally vetted to ensure that they &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323771/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisers-conflicts-interest" target="_blank"&gt;would not directly financially benefit&lt;/a&gt; from any ACIP votes. They had been serving in overlapping rotations over several years to ensure continuity of expertise and process.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There are large gaps in the new ACIP's composition in terms of their missing expertise on vaccinology, their missing expertise on primary care, their missing expertise on cost effectiveness and clinical trials," says Noel Brewer, a former ACIP member who had served on the committee for a year before being dismissed by Kennedy in June. "These are folks who fundamentally do not understand vaccines in a deep way. I wouldn't take medical advice from them, and I certainly don't think they should be setting policy for the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since Kennedy overhauled the panel, the ACIP has seen major changes to how it operates, for instance voting to effectively ban flu vaccines with the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html" target="_blank"&gt;in their June meeting&lt;/a&gt;. The change was based on debunked claims without new scientific evidence of harms. This move, among others, has led top medical organizations and public health groups to question the integrity of the group's advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Misinformation, politicization of commonsense public health efforts, and sudden changes to federal vaccine guidance is creating mass confusion and diminishing trust in public health. As we head into another fall season sure to be marked by cases of flu, Covid-19, and RSV as well as the alarming reappearance of measles and pertussis, the stakes could not be higher," the presidents of five professional medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians wrote, in a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/vaccine-policy-us-aafp-aap-acp-acog-idsa-presidents/" target="_blank"&gt;June op-ed in Stat News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many state vaccine laws are tied to ACIP guidance. Some states led by Democratic governors are starting to reduce their reliance on the committee over concerns that future recommendations may be based on &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/06/nx-s1-5532121/states-vaccine-guidance-washington-oregon-new-mexico" target="_blank"&gt;"ideology and not science,"&lt;/a&gt; says Dennis Worsham, health secretary for the Washington State Department of Health, which has formed a vaccine policy alliance with California, Oregon and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas disease, known as the “kissing bug” disease, has long been thought of as a neglected tropical illness, but some researchers now argue it’s endemic to the United States. But a lack of awareness means it’s undercounted, undertreated and under-researched. What do you want to know about Chagas or other diseases spread by bugs in the United States?

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-025-02912-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Acta Neuropathologica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that a protein indicating brain inflammation appears in a specific brain region at the same time as the first pathological hallmarks of the disease. This discovery could pave the way for earlier diagnoses and new therapeutic strategies aimed at halting the neurodegenerative disorder in its initial stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys memory, thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. For decades, research has focused on two key features of the disease: the buildup of sticky protein clumps called amyloid-beta plaques outside of nerve cells, and the formation of tangled tau proteins inside them. Another significant component of the disease is neuroinflammation, a persistent inflammatory response in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inflammation is largely driven by the brain’s resident immune cells, known as microglia. While neuroinflammation is known to be an early event in Alzheimer’s, the precise timing, location, and cellular details of its onset have remained unclear. Researchers conducted this study to create a detailed timeline of these early changes, hoping to identify a reliable biomarker that could signal the disease’s presence at its most nascent phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the research team used a comprehensive approach, tracking the disease’s progression in a well-established mouse model of Alzheimer’s. The mice, known as 5XFAD mice, are genetically engineered to develop an aggressive, early-onset form of the disease that mirrors some aspects of inherited Alzheimer’s in humans. The scientists studied both male and female mice at multiple life stages: 1.5, 3, 7, and 12 months of age. This life-course analysis allowed them to map out the sequence of pathological events, from the molecular level to observable behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation began by establishing when cognitive symptoms appeared. Using a spatial learning test called the Barnes maze, the researchers found that female 5XFAD mice began showing significant memory deficits at 7 months of age, while males showed deficits at 12 months. This confirmed that any biological changes occurring before these time points could be considered pre-symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team examined the brains of the mice for the telltale amyloid-beta plaques. They discovered that the very first plaques appeared at just 1.5 months of age, and they did so in a specific brain region called the subiculum, an area associated with the hippocampus and involved in memory. In concert with this, blood tests revealed that a serum ratio of two amyloid-beta peptides, a known indicator of early plaque formation, was also elevated at 1.5 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, another blood biomarker called neurofilament light chain, which signals neuron damage, did not rise until much later, around 7 months of age. This timeline showed that amyloid pathology begins months before cognitive symptoms emerge and well before widespread nerve cell damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central focus of the study was a protein called Translocator protein 18 kDa, or TSPO. This protein is present at low levels in a healthy brain but increases significantly when brain cells are under stress or during inflammation, making it a key indicator of neuroinflammation. Using a technique called quantitative autoradiography, which measures protein levels in brain slices, the researchers measured TSPO across different brain regions and ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TSPO levels first increased at 1.5 months of age, at the same time and in the exact same brain region, the subiculum, where the first amyloid plaques appeared. As the mice aged and plaques spread to other areas like the hippocampus and cortex, TSPO levels rose in those regions as well. This finding directly linked the onset of neuroinflammation to the initial formation of amyloid pathology, long before any cognitive impairment was detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established this connection, the researchers sought to identify which brain cells were responsible for producing the excess TSPO. Using an advanced imaging technique called quadruple-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, they were able to simultaneously visualize amyloid plaques, TSPO, microglia, and a second type of brain support cell called astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the surge in TSPO was almost exclusively located in microglia. While astrocytes also became activated as the disease progressed, they did not show an increase in TSPO. Going a step further, the analysis showed that the microglia with the highest concentrations of TSPO were those in direct physical contact with amyloid plaques. Microglia located farther away from plaques showed much lower TSPO levels. This indicates that the TSPO signal seen in brain scans is not just a general sign of inflammation but specifically reflects the activity of immune cells engaging with amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if these findings in mice were relevant to humans, the team performed a similar analysis on postmortem brain tissue from people who had an aggressive, early-onset form of Alzheimer’s caused by a specific genetic mutation (PSEN1-E280A). This form of the disease has a rapid progression similar to that seen in the 5XFAD mice. The human brain tissue analysis confirmed the mouse findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TSPO levels were significantly elevated in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to healthy controls. The increased TSPO was again localized to microglia, and the microglia containing the most TSPO were those clustered around amyloid plaques. This confirmation provides strong evidence that the mechanisms observed in the mouse model are applicable to human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does have some limitations. The analysis of human tissue was conducted on a small number of samples, all of which were from male subjects. Future work should include a larger and more diverse group of human samples. Additionally, both the mouse model and the human cases studied represent early-onset, genetically driven forms of Alzheimer’s, which account for a small fraction of all cases. Research is needed to see if these findings hold true for the more common, late-onset sporadic form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are already beginning to address these questions by studying mouse models that lack the TSPO protein and by expanding their work to include late-onset Alzheimer’s cases. The ultimate goal is to translate these findings into clinical applications that can help patients before irreversible brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-025-02912-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Amyloid-β plaque-associated microglia drive TSPO upregulation in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daniel A.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some public health experts are worried that the votes will — at a minimum — raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m tightening my seat belt,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-director-susan-monarez-50dfbec849b53b4593755d2e6e616687"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replaced it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the three vaccines being discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past June, Kennedy’s ACIP voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-flu-vaccine-thimerosal-c5696bbc19f345323153d5336cb5e798"&gt;recommend flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that meeting, Kennedy &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC’s recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors’ groups and public health organizations, and prompted a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuit-vaccines-kennedy-95a1aa23c3f015f7a35a570f5ef8da36"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Days after Kennedy’s announcement, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;CDC officials said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government’s Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It’s now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this fall’s COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-kids-what-to-know-5ddb5e3e92b12a6f5044dc229e19590d"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then “that would take away access for roughly half of America’s kids,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 1991, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested in June they wanted to revisit the guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner noted that health officials used to rely on screening mothers before birth but that many cases were missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were lots of failures,” he said. “And so there were continuing transmissions from mother to child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MMRV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus — called varicella — also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a combination MMRV shot — measles, mumps, rubella and varicella — was licensed. The CDC initially recommended that doctors and parents use the combo shot over separate MMR and varicella injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within a few years, studies showed children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the ACIP &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5903a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;changed its recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, removing the preferential language and saying either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most pediatricians suggest separate doses for the first shot, but give the combined shot for the second dose, pediatrics experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there’s no new evidence about harms from MMRV shots, said O’Leary, of AAP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why revisit it now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This version of the ACIP is an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HHS announces new committee members&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, HHS officials on Monday announced five new committee members — bringing the roster to 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new members are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist and podcaster who HHS officials said is director of medication access and affordability for AscensionRx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-p0kFdcVkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Raymond Pollak, a transplant specialist based in Skokie, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Catherine Stein, a Case Western Reserve University disease researcher. During the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she worked with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; an Ohio anti-vaccine group and argued that case counts were inaccurate and that the coronavirus was not as dangerous as health officials portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚀 SpaceX introduces a new propulsion system to help maintain the &lt;strong&gt;International Space Station’s&lt;/strong&gt; orbit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔧 The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon&lt;/strong&gt; spacecraft’s trunk now features additional &lt;strong&gt;Draco thrusters&lt;/strong&gt; for efficient reboost operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌐 This mission marks a collaborative effort between &lt;strong&gt;NASA&lt;/strong&gt; and commercial partners like &lt;strong&gt;SpaceX&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📈 Future Dragon missions will further enhance the flexibility and capabilities of space station operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s latest mission to the International Space Station (ISS) marks a significant step forward in space exploration and station maintenance. As part of its 33rd cargo delivery to the ISS, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft not only carried essential supplies and scientific experiments but also introduced a novel propulsion system designed to boost the station’s orbit. Historically, this task has been managed by the Russian space agency using their Progress cargo vehicles. However, with the new upgrades to the Dragon spacecraft, SpaceX aims to share this responsibility, ensuring the ISS remains in optimal orbit. This mission underscores the evolving role of commercial companies in space operations, paving the way for future innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SpaceX’s Innovative Contribution to Orbit Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the responsibility of maintaining the International Space Station’s altitude has fallen solely on the Russian space agency. With the retirement of NASA’s space shuttle fleet in 2011, the task of reboosting the ISS became a Russian domain, using their Progress cargo freighters. These vehicles not only elevate the station’s orbit but also refuel its propellant tanks, enabling the station to perform maneuvers when necessary. However, the landscape is shifting as NASA collaborates with SpaceX and Northrop Grumman to enhance their spacecraft with reboost capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s recent mission introduces a new dynamic. The Dragon spacecraft, equipped with a unique propulsion system, aims to contribute to the station’s orbital maintenance. This new rocket pack is strategically mounted inside the spacecraft’s trunk section. It is designed to counteract the gradual decay of the ISS’s altitude due to the thin atmospheric presence at its orbit. This development marks a significant milestone, as it diversifies the means available to ensure the station’s continued operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wOEmRQ7gNo"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/prodigy-rejects-musks-vision-teen-who-joined-spacex-at-14-sparks-storm-at-16-by-leaving-for-a-rival-tech-venture/"&gt;“Prodigy Rejects Musk’s Vision”: Teen Who Joined SpaceX At 14 Sparks Storm At 16 By Leaving For A Rival Tech Venture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Technical Challenges and Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the new propulsion system aboard the Dragon spacecraft was not without its challenges. SpaceX engineers had to devise a solution that would allow the spacecraft to effectively boost the ISS’s orbit. The new propulsion pack is situated in the trunk of the Dragon, a hollow, unpressurized compartment beneath the pressurized cargo cabin. This innovative design includes two additional Draco thrusters, aligned with the station’s velocity vector to ensure efficient propellant use. These thrusters, coupled with six dedicated propellant tanks, allow for precise control during reboost operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s approach contrasts with Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft, which demonstrated its reboost capability in 2022. Although the Cygnus connects at a less ideal position on the ISS, its steerable main engine compensates for this by directing thrust appropriately. In contrast, the Dragon’s fixed thrusters achieve similar outcomes through strategic alignment and propellant management. This solution exemplifies SpaceX’s commitment to innovation in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VWnHoCFv10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/09/silicon-breached-the-neon-layer-chandra-observatory-reveals-massive-stars-violent-internal-collapse-before-supernova-explosion/"&gt;“Silicon Breached the Neon Layer”: Chandra Observatory Reveals Massive Star’s Violent Internal Collapse Before Supernova Explosion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Implications for Space Missions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of the current mission has broader implications for the future of space exploration and station maintenance. By equipping the Dragon spacecraft with reboost capabilities, SpaceX is setting a precedent for commercial involvement in orbital operations. This advancement not only supports the ISS’s ongoing mission but also paves the way for future projects. Notably, the propulsion system’s design is a precursor to a larger-scale version planned for the US Deorbit Vehicle, which will eventually decommission the ISS in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s continued innovation in space technology is evident in its plans for future Dragon missions. The ability to customize the spacecraft’s trunk to accommodate either reboost kits or scientific payloads highlights the flexibility and adaptability of the company’s approach. As space missions become increasingly complex, the integration of commercial capabilities will be crucial to sustaining human presence in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H1PaRexREG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/they-brought-something-back-from-space-dragon-capsules-6700-pound-cargo-contains-technology-that-changes-everything-about-earths-future/"&gt;“They Brought Something Back from Space” Dragon Capsule’s 6,700-Pound Cargo Contains Technology That Changes Everything About Earth’s Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative Efforts in Space Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between NASA and private companies like SpaceX and Northrop Grumman represents a new era in space exploration. By leveraging the expertise and resources of commercial partners, NASA can focus on advancing scientific research and exploration goals. The partnership with SpaceX, in particular, has been instrumental in enhancing the capabilities of the Dragon spacecraft, enabling it to play a vital role in the ISS’s maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collaborative model extends beyond reboost operations. SpaceX’s Dragon missions have facilitated the delivery of over 300,000 pounds of cargo to the ISS, supporting more than 1,000 scientific projects. These missions are not only essential for sustaining the station’s operations but also for contributing to research that has direct applications on Earth. The ongoing partnership between NASA and commercial entities underscores the importance of cooperation in advancing the frontiers of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As SpaceX continues to innovate and contribute to space missions, questions arise about the future of space exploration. With the successful integration of commercial capabilities into orbital operations, how will this influence the development of future technologies and the exploration of more distant frontiers? As we look to the stars, the role of private companies in shaping the future of space travel becomes increasingly significant.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. on Monday, just days ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/03/childhood-vaccine-schedule-at-risk-rfk-cdc-turmoil/"&gt;the group’s next meeting&lt;/a&gt;. They include an infectious disease expert who has pushed back on Covid-19 mandates and another who advocated for alternative, unproven treatments for Covid, including ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/09/acip-kennedy-to-name-controversial-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;STAT previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the appointees were under consideration. Now, with their appointments, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is up to 12 members, a few short of the panel Kennedy dismissed in June, saying the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;move was necessary to restore trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta to consider and vote on recommendations related to Covid-19 vaccines and shots on the pediatric vaccine schedule, including &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;hepatitis B vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy had appointed the first batch of new members prior to the group’s meeting in June. That meeting cemented the reintroduction of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;decades-old anti-vaccine talking points&lt;/a&gt; in national policy, as the group recommended that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/23/kennedy-approves-acip-recommendation-thimerosal-removed-from-flu-vaccines/"&gt;preservative thimerosal be removed from vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/25/cdc-vaccines-advisory-committee-meeting-day-1/"&gt;review long-approved vaccines&lt;/a&gt; on the childhood immunization schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC director is typically responsible for approving recommendations or not, which may mean the responsibility will fall to the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/jim-oneill-cdc-acting-director/"&gt;CDC’s acting director, Jim O’Neill&lt;/a&gt;. O’Neill stepped into the role after Kennedy ousted former director &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; over vaccine policy disputes. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new members are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirk Milhoan&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://driscollchildrens.org/doctors/kirk-a-milhoan-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pediatric cardiologist&lt;/a&gt; at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Texas. According to the HHS press release, he “holds a Ph.D. in the mechanisms of myocardial inflammation.” His &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt; on the website of the Independent Medical Alliance, a group formed in 2020 that has advocated for Covid treatments at odds with the medical mainstream, states he is dedicated to treating patients with “vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.” He has authored &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirk-Milhoan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two papers&lt;/a&gt; on Covid vaccines, including one that claimed the mRNA vaccines led to more cases of the heart condition myocarditis than the virus itself, and called for the shots to be pulled from the market. While the vaccines did lead to some cases of the condition, regulators around the world consider them to be safe and effective. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hillary Blackburn&lt;/strong&gt;, a pharmacist and director of medication access and affordability at the Catholic health system Ascension. She previously founded and ran a consulting company for pharmacists and spent more than a decade with Dispensary of Hope, which sources medications that can be redistributed to low-income patients. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Griffin&lt;/strong&gt;, a Polish-born physician based in Baton Rouge, La. Her most recent venture appears to be an annual “health and wellness fair” called All Things Wellness. Griffin previously worked as an OB-GYN at Ochsner Health before transitioning to lifestyle and root-cause medicine, according to her online bios. According to HHS, “she was among the first robotic-assisted gynecologic surgeons in the U.S. and has led efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.” She has promoted functional and naturopathic medicine, and &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2023-05-10/rape-and-incest-exceptions-voted-down-along-party-lines-in-louisiana-house-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;publicly supported&lt;/a&gt; abortion restrictions in her home state.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raymond Pollak&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/pub/raymond-pollak-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;physician in Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, who is also licensed to practice in Florida. Pollak was a whistleblower in a suit against the University of Illinois Hospital alleging that the hospital admitted patients for liver transplants when they &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/iln/chicago/2003/pr111703_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;were not medically necessary&lt;/a&gt;. The university paid a fine to resolve the case in 2003. According to HHS, he’s published more than 120 peer-reviewed articles and been a principal investigator on National Institutes of Health transplant biology grants and numerous drug trials. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Stein&lt;/strong&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. She is a Ph.D. scientist whose research focuses on tuberculosis, including genetic and environmental susceptibility, the genomics of resistance, and genetic variation in disease severity. According to HHS, she has published 115 peer-reviewed articles. She may be better known in Ohio for her testimony before state legislative committees opposing Covid vaccine mandates. Stein submitted remarks at a meeting early in the pandemic considering whether to make public &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20489546-cathy-stein-hb-90-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Covid data&lt;/a&gt; on testing, cases, and deaths. A year later she supported a bill that would &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20489546-cathy-stein-hb-90-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prohibit vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/b&gt;When Brent Chapman was 13, he took ibuprofen during a Christmas basketball game. It was a drug he had taken before, but what happened next was anything but routine: He had a severe reaction that caused burns all over his body, including on the surface of his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman was in a coma for 27 days. He lost his left eye to an infection and lost most of his vision in the other. His body recovered, but his vision fully never returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the last 20 years, I’ve been having close to 50 surgeries trying to save this eye, most of them cornea transplants,” Chapman said of his right eye. “We would put a new cornea in. It would last sometimes just a few months or even up to years, but it would just kind of never heal.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Greg Moloney, clinical associate professor of corneal surgery at the University of British Columbia, was able to restore Chapman’s sight this year with a rare procedure that involved implanting Chapman’s own tooth into his eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m very happy and am just taking in the world again, appreciating the little things. It’s been kind of surreal and kind of a euphoric feeling to it,” Chapman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure, also known as tooth-in-eye or osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, involves removing a patient’s tooth, sewing a piece of it into the cheek and placing the structure into their eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s considered a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a situation where a standard corneal transplant simply won’t work,” said Dr. Vicente Diaz, assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the Yale School of Medicine. Diaz was not involved with Chapman’s case but treats people who have &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17656-stevens-johnson-syndrome"&gt;Stevens-Johnson syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, the rare and sometimes fatal drug reaction that caused Chapman’s blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition causes severe inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes. In some cases, Diaz said, the immune system attacks and destroys the limbal stem cells that are essential for keeping the cornea clear. Without these cells, corneal tissue becomes scarred and keratinized, as if the cornea has skin growing over it, blocking light from reaching the retina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be triggered by any medication or infection, although certain drugs such as seizure medications, gout medications and antibacterial sulfa drugs carry a higher risk. There are also certain &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stevens-johnson-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355936"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt; that could put someone at a higher risk of developing the disorder. Diaz noted that it can occur at any point in a person’s life, even after previous exposure to the same trigger without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A tooth for an eye&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In a healthy eye, the cornea acts like a windshield, allowing light to pass through to the lens and then to the retina, where it is converted into electrical signals sent to the brain. The cornea’s clarity depends on adequate lubrication and a steady renewal of cells by limbal stem cells. In conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, those systems fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the cornea is permanently opaque and the eye rejects a cornea transplant, surgeons sometimes turn to tooth-in-eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A canine tooth, which is the longest tooth in the human mouth, is extracted&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from the jaw, along with a thin layer of bone around the tooth that provides support and blood, keeping it alive. The tooth is then shaved into a 4 millimeter-thick block and drilled to hold a plastic optical cylinder, explained Dr. Ben Kang, Chapman’s oral maxillofacial surgeon and division head of Oral &amp;amp; Maxillofacial Surgery at Vancouver General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shaved tooth, with the lens in place, is implanted into the patient’s cheek or eyelid for several months, allowing soft tissue to grow around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place,” Moloney said. “It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to make a hole in the front of the patient’s eye to create space for the new complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the tooth-lens complex is integrated with living tissue, it is surgically attached to the front of the eye, replacing the damaged cornea’s function. Tissue from inside the patient’s mouth is used to cover the tooth part of the device, giving the new eye a pink shade. Light can then pass through the clear lens to the retina, enabling vision again, provided that everything behind the cornea — the retina and optic nerve— remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moloney said there are two types of candidates for the surgery: people like Chapman, who have tried every other procedure, or those who are so severely affected by their initial disease that doctors know from the outset that other options won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surgery, which can take over 12 hours across two stages, is rare and performed by only a handful of specialists worldwide. But for people who qualify, success can mean regaining nearly normal vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world,” Moloney said. “It’s highly emotional for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman’s tooth was extracted in February, and the structure was placed into his eye in June. His last surgery, which straightened the lens to correct visual distortion, took place August 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Regaining the human connection&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Chapman was fitted with glasses on August 13 and now has 20/30 vision, meaning he can see details at a distance of 20 feet that a person with perfect vision can see at 30 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing he saw after his surgery was the skyline from Moloney’s 16th-floor office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting. When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult,” Chapman said. “Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the tooth-in-eye surgery, Chapman was close to giving up hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We definitely didn’t have any more options. The transplants were lasting such a short time, and they were becoming more risky to do surgically,” he said. “Emotionally, even when I would get a new one, I knew it wasn’t going to last. This opened a new door for me and a new chapter in my life. This also provides more stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman is looking forward to traveling – with Japan being on the top of the list – but he wants to “just see the world and take it all in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman’s favorite sight? His niece and nephew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have a niece and a nephew that are 4 and 2. They’re just so cute and so much fun,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is also a massage therapist and is looking forward to working again. “I’ve had a lot of time off work in the last couple of years with surgeries. I can give back and help people in pain and not make everything about me, and I think psychologically, that’s very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, Chapman said, he is excited to dream again and “to not be limited by the instability of this condition and be able to plan and think ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Before, I would always be afraid to plan because I’m afraid I’ll need emergency surgery or have an infection. It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having “human connection again visually” is something that people take for granted but is very powerful for people with poor vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been with him since he was a teenage boy. He’s waited till he’s 34 to get that,” Moloney said. “We’ve all waited a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

And about 93 percent of two-year-olds have gotten their first dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he warned there are still 'pockets of resistance' in the city, mainly among religious groups like the Orthodox Jewish community.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New York City has confirmed two cases of measles, which causes the signature rash pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cases come amid a nationwide measles outbreak that has totaled 1,454 cases across 42 states so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (803) of cases have been in Texas, while California has reported 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three people, including one in Colorado and two children in Texas, have died this year from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the largest outbreak since 2,126 cases were reported in 1992, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levine warned on X that the measles cases in New York City come as health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15066511/RFK-CDC-vaccine-schedules-state-bans-school-mandates.html"&gt;called for restrictions on childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt; like the MMR shot and called for research investigating a l&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14669303/RFK-Jr-drops-bombshell-measles-vaccine-autism-primetime-interview.html"&gt;ong-debunked theory that the MMR causes autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK has also relayed mixed messages about the MMR vaccine, saying at once that it is the most effective way to prevent measles, while also telling Congress that he believes that the increased risk of autism in children is in part due to a wide array of childhood immunizations recommended now compared to when he was a child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levine &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1967597550799663396"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: 'This news comes amidst concerted effort by RFK to undermine confidence in the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thankfully—for now—the measles vax rate in NYC remains high, giving us herd immunity. (93 percent of two-year-olds are vax’d). But pockets of resistance remain even here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The recent cases should serve as a reminder to all parents to make sure their kids are vax'd.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US has reported more than 1,400 measles cases in 2025, the highest tally since the disease was declared 'eliminated' in 2000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC map shows MMR vaccination rates among kindergarteners in each state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is an infectious, preventable disease caused by a virus that leads to flu-like symptoms, a rash that starts on the face and spreads downward across the body, and, in severe cases, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-f7dd5c60-8e51-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, brain inflammation, permanent brain damage, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is spread through direct contact with infectious droplets or through the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with a measles infection are contagious from four days before the rash through four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583809/rfk-jr-u-turn-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-milestone.html"&gt;who are not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; have a 90 percent chance of getting sick if they are exposed, even from sharing the same air, briefly or hours later, with someone who has measles. Three in 1,000 people who contract measles will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths typically occur from acute encephalitis, or brain swelling, when the virus travels to the central nervous system, or pneumonia if it migrates to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Levine, Manhattan borough president, wrote on X: 'The recent cases [of measles] should serve as a reminder to all parents to make sure their kids are vax'd'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Levine called out Robert F Kennedy Jr (pictured here) for an effort 'to undermine confidence in the MMR vaccine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before the current two-dose childhood vaccine’s approval in 1968, there were up to 500 US deaths each year from measles, 48,000 hospitalizations and 1,000 cases of brain swelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly three million to four million people were infected every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first dose of the MMR is given to children at 12 to 15 months, and the second is available to children between the ages of four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A vaccination rate of 95 percent is needed to achieve herd immunity, which New York City has. The MMR vaccination rate for New York State is 97 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But nationwide, only 92.5 percent of kindergarteners have gotten both doses of the shot, posing a threat to herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levine said: 'The best place to go for your child's MMR is their pediatrician.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also urged parents whose children do not have a doctor to contact NYC's public hospital system at 844-NYC-4NYC.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Microsoft's tool is 4 times better for complex cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Harvard Medical School &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/new-ai-tool-pinpoints-genes-drug-combos-restore-health-diseased-cells" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;published a study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a new AI model called PDGrapher. According to Harvard, the model can analyze the connections between genes, proteins, and signaling pathways inside cells to identify the best combination of therapies that would effectively restore healthy cell behavior. This could enable new treatments for conditions that have previously been unable to be found via traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The findings &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a summary of the study, which was partially federally funded, the authors explain that usual drug discovery approaches tackle one protein at a time, and work in cases such as kinase inhibitors -- drugs that prevent cancer cells from expanding by blocking certain proteins -- but can fall short when the disease involves interactions between multiple signaling pathways and genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Traditional drug discovery resembles tasting hundreds of prepared dishes to find one that happens to taste perfect," said study senior author Marinka Zitnik in the summary. "PDGrapher works like a master chef who understands what they want the dish to be and exactly how to combine ingredients to achieve the desired flavor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hed-ai-could-dull-your-doctors-skills-study-finds/"&gt;AI could dull your doctor's detection skills, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained the model on a dataset of diseased cells before and after treatment so that PDGrapher could use that data to identify which genes transform cells from a diseased to a healthy state. Then the model was put to the test on 19 datasets spanning 11 types of cancers, where it was asked to predict various treatment options without having seen the cell samples before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool accurately predicted the drug targets known to work and identified other targets with clinical evidence to support them. PDGrapher also outperformed "other similar tools," the authors wrote (though they did not specify any), ranking the correct therapeutic targets up to 35% higher and 25 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ais-not-reasoning-at-all-how-this-team-debunked-the-industry-hype/"&gt;AI's not 'reasoning' at all - how this team debunked the industry hype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified many ways PDGrapher can optimize drug discovery by identifying multiple targets that can reverse the disease. According to the post, this could speed up the process, streamline research efforts, and reduce instances in which complex diseases with multiple pathways, such as cancer, evade drugs. Currently, the team is using the model to tackle brain diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI in medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though still new, AI has made several recent strides for medical use cases. Last year, for example, AI models' tendency to hallucinate actually &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-ai-hallucinations-could-help-create-life-saving-antibiotics/"&gt;helped Stanford researchers&lt;/a&gt; find new drug compounds at an exponentially faster rate than they could have with basic computing alone. At the same time, however, studies show AI chatbot users are perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/patients-trust-ais-medical-advice-over-doctors-even-when-its-wrong-study-finds/"&gt;over-reliant on AI tools for medical advice&lt;/a&gt;, which can be factually incorrect or otherwise unreliable, and does not replace information from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDGrapher is availabe &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mims-harvard/PDGrapher" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;via Github here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ZDNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 19:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNTU5fSnF0Q0ZIRm1ZYlJySkJ1TlplZWRkVTFFa19pMGNSRkk5bXVCMURXYnFuYUVwZkZKSGJnZGxCb2dwbVFCb2JHZGNnTF9Ia0FrTVJVNVNMRnRpRHJ1X1N2ZnZtRTJwek01eHdiTVdMTEdVSzdnTWJURVV2UU01THM4b2txYXEwZ216enhfMF9mdXVxeW5rSkRhMVI3NFBpZGVqMUJ0aXZDUkZMOU5HZQ</guid></item><item><title>接种疫苗有助于我通过多发性硬化症保护自己和他人-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/columns/2025/09/15/getting-vaccinated-helps-protect-myself-others-ms/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently got my yearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/downloads/flu.pdf"&gt;influenza vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which protects against the flu. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “In an average year, thousands of people in the United States die from flu, and many more are hospitalized. Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related visits to the doctor each year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), I’m at a higher risk for more severe illness and flu-related complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. Thus, I choose to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection doesn’t fully develop until about two weeks after vaccination. Because I’m going out of the country at the end of September, I got the shot earlier than usual this year to ensure I’m protected and won’t get sick on my vacation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also got my &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/vaccines/index.html"&gt;pneumococcal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. It protects against pneumonia, a severe lung infection caused by bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. The CDC notes that this vaccine is recommended for anyone 50 and older, as well as those 19 to 49 years old with certain risk factors, such as an immunocompromised state. As with the flu, my MS puts me at higher risk of more severe illness from pneumococcal disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 56 years old, I’ve never received or been advised to get the pneumococcal vaccine, which I find interesting. I obviously meet the age recommendation, am at higher risk of complications, and am also immunocompromised because I take a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; to manage my MS. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/gilenya-fingolimod/"&gt;Gilenya&lt;/a&gt; (fingolimod) suppresses my immune system, lowering my white blood cell count. While this helps treat the disease, it also reduces my body’s ability to fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vaccine awareness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m a pharmacist, I don’t practice in the community setting, and my knowledge of vaccine requirements is limited. I became aware that I should get the pneumococcal vaccine after seeing a television commercial raising vaccine awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a good experience receiving both of these vaccines. I had no side effects besides soreness at the injection sites. It was more noticeable in my right arm, where I received the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get a COVID-19 booster, but the pharmacies in my area of Missouri don’t yet have access to the vaccine, and it’s unclear who will be eligible to receive it when they do have the medication in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I went out of the country, I contracted a severe case of COVID-19, which developed into pneumonia. The illness ruined my vacation, and I was sick for two months after returning home. I want to decrease my chances of that happening again, but I don’t think I’ll have access to the new COVID-19 vaccine before I leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read something that resonated with me: “Get vaccinated for others.” Vaccines not only protect me; they also &lt;a href="https://vaccination-info.europa.eu/en/about-vaccines/benefits-vaccination"&gt;help me to protect others&lt;/a&gt; who are vulnerable. This includes young children who aren’t fully vaccinated yet, people with weakened immune systems (like me!), pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m concerned about my own health, but that comment made me think about my family and friends who could also be at risk. Something easily preventable could change their lives. I’m glad that my choice to get vaccinated benefits those around me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Water-soluble vitamins are generally safer than fat-soluble vitamins because they don't accumulate in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you take too much of these vitamins, your body usually removes them through your urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Discuss your goals with your healthcare provider if you are considering taking a vitamin supplement. Some things to consider before starting a supplement include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;You only need small amounts of vitamins. Most healthy people get these by eating a variety of plant- and animal-based foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health conditions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If you are pregnant, breastfeeding, on a restrictive diet, or have other medical conditions, discuss vitamin use with a healthcare provider to be sure you are taking the correct dose and that it's safe for you.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfgzhcmg003q2cq9a34m10vz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The day after I had kidney stone surgery, I suddenly couldn’t pee. My bladder felt full, but nothing was coming out. I’m a urologist and even I was freaking out: I felt stuck, panicked and helpless. After what felt like five hours — but was really only five minutes — the urine started to flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00013b6n9i68fn1b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once I remembered I’m a urologist, I realized the problem wasn’t just my bladder. The problem was constipation from all the medications I had to take the day before surgery. Once that issue was sorted out, my bladder finally relaxed — and the urine flowed just fine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00023b6n86qgvsok@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My case was situational and temporary, and it could be for you, too. But for many people, difficulty urinating is a real quality-of-life issue that won’t go away easily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00033b6nak46n64s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem could be urinary retention, when your bladder is full but can’t empty. Or your bladder may be empty but you still feel the urge to go. Either way, the experience is the same — you’re trying to pee and nothing’s coming out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00043b6nai5zz60c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To understand why, I’ll go over some basic anatomy. Made of muscle fibers, the &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/urinary/components/bladder.html" target="_blank"&gt;bladder&lt;/a&gt; is a balloon-like structure in the lower abdomen that holds urine. At the bottom is a narrow region called the bladder neck, which opens into the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of the body. In men, the urethra runs through the prostate before reaching the penis; in women, it’s shorter and exits just in front of the vagina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00053b6ngjolzwpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For urine to flow, the bladder muscle must contract or squeeze while the outlet and urethra relax. If anything interferes with this process — a blockage, weak bladder muscles or poor nerve signals — the urine is unable to flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00063b6n0e9ab4c3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This issue is most common in men older than 50, but women and younger people can experience it too, especially if medications or other health conditions are involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00073b6n7bke75eq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In men, the most common cause is an enlarged prostate blocking the flow of urine. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/urinary-retention/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that after age 70, about 1 in 10 men will have developed acute urinary retention within five years, and by the time they reach their 80s, that number rises to nearly 1 in 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00083b6nzbt0jbgb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In women, nerve issues or a cystocele (a type of pelvic organ prolapse, or dropped bladder) can alter flow, but acute urinary retention is much less common, affecting only about 3 in 100,000 women each year.  Sorry, guys, this problem is more common in you, thanks to the prostate and longer urethra!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00093b6na36fdkko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is not just a condition of being old. Many cases, like mine, come down to something more everyday: constipation. When the bowels back up, they can physically change the angle of the bladder neck, essentially kinking the outlet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000a3b6ng9lh02g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medications are another significant factor. Think about the pills you might take for allergies or a cold — decongestants and antihistamines are known to slow or even stop urine flow. Some antidepressants, bladder medications and pain pills can have the same effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000b3b6nyz6hozh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other causes may include urinary stones, strictures, blood clots and infections that can block the outlet. For those with a neurologic condition such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, a spinal cord injury or stroke, the nerves that control bladder emptying can be damaged.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000c3b6n8fwtxohm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not all trouble urinating looks the same. A weak stream or stop-and-start flow is one thing — bothersome, but often gradual and not immediately dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000d3b6nslhpximv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you cannot urinate at all and your bladder feels painfully full, your belly feels swollen, you’ve tried to relax, you’ve had a bowel movement and still nothing comes out — that’s likely an emergency. Go to the ER right away. You may need to have your bladder drained with a catheter to relieve the pressure, empty your bladder and prevent kidney damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000e3b6n5z9lzfp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people have no symptoms at all. In our urology office, we’ll do an ultrasound scan of the bladder and find hundreds of milliliters of urine still inside. This “silent” retention can be just as risky over time, leading to infections or long-term bladder problems if left untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000f3b6n0wn3n15z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In one &lt;a href="https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=68293" target="_blank"&gt;hospital-based study&lt;/a&gt; of male patients, approximately half presented with acute retention, while about 30% were found to have chronic retention. That’s why it’s important to have routine checkups with your primary care doctor and tell them about any symptoms you may have — sometimes your bladder can be in trouble even if you feel fine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000g3b6nc55xtu82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first step is determining whether the issue is proper retention — your bladder is full but can’t empty — or simply having the sensation that you need to go but your bladder is already empty. Those two situations may seem the same, but the treatment is quite different. That’s why we review your medical history and get new, objective data. For example, we check how much urine is left in the bladder after you try to void, test urine and blood for infections, and look at kidney function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000h3b6n7zk0vj0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We also have tools that eliminate some of the guesswork. A uroflow machine can measure the strength and pattern of your urine stream. And, if needed, we can put a small camera (cystoscopy) into the urethra and bladder to see what might be blocking the flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Just this week, I saw a young man who was having significant trouble urinating — rare for his age. A quick look with the scope showed a urethral stricture, or scar tissue, that was obstructing the flow of urine. As urologists, we see similar issues all the time: Sometimes it’s scar tissue, other times a large prostate pressing on the urethra. In women it could be a dropped bladder. Different causes, same results — urinary flow is blocked, and the bladder cannot empty properly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000j3b6nh917oy11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In rare, acute cases — when someone is in severe pain and unable to urinate at all — we immediately insert a catheter to drain the bladder. More commonly, however, patients have minor, bothersome symptoms that creep up over time. When caught early, many of these problems can be improved or even fixed before they turn into emergencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000k3b6nxdel26ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to subtle changes, such as a weaker stream, straining or frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom. Don’t brush these off as just getting older. Review your medication list with your doctor and stay hydrated. Most importantly, don’t ignore constipation — it doesn’t just affect your gut; it can affect your urination, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000l3b6nueaeukcj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keep an eye on your bathroom habits the way you would your blood pressure or weight. Small changes addressed early can make a big difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000m3b6n24of7aaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Talking about not being able to pee can feel embarrassing or awkward, but it’s important that you tell your doctor if it’s happening to you. After all, having this problem is your body’s way of asking for help. I know firsthand how unsettling it can be since I went through it myself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000n3b6nbrfpt58o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In my case, the cause was straightforward, and the symptoms cleared up quickly. In other cases, the cause may be more complex. This is when a doctor can help determine whether the issue is a blockage, a nerve problem, a side effect of medication or something else entirely. Whether the fix is as simple as changing a medication or as involved as having a medical procedure to open the prostate channel, getting checked early makes all the difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000o3b6nlzcxcruq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why I shared my story — it was embarrassing even for me, but I hope it will help you avoid the same issue. Don’t ignore the symptoms if you have them. Just get checked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This leads to a build-up of fat in the bloodstream and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such imbalances in the gut microbiome are linked to serious chronic conditions. Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-5b1638a0-924f-11f0-9d30-d52ef5490f75"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14707027/silent-condition-raises-early-colon-cancer-risk-nafld.html"&gt; fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; affect roughly 38 million and 83 million Americans, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a healthy gut, small amounts of D-lactate are not harmful. However, diets high in processed foods, sugars, and fats can promote overgrowth of bacteria that produce the molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;D-lactate travels to the liver, forcing it to overproduce glucose and fat while sparking inflammation. This stress on the liver can cause steatosis, an early stage of liver disease that may lead to scarring over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To counter this, the researchers developed a biodegradable polymer 'trap' that captures D-lactate in the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In experiments with obese mice fed a diet containing the polymer, the trap improved &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13825531/young-diabetes-heart-disease-study.html"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, insulin response, and liver health, all without changing diet or body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggested the approach could serve as a stand-alone or complementary therapy for metabolic diseases, offering a potential breakthrough in the fight against type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Approximately 38 million Americans have type 2 diabetes. The latest research points to a potential new treatment that could intercept the disease in the gut by targeting a harmful molecule produced by the body's own gut bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obese mice, as well as people with obesity, naturally have higher levels of the lesser-known D-lactate in their blood, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that the gut microbiome was the source. Most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively, unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University, said: 'This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose - a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To test its effects, they gave mice a potent oral dose of D-lactate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their livers went into overdrive, producing more blood sugar and fat than ever before, confirming to scientists that D-lactate was not a harmless marker, but rather a powerful compound fuel that drives disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They aimed to create a safe polymer that would not be absorbed into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their polymer trap was a compound mixed in with the food given to the mice. When the mice ate the mixture, the polymer compound traveled to their intestines undigested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows estimates for global diabetes cases. It is predicted that the number of people with the condition will more than double by the year 2050 compared to 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As gut bacteria produced D-lactate, the polymer acted like a magnet, binding to the D-lactate molecules and forming a stable complex, which was too large to be absorbed through the gut wall into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentially, the D-lactate was trapped in a form that the body could not take in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of being absorbed, the entire complex continued moving through the digestive system and was excreted in the feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice eating the polymer-enriched diet had significantly higher levels of D-lactate in their feces, proving to researchers that the polymer was binding to D-lactate in the gut and preventing its absorption, forcing it to be excreted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had lower levels of D-lactate in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were no changes in L-lactate absorption levels, though. Researchers did not find any changes to levels in the mice's blood or fecal matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research offers a promising pathway to treat obesity-related conditions like type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) at its source, the gut-liver axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their approach, using a safe, biodegradable polymer compound, could lead to novel therapies that lower blood sugar, reduce liver fat, and combat inflammation without requiring changes in diet or body weight, representing a major shift from managing symptoms to intercepting the root cause of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The obesity rate among American adults increased from 21.2 percent in 1990 to 43.8 percent in 2022 for women and 16.9 percent to 41.6 percent for men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00328-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413125003286%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jonathan Schertzer, a co-author and a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) at McMaster, said: 'This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:20:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNemlBcGJxQ001djZWZ2NUWDhoQ3ZIY3ZSdFUxVU9RWVNrNl8xNmxWT1hzdWN4TnJJQTdIT2s4eUJUcm5BQ3REbzdkQ2IyYVlleXVOUGd0b0xHeUtWeWNkUzI1ZXhNb1MxOUFIZ1VQTTFoS185MmZCa002NzdzbGZDa3loc2xRMTNGSXlVVzQ3dmd3cFhobThEa242ekRVOEN10gGmAUFVX3lxTE9XYlU1N3JPYW9PaVE4YkQxR2tvNnVCMjdlal9jWjJwQTRQdXl3dTZvd282amtIeHZHVFktZ0tOWThYYkRJaUJicmZhd1dzMG1RVV92QU9XY1JtejVjbkRIY1pVel9YVlBNak53WHdraWh5T2FsVWpLREVJUUZ5M0IwOGl1SWwwWHZiUzEtTHF2ZldsZVhPcndpVjdQN2x0el9GZG1tVmc</guid></item><item><title>滑板车事故让母亲的“大脑从头脑中脱颖而出” -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15093727/mom-dead-brain-hanging-head.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-6b6a3b50-9021-11f0-b873-a1b9191d5971"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; mom 'came back from the dead' after an &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/e-scooters/index.html" id="mol-6b61fdf0-9021-11f0-b873-a1b9191d5971"&gt;e-scooter&lt;/a&gt; accident left her brain 'hanging out of' her head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Savanah White, 28, and her seven-year-old son Malakye were crossing an intersection on July 24, 2024, when a car &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14376849/warning-burns-exploding-e-scooters.html"&gt;knocked them off their e-scooter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White smashed her face on the ground, breaking 26 bones and leaving part of her brain sticking out from her forehead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injury left her 'clinically dead' after her heart stopped for more than a minute due to a lack of oxygen to the brain and the brain being unable to send signals to her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, a chaplain was called in to deliver last rites and discuss funeral arrangements with White's family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking about the accident, White said: 'We were going back home to my apartment, but first we were stopping at a gas station across the street to get ice cream. But we never made it across the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was pulling out of the intersection, and a red car was speeding straight through. I... grabbed my son. We flew about 25 feet in the air, [then] hit the concrete.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local reports at the time said police were investigating and looking for suspects. The Daily Mail was unable to secure further updates on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Savanah White, 28, and her son were knocked off their e-scooter in July 2024. The accident left part of her brain hanging out of her head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White is pictured here after the accident. She was clinically dead for over a minute and broke 26 bones in her face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I lost consciousness because part of my brain had actually come out of my forehead. I was clinically dead for a minute and 24 seconds.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also suffered a broken pelvis, a collapsed lung, two strokes and an aneurysm, which is a bulge in the weak area of a blood vessel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While harmless on their own, aneurysms can rupture and cause potentially fatal bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was hospitalized for three weeks as a result of her collective injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear whether White or her son were wearing a helmet while riding the e-scooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everything was so bad and I was so mangled up, they didn't know if I would make it to the surgeries or not,' White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After a couple of days, I was stable enough to have surgery - but I didn't properly wake up for six days.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors took extra skin from White's C-section scar and stitched it to her forehead - a procedure known as a skin graft. They implanted metal plates into her face to hold the 26 broken bones together.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Malakye, now eight, was hospitalized with a broken leg and required two head surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After White regained consciousness, she was in denial about everything that had happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I woke up on the hospital floor. The security guard stated that I had been trying to escape the hospital. I didn't think I got hit. I kept ripping my trach [tracheostomy tube] out and trying to leave to get back to my kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They said, 'You're in the hospital. You got hit by a car.' I said, 'No, I'm not, no, I didn't.' They finally gave me a mirror and I looked at my face and I thought, 'Oh my god, I did.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a scan of White's broken facial bones after the accident&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White and her son Malakye (pictured) have both made a full recovery, though White still suffers from PTSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a year later, both mother and son have recovered, and only a small 'Harry Potter' scar remains on White's forehead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the accident left her with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the damage in her facial bones means she will be 'unable to smell anything ever again' as severe injuries can block nasal passages and damage olfactory nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White said she is still 'terrified of driving' and struggles to cope with the stress by herself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she also said the ordeal gave her a new perspective and appreciation for life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;span&gt;[While unconscious], I went through a rainbow tunnel, and I saw colors and lights that don't even exist here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw everything: the Earth, heaven, hell, all dimensions.

We also know that people that have periodontal disease typically have markers of inflammation," said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does that connect to chronic disease? Inflammation can cause vascular disease — the narrowing, weakening or even blockage of blood vessels — that can damage organs such as the kidneys, lungs, liver and of course the brain. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of cognitive deterioration after Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation also riles up the immune system, which can spiral out of control and attack the heart and other organs. Chronic inflammation also promotes insulin resistance and cellular dysfunction that can lead to type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, a growing concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It certainly makes sense that if you are eating a very clean, predominantly plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet, inflammation is down," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But this can't be the American version of the Mediterranean diet — the one with tons of lamb and feta cheese," he added. "This has to be the real deal — a true plant-first diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found the award-winning &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50550090" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones and a healthier heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;This can't be the American version of the Mediterranean diet — the one with tons of lamb and feta cheese. This has to be the real deal — a true plant-first diet.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health in Denver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Higher intake of red meat also linked to risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jper.70016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Periodontology, included 200 study participants in the United Kingdom. Scientists performed dental exams and took blood samples — participants also filled out dietary questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Low adherence to Mediterranean diet and higher red meat consumption were associated with severity of periodontal disease," said senior study author Luigi Nibali, a dentist and professor of periodontology at King's College London in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the people who ate more red meat and did not follow the Mediterranean diet had higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These markers increase in the presence of trauma or inflammation anywhere in the body. However, sometimes there is an exaggerated response which can lead to more gum disease. Higher levels of these markers mean more inflammation," Nibali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Higher consumption of vegetables, legumes and dairy products were correlated with lower inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, so they seem to be helpful. There were some beneficial trends also for fruit and olive oil," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, prior research has shown that chewing green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, root vegetables, apples, and citrus fruit — all key parts of the Mediterranean diet — can promote healthy teeth and gums. These beneficial foods provide "nutrients and a salivary response that improves bacterial health, which then improves overall inflammation," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study's finding are not surprising, Freeman said, "it's certainly a good reminder to pay attention to your teeth. And then if you eat a diet that is more in line with the health of the body, everything seems to be better, including your teeth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;The narrative around aging needs an update. While culture paints the 70s as decline, mounting research reveals something different: people who reach this milestone with the right practices often report it as their happiest time. They're not defying aging—they're doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference isn't luck or genetics. It's habits. Small, consistent choices that compound over decades, creating what scientists call &lt;a href="https://www.brightfocus.org/resource/healthy-aging-and-cognitive-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;—essentially a buffer against age-related changes. These aren't extreme measures. They're deceptively simple daily practices anyone can adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They treat learning like daily vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People thriving in their 70s never stop being students. They tackle unfamiliar subjects with freshman enthusiasm—languages, instruments, topics they never had time for. This isn't busywork; it's brain architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31732015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows challenging your brain with novel learning creates neural pathways even late in life. The brain remains plastic, forming connections and compensating for changes. Those who keep learning don't just maintain—they improve. The key is genuine challenge. Crosswords don't count after 30 years. It's struggling with something truly new that builds resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They prioritize people over everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthiest 70-somethings understand what &lt;a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/12/18/how-social-connection-supports-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longevity research&lt;/a&gt; confirms: relationships are medicine. They invest in friendships like others invest in portfolios. They show up—coffee dates, phone calls, groups, volunteering. Not from obligation, but because connection is survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong social ties increase longevity by 50 percent—rivaling the benefits of quitting smoking. The mechanism is both psychological and physiological: connection reduces inflammation, lowers stress hormones, strengthens immunity. But quality beats quantity. Deep connections trump superficial dozens. Thriving 70-year-olds curate their circles, keeping relationships that energize, not drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They move without calling it exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone aging well—you'll see constant, gentle movement. Not gym sessions. Just movement woven through life. Gardening, walking for coffee, taking stairs, kitchen dancing. They've discovered what Blue Zone researchers observe: the healthiest populations don't exercise; they never stop moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movement increases brain blood flow, promotes cell growth, enhances neural connections. Those who thrive don't treat movement as punishment. They've made it inevitable, enjoyable, joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They guard sleep like gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While younger people weaponize exhaustion, those excelling in their 70s know better. They maintain sleep schedules with religious precision. Bedtime isn't negotiable. Wake time doesn't vary. They've engineered environments that honor sleep's role in brain maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep clears metabolic waste from the brain, consolidates memories, supports cognitive reserve. The thriving don't sleep well by accident. They've created it—blackout curtains, cool temperatures, evening screen limits, unwavering consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They engage with purpose, not busyness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirement isn't retreat for those living their best 70s. They contribute meaningfully—mentoring, volunteering, creating, teaching. This isn't staying busy; it's staying necessary. They need to feel needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/todays-research-on-aging-44-more-than-a-feeling-how-social-connection-protects-health-in-later-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social engagement research&lt;/a&gt; links purpose in later life with better health, cognition, and longevity. Purpose drives healthy habits and connections while influencing stress and inflammation cellularly. The key: authentic engagement aligned with values, utilizing accumulated wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They master the art of letting go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the secret of successful aging: strategic abandonment. People thriving at 70 have become ruthless life editors. They've stopped maintaining everything and everyone. They pour energy into what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach means fewer goals, greater intensity. Give up night driving, become the morning's most reliable volunteer. Stop remembering everything, start writing everything. Recognize limits as opportunities to redirect energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those living their best 70s aren't following complex formulas. No biohacking, exotic supplements, or extreme regimens. Just simple things done consistently: learning, connecting, moving, sleeping, contributing, choosing wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These habits interconnect beautifully. Social connection motivates movement. Movement improves sleep. Sleep enhances learning. Learning provides purpose. Purpose strengthens bonds. It's not six habits—it's one integrated life approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve science tells us your brain at 70 reflects decades of daily choices. But here's hope: it's never too late. The brain stays plastic. Relationships can strengthen. Purpose emerges at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe those thriving at 70 understand something profound: aging well isn't fighting time but using it wisely. The best decade isn't the youngest—it's when you finally know what matters and have wisdom to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Anything that is polysyllabic and Latinate doesn’t sound threatening enough,” said &lt;a href="https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/tcd/people/michael-ghil"&gt;Michael Ghil&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies theoretical climate dynamics. “‘Tipping points’ does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that there had been major shifts in the Earth’s climate was by then well established. Scientists had found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5381.1342"&gt;geological evidence&lt;/a&gt; that supported the Snowball Earth hypothesis. They’d seen hints that patterns in deep ocean currents had once looked very different. And six thousand years ago, they’d discovered, the Sahara Desert was a lush Eden. Only later did it reach a tipping point that transformed it into a sea of sand; today, hippopotamus bones lie buried beneath its dunes, a reminder of that bygone era. The history of Earth’s climate is full of such rapid, massive transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Tim Lenton brought the language of tipping points into the world of climate science.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s the right math to describe those changes? Scientists who study tipping points readily admit that the term can be somewhat vague. Sometimes it’s used loosely to describe any large, sudden change that arises from small perturbations. Other times it’s used in a more specific and technical way, to signify an irreversible bifurcation that has a rigorous mathematical definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the global climate is a much more complicated system than Peter Lake. The oceans and atmosphere are massive and, importantly, open, shaped by far-reaching forces that act on timescales ranging from hours to eons. The forcing of the system toward a bifurcation — caused by, say, a gradual buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — is defined by myriad subtle and interconnected variables. These “dimensions,” as mathematicians call them, can affect one another in complicated feedback loops. Where do you even start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the climate, a load of people basically argue, ‘Oh, because it’s high-dimensional, you won’t get this simple, low-order bifurcation or tipping behavior,’” Lenton said. “They thought it couldn’t be that simple when you got into all the messy complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But physicists studying bifurcations had found that near or at the point of transition, the behavior of a complex system can simplify as it passes from one state to another. “Sometimes a high-dimensional system can tip,” said Lenton, “and when it gets near tipping, it starts to behave like a much lower-dimensional system.” The lesson, he added, echoes the one learned at Peter Lake: to “simplify without oversimplifying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, while bifurcations offer a helpful way to understand many past climatic changes, looking into the future presents new challenges. At Peter Lake, ecologists had the luxury of observation. Pay close enough attention to the water, and it’s possible to see attractors come and go, and to study their dynamics. Early warning signals become clear, in part, because the progression from a murky lake to a clear one is predictable under certain forcing conditions. But often, climate scientists can’t directly observe multiple states of the Earth. While they may have clues about where the climate is heading, they must also make many assumptions. This includes assumptions about the relationships between variables, about what a new equilibrium state might look like after a tipping point is reached, and about the nature of that tipping point — whether it’s caused by slowly adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, by a sudden change in the pace of carbon dioxide production, or by random, short-term perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This seems to disagree with findings from an earlier study, published &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33424809/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33424809/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found the opposite effect — that targeting the virus inadvertently worsened the fungal infection. (Rocha noted that there could be several reasons for the divergent results, including the fact that each research team used different approaches to render their fungal strains virus-free.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/norman.vanrhijn" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/norman.vanrhijn" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norman van Rhijn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research fellow at the Manchester Fungal Infection Group, said the finding uncovered by Rocha and colleagues was completely novel. "This has been a big step towards understanding the virulence capacity of this fungus and has the potential to broaden these findings in other human pathogens," van Rhijn, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="675edaaa-6ec6-4802-8433-e913f94d9a73"&gt;Rocha and her team found that the fungi exposed to antivirals reproduced less effectively and showed reduced melanin production; in many disease-causing fungi, melanin boosts virulence and the ability to survive in harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus itself cannot harm mice or humans, since it needs specific receptors and proteins to bind to, and these are absent in the mammals, Rocha said. Each fungus-infecting virus is usually specific to one fungal species, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like in the case of this one, it can only infect &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;," Rocha said. "It's not able to infect other fungi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think one way the virus helps the fungus thrive is by controlling some of the processes by which the fungus processes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic molecule involved in making proteins. The virus somehow improves the fungus' stress responses and protein synthesis, thus strengthening survival in hostile conditions. They also saw that human immune cells found it harder to kill virus-infected strains of the fungus, compared with uninfected strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ef592843-3317-488b-86cb-42352caa6976"&gt;If the antivirals used to target AfuPmV-1M in the mice work as effectively in humans, future therapies could use the drug to weaken the fungus enough for the immune system or antifungal drugs to clear it from the body, the study authors think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocha suspects other fungal pathogens that infect people may also be infected with similar viruses that boost their resilience. Together with her colleagues, she is investigating the infection mechanisms involved in infected and uninfected fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our article represents only the initial step of this investigation," she told Live Science. "Our broader goal is to provide a more comprehensive explanation of how the process unfolds at the molecular level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-JvqWSxkwxkTDoV6hdoEpTe-X47ZhHQh8Pg5xm25CIwbkxr3NiYP9Wrm" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-JvqWSxkwxkTDoV6hdoEpTe-X47ZhHQh8Pg5xm25CIwbkxr3NiYP9Wrm slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That’s mostly true for older adults, but for younger folks under 65, especially women, heart attacks often have other causes that doctors haven’t paid enough attention to. This &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.012" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at over 15 years of data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project and found some surprising patterns in what triggers heart attacks in these younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/being-too-thin-could-be-deadlier-than-being-overweight-research-shows/articleshow/123893319.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Being too thin could be deadlier than being overweight, research shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/are-bell-peppers-keto-friendly-nutrition-facts-you-should-know/articleshow/123891905.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Are bell peppers keto-friendly? Nutrition facts you should know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, the usual suspect, artery-clogging plaque (known as atherosclerosis), still causes most heart attacks overall. But here’s the kicker: while it was behind about 75% of heart attacks in men under 65, it only accounted for about 47% of those in women under 65. That means for women, more than half of their heart attacks come from different, less-known causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lesser known reasons of heart attack in young women&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those “hidden” causes is spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is when a tear suddenly forms in a coronary artery, causing blood clots and blocking blood flow without any plaque buildup. SCAD is especially common in younger women who often seem healthy otherwise. What’s scary is that SCAD is often missed or mistaken for a typical heart attack caused by plaque, and if doctors treat it like a usual heart attack with stents or surgery, it can do more harm than good. This study found SCAD is nearly six times more common in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nontraditional cause this study pointed out was heart attacks triggered by stressors like anemia or infections. These triggers appear to cause what you might call “stress heart attacks,” which were the second most common cause overall here, and they came with the highest death rates over five years, about 33%. That means people who had heart attacks triggered by things like severe infections actually had a tougher time surviving than those with classic heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/prediabetes-warning-5-morning-symptoms-that-could-be-the-first-sign/amp_etphotostory/123844943.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Prediabetes warning: 5 morning symptoms that could be the first sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-you-drink-a-day-to-pass-kidney-stones-naturally/amp_articleshow/123879713.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;How Many Glasses Of Water Should You Drink A Day To Pass Kidney Stones Naturally?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also noted that “truly unexplained” heart attacks are very rare, less than 3% after doctors carefully reviewed cases. That’s good news because it means most heart attacks have identifiable reasons, which can help doctors tailor better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this all matter? Well, this research spotlights how critical it is to know the exact cause of a heart attack, not just treat the symptoms. When doctors misunderstand the root cause, treatments can be less effective or even risky. For example, someone with SCAD might receive a stent they don’t actually need, putting them at new risks. Understanding a heart attack’s real cause can guide safer and smarter care, and hopefully, prevent the attack from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap it up, here are the main takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart attacks in younger adults, especially women, often have causes beyond clogged arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SCAD is a common but under-recognized cause in younger women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress-related triggers like anemia or infection cause dangerous heart attacks with high death rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Misdiagnosing the cause can lead to inappropriate treatments that might do more harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awareness and precise diagnosis are key to improving outcomes and recovery for younger heart attack patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reminds us that not all heart attacks are the same. The more we learn about these hidden causes, the better we get at protecting people’s hearts—especially younger women who might not fit the usual heart attack mold. If something feels off, don’t hesitate to ask questions and push for answers.

It was a drug he had taken before, but what happened next was anything but routine: He had a severe reaction that caused burns all over his body, including on the surface of his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman was in a coma for 27 days. He lost his left eye to an infection and lost most of his vision in the other. His body recovered, but his vision fully never returned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For the last 20 years, I’ve been having close to 50 surgeries trying to save this eye, most of them cornea transplants,” Chapman said of his right eye. “We would put a new cornea in. It would last sometimes just a few months or even up to years, but it would just kind of never heal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Dr. Greg Moloney, clinical associate professor of corneal surgery at the University of British Columbia, was able to restore Chapman’s sight this year with a rare procedure that involved implanting Chapman’s own tooth into his eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m very happy and am just taking in the world again, appreciating the little things. It’s been kind of surreal and kind of a euphoric feeling to it,” Chapman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The procedure, also known as tooth-in-eye or osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, involves removing a patient’s tooth, sewing a piece of it into the cheek and placing the structure into their eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s considered a last resort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a situation where a standard corneal transplant simply won’t work,” said Dr. Vicente Diaz, assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the Yale School of Medicine. Diaz was not involved with Chapman’s case but treats people who have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, the rare and sometimes fatal drug reaction that caused Chapman’s blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition causes severe inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes. In some cases, Diaz said, the immune system attacks and destroys the limbal stem cells that are essential for keeping the cornea clear. Without these cells, corneal tissue becomes scarred and keratinized, as if the cornea has skin growing over it, blocking light from reaching the retina.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be triggered by any medication or infection, although certain drugs such as seizure medications, gout medications and antibacterial sulfa drugs carry a higher risk. There are also certain genetic factors that could put someone at a higher risk of developing the disorder. Diaz noted that it can occur at any point in a person’s life, even after previous exposure to the same trigger without incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tooth for an eye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a healthy eye, the cornea acts like a windshield, allowing light to pass through to the lens and then to the retina, where it is converted into electrical signals sent to the brain. The cornea’s clarity depends on adequate lubrication and a steady renewal of cells by limbal stem cells. In conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, those systems fail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the cornea is permanently opaque and the eye rejects a cornea transplant, surgeons sometimes turn to tooth-in-eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A canine tooth, which is the longest tooth in the human mouth, is extracted from the jaw, along with a thin layer of bone around the tooth that provides support and blood, keeping it alive. The tooth is then shaved into a 4 millimeter-thick block and drilled to hold a plastic optical cylinder, explained Dr. Ben Kang, Chapman’s oral maxillofacial surgeon and division head of Oral &amp;amp; Maxillofacial Surgery at Vancouver General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo.jpg" alt="cnn L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777618" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-225x300.jpg 225w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-860x1147.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-375x500.jpg 375w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The shaved tooth, embedded with a plastic optical cylinder. | Courtesy Greg Moloney via CNN Newsource&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The shaved tooth, with the lens in place, is implanted into the patient’s cheek or eyelid for several months, allowing soft tissue to grow around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place,” Moloney said. “It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next step is to make a hole in the front of the patient’s eye to create space for the new complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the tooth-lens complex is integrated with living tissue, it is surgically attached to the front of the eye, replacing the damaged cornea’s function. Tissue from inside the patient’s mouth is used to cover the tooth part of the device, giving the new eye a pink shade. Light can then pass through the clear lens to the retina, enabling vision again, provided that everything behind the cornea — the retina and optic nerve— remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moloney said there are two types of candidates for the surgery: people like Chapman, who have tried every other procedure, or those who are so severely affected by their initial disease that doctors know from the outset that other options won’t work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The surgery, which can take over 12 hours across two stages, is rare and performed by only a handful of specialists worldwide. But for people who qualify, success can mean regaining nearly normal vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world,” Moloney said. “It’s highly emotional for us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman’s tooth was extracted in February, and the structure was placed into his eye in June. His last surgery, which straightened the lens to correct visual distortion, took place August 5.&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Regaining the human connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman was fitted with glasses on August 13 and now has 20/30 vision, meaning he can see details at a distance of 20 feet that a person with perfect vision can see at 30 feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing he saw after his surgery was the skyline from Moloney’s 16th-floor office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting. When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult,” Chapman said. “Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the tooth-in-eye surgery, Chapman was close to giving up hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We definitely didn’t have any more options. The transplants were lasting such a short time, and they were becoming more risky to do surgically,” he said. “Emotionally, even when I would get a new one, I knew it wasn’t going to last. This opened a new door for me and a new chapter in my life. This also provides more stability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman is looking forward to traveling – with Japan being on the top of the list – but he wants to “just see the world and take it all in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman’s favorite sight? His niece and nephew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have a niece and a nephew that are 4 and 2. They’re just so cute and so much fun,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is also a massage therapist and is looking forward to working again. “I’ve had a lot of time off work in the last couple of years with surgeries. I can give back and help people in pain and not make everything about me, and I think psychologically, that’s very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Above all, Chapman said, he is excited to dream again and “to not be limited by the instability of this condition and be able to plan and think ahead.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Before, I would always be afraid to plan because I’m afraid I’ll need emergency surgery or have an infection. It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having “human connection again visually” is something that people take for granted but is very powerful for people with poor vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been with him since he was a teenage boy. He’s waited till he’s 34 to get that,” Moloney said. “We’ve all waited a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNcEJON1RBNHEzX1A5YnNncmtqWEZrMTdrV3l5VUtlMnpTTUw0dm1qd3hDZDBWU1h1cmRDUEx4M0E1WWt2cXJzX3lKT1Q2dTFkV3BKQ3JWcEJ6czFsQWFNMmtETmZ5T0ZHREdOdlpONlFFcGdvNDVWcDdFNmFNY3FFSVlPTGozS1lmTHVrVHRiNmZNNzB2bnZXMFdqekpnU1BhbUp5Um5R</guid></item><item><title>饮食改变可能使脑癌更容易治疗，早期研究提示- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/diet-change-could-make-brain-cancer-easier-to-treat-early-study-hints</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

The study ambitiously combined laboratory research and clinical practice by drawing some of its data from tissue taken from the brains of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The study required the collaboration of experts in human and rodent brain surgery, metabolic pathways, and molecular analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol began in the hours before surgery. The patients received an infusion of glucose, which was tagged so that it was detectable by molecular analysis techniques. The glucose flowed through their bloodstreams and into both their healthy and tumorous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fa8651e6-9513-4b3b-9fac-765ab5b921c4"&gt;A common approach for glioblastoma surgery is to remove the tumor and some surrounding brain tissue to minimize the risk of the cancer quickly growing back. The team took blood samples every 30 minutes during surgery and then flash-froze the excised tumor and healthy tissue for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These extracted cells had metabolized the glucose, and the researchers tracked the molecules' path through the cells. In concert with experiments in mice, the researchers gained a clear view into what tumor cells were doing differently as they gobbled up the sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy cells metabolized glucose for cell processes like respiration, in which sugar and oxygen are converted into fuel for the cell. These cells also converted glucose into an amino acid called serine, a key ingredient for important neurotransmitter molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumor cells, by contrast, set these processes aside. Instead, the cancer cells directed glucose to produce nucleotides — the building blocks of DNA. These molecules are vital fuel sources for the tumor cells' endless replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chemoradiation therapies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attack cancer by destroying its DNA, but this rerouting gives the cancer cells a steady source of nucleotides with which to repair the damage. The study showed that the tumor cells also scavenged serine from surrounding tissues to further fuel their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Wahl and his team saw an opportunity. They put mice that had been transplanted with human cancer cells on a feeding regimen that drastically reduced their dietary serine. Lyssiotis suggested that this could potentially be replicated in human cancer patients with a low-protein diet supplemented with serine-free protein shakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this cut the amount of serine available for tumor cells, it forced the cancer to reroute its glucose metabolism back into serine production. In turn, this slashed their nucleotide synthesis and made the cells more vulnerable to chemoradiation. Mice given this treatment combination lived longer than mice that were only given chemoradiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyssiotis explained that this vulnerability would likely work for a limited time, as glioblastoma cells can deftly adapt their metabolisms. In addition, some tumor cells appeared to rely less than others on scavenged serine. "If you can hit that sweet spot, you deprive them of serine, and you come in with the therapies, you get them before they figure out a workaround," he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahl is already beginning work on a follow-up clinical study to back up these results in mice with data from human cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1bb7d81c-d015-4344-80df-48a31070862d"&gt;"We hope to be bringing that to our patients later this year or early next year," he said. That work will also involve challenges and coordination. "Going through cancer treatment is hard. We're asking people to come up for radiation every day, to take chemotherapy. I think asking someone to also follow a prescribed diet could be tricky," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the current study has provided valuable information that will inform that future clinical work. "Part of what we're excited about is that this isotope tracing protocol [tracking the tagged glucose] can tell us which tumors are making serine from glucose and which tumors are taking serine up from the environment," Wahl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyssiotis noted that the paper's pioneering metabolic analysis has identified additional dietary changes that could be explored in future work. Serine modification is the easiest to implement, for the moment. "We think that that's just the tip of the iceberg," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-hZbaR79HnDPoMZdEaRfhML-OGstO55QLSDSwVADF1uxCGtcp8GLAZuZ" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-hZbaR79HnDPoMZdEaRfhML-OGstO55QLSDSwVADF1uxCGtcp8GLAZuZ slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or dietary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Far from universal condemnation, many people expressed support. This was especially true among younger people, with polls showing &lt;a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-poll-young-voters-diverge-from-majority-on-crypto-tiktok-and-ceo-assassination/"&gt;41% of young adults&lt;/a&gt; viewed the murder as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what leads the average person to justify extreme violence? &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000643"&gt;Our recently published research&lt;/a&gt;, in the special issue &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/vio/understanding-violent-extremism"&gt;“Understanding violent extremism”&lt;/a&gt; of the APA &lt;em&gt;Journal Psychology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;, locates the answer in one increasingly widespread phenomenon: workplace burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s &lt;a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; cites “corruption and greed” as a source of frustration, a sentiment that resonates widely amid growing dissatisfaction with modern work environments. &lt;a href="https://clinicalsocialwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cswhi_03_2024_02_butz_OPR_04.pdf"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that broader patterns of systemic frustration and perceived corruption are associated with burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, which took daily surveys from over 600 employees, suggests burnout may quietly fuel worrying attitudes – specifically, the potential justification of violent extremism – towards the perceived source of their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The burnout to extremism pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, employees made daily notes of their burnout symptoms, emotional states, and violent extremist attitudes. On days when employees felt more burnt out, they reported significantly more sympathy toward extremist ideas, such as justifying violence against perceived injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily grind of burnout produced negative feelings of fear, sadness, shame, and guilt. To alleviate these negative feelings – and regain a sense of purpose – some individuals appeared to find extremist ideologies more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon can be explained through the combined lens of three established psychological theories. The first is &lt;a href="https://oxfordre.com/criminology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-249"&gt;General Strain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that daily frustrations lead to violent extremism through the experience of negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315227979-4/burnout-existential-perspective-ayala-pines"&gt;existential model of burnout&lt;/a&gt;, which links burnout to a failed existential quest when meaningfulness in work disappears. Last is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000144"&gt;Significance Quest Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that when the sense of personal significance is eroded in people’s everyday lives, they might look elsewhere, including to radical beliefs, to restore meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, these ideas, particularly the existential and Significance Quest models, suggest that burnout reflects a failed search for meaning – one that may drive individuals toward violent extremism as a means of restoration. General Strain Theory further contributes by emphasising the emotional path involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why burnout matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not suggest that individuals experiencing burnout will inevitably engage in extremist violence. Rather, it demonstrates how everyday experiences of burnout can subtly shift individuals toward violent extremist attitudes, thereby normalising the acceptance of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is critical and is emphasised in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000062"&gt;two-pyramids model&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between radicalisation of opinion and radicalisation of action. While the link between the two may be weak, radicalisation of opinion alone can pose a &lt;a href="https://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/3807"&gt;serious threat to democracies and open societies&lt;/a&gt; by eroding social cohesion and fostering polarisation. For this reason, it warrants focused study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, workplace burnout is alarmingly common, affecting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.vanede.nl/media/2669/gallup-iii-employee-burnout.pdf"&gt;three in four employees&lt;/a&gt;. This means a huge portion of the workforce experiences the emotional strain capable of fuelling extremist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority will never resort to violence, a society that becomes increasingly tolerant of extremist attitudes risks normalising destructive behaviours and undermining both democratic values and workplace cohesion. Moreover, even if only a small minority ultimately engage in violence, the consequences can still be profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organisational support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings also reveal an effective form of protection: &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b6e9be0e81ee13424f7140685a689bd2d85d7d3c"&gt;perceived organisational support&lt;/a&gt;. Employees who felt that their organisations genuinely valued their contributions and cared about their wellbeing were less likely to gravitate toward extremist ideologies, even when experiencing burnout symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a critical caveat to this: organisational support is most effective at mitigating the harmful effects of burnout before negative emotions take hold. Once employees have crossed that emotional threshold, additional support alone has limited power to prevent the escalation toward violent extremist attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers therefore hold the key to addressing burnout before it escalates into something more serious. Organisations must proactively invest in burnout prevention, not merely as a health initiative, but as a vital strategy for preserving stability, both in the workplace and in society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace, ensuring employees feel recognised and valued, training managers to identify early signs of burnout and respond proactively, and establishing open, safe channels for employee feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about fairness don’t stop at the office door. Broader perceptions of injustice in society may also fuel extremist sympathies, especially when individuals are already mentally exhausted. For instance, efforts to pursue the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-luigi-mangione"&gt;death penalty against Mangione to serve President Trump’s political agenda&lt;/a&gt; may deepen perceptions of systemic unfairness, which will only exacerbate radical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more than just workplace exhaustion or disengagement. It signals a deeper and more dangerous existential vulnerability. A workplace that ignores employee burnout doesn’t just risk lower productivity – it creates a breeding ground for ideological radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both workplaces and societies confront a surge in extremist sentiment, including support for violent acts framed as resistance to corporate greed, it is crucial that we learn to recognise the underlying psychological triggers. Burnout is one of them, and employees don’t just need support to do their jobs better – they need it to maintain a sense of meaning, stability, and connection in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burnt-out mind will seek meaning wherever it can find it. If the workplace fails to offer that, extremist ideologies are often ready to fill the void, with consequences that reach far beyond the office walls.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Normal tongues are pale red with a pale white coating. Heart failure patients have a redder tongue with a yellow coating, and the appearance changes as the disease becomes more advanced," study author Dr. Tianhui Yuan, No.1 Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, “Our study found that the composition, quantity and dominant bacteria of the tongue coating differ between heart failure patients and healthy people," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30728915/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has shown that the tongue coating can help distinguish between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy people. The researchers of that study said that it is an early marker to diagnose pancreatic cancer. They said that a microbial imbalance could stimulate inflammation and disease. Inflammation and the immune response also play a role in heart failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study looked at the composition of the tongue microbiome in participants with and without chronic heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 42 patients in a hospital with chronic heart failure and 28 healthy controls. None of them had oral, tongue or dental diseases, suffered an upper respiratory tract infection in the past week, had used antibiotics and immunosuppressants in the past week, or were pregnant or lactating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stainless steel spoons they collected samples from the tongue coating in the morning, prior to the participants even brushed their teeth or had breakfast. They used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify bacteria in the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Zareen Khan Turns To Ancient Fire Cupping To Beat Stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the participants with heart failure shared the same types of microorganisms in their tongue coating. On the other hand, healthy people also shared the same microbes. There was no overlap in bacterial content between the two groups. Five categories of bacteria distinguished heart failure patients from healthy people ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More research is needed, but our results suggest that tongue microbes, which are easy to obtain, could assist with wide-scale screening, diagnosis, and long-term monitoring of heart failure. The underlying mechanisms connecting microorganisms in the tongue coating with heart function deserve further study.,” Dr. Yuan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPdXIycTRROWtBdHB0UmgxcHpyOWh1TjhOSjJubTI4dF92YWpRYU1SZ3pMc0ZvLUVoNEQ0cGNOMmY3b1hoZDhqaFpzZlI4Z2JIZjZxYkwzMVZ6VTVTTDBJbnhhTy1WWURPTzg1UldIMDEzSGlGOGxWajkzX2NmRl9HNDZjSFVNM3M1dWVyYk9lcUxzbjlkMG1sRVVXVk16Q1V3em54OEdhRmZhTzJxOURncWc3Y2hXa3Q5MzQ3enhtdGF6Z3FFbG14LVIyQUFXdVpCQlZyc2xyVWU5bG9KTWc</guid></item><item><title>科学家测试一种真正有效的抗衰老面霜- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205851.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Against the backdrop of high market demand for effective anti-ageing cosmetics, a team of Chinese researchers assessed the clinical effectiveness of a 0.1 % pterostilbene-containing skincare emulsion against a control emulsion over 28 days with 31 participants.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study employed a double-blind, split-face design, comparing the left and right sides of the face and using advanced instruments along with subject self-assessments. The set of instruments used, together with the findings, is reported in the team's published article in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Dermatologic Science and Cosmetic Technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results indicated that the pterostilbene emulsion remarkably improved skin elasticity, firmness, and reduced wrinkles, such as forehead, undereye, and Crow's feet wrinkles, shares co-author Zhiyuan Chen, Founder of Guangzhou Luanying Cosmetics Co., Ltd. "It also increased the thickness of the epidermis layer, enhanced collagen and elastic fibers, and minimized skin pores."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the control emulsion, the pterostilbene emulsion brought about statistically significant improvements, and all subjects expressed higher satisfaction with the pterostilbene emulsion. These results collectively demonstrated the superior anti-aging efficacy of the pterostilbene emulsion through multiple mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to corresponding author Xueping Chen, the findings advance our understanding of pterostilbene's role in skincare by providing evidence of its potent anti-ageing effects and supporting its use as an active ingredient in cosmetics. "It also offers a new perspective on natural compounds' applications in the skincare industry," says Chen. "The significant improvements in various skin parameters and the subjects' positive feedback highlight the effectiveness of pterostilbene, which may change the way we approach anti-ageing skincare formulations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors propose a longer study period to fully understand the impact of pterostilbene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My 72-year-old neighbor just helped me move a couch up three flights of stairs. Afterwards, while I caught my breath, she mentioned she'd already done her morning swim. "I'm slowing down," she said, genuinely believing it. That's when I realized: the people aging best often have no idea they're exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We obsess over wrinkles and gray hair while missing what actually matters. The real markers of healthy aging aren't visible in bathroom mirrors—they're revealed in grocery stores, conversations, and the thousand small negotiations of daily life. These signs have nothing to do with looking younger and everything to do with staying fully alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. You can get up from the floor without using your hands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it: sit cross-legged on the floor, then stand up. No hands, no knees, no furniture assists. Just rise. This simple move, called the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250404-sit-to-stand-the-simple-test-that-reveals-how-youre-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sit-rise test&lt;/a&gt;, predicts longevity better than most medical exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about flexibility or strength alone—it's about coordination, balance, and something researchers call "functional reserve." People who can do this past 50 have maintained the complex integration of systems that most lose gradually, then suddenly. It means your body still works as a unit, not a collection of failing parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. You still change your mind about big things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did your parents last admit they were wrong about something important? Real cognitive flexibility—not just learning new phone apps but actually revising core beliefs—is one of the strongest predictors of healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aging brain's default is to crystallize, to defend positions rather than examine them. If you've changed your stance on something significant in the past year—politics, relationships, career priorities—your brain is maintaining its plasticity. You're not just learning; you're still capable of unlearning, which is infinitely harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Your friends span multiple decades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at who you spend time with. If your social circle includes people 20 years younger and older, you're defeating one of aging's sneakiest threats: generational isolation. Most people unconsciously age-sort themselves, sliding into demographic bubbles that reinforce their obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intergenerational friendships keep you culturally bilingual. You're not trying to be young or accepting being old—you're just being present across the full spectrum of life. The 30-year-old who seeks your advice and the 80-year-old who makes you laugh are both keeping you alive in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. You're still bad at things (on purpose)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did you last feel like a complete beginner? Not frustrated by technology, but actively choosing to be terrible at something new—pottery, languages, pickleball. The willingness to be publicly incompetent is a superpower that most people surrender by 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuroplasticity research&lt;/a&gt; shows that novel challenges create new neural pathways at any age. But here's the kicker: the benefit comes from the struggle, not the mastery. Your brain needs the humiliation of being bad at things. Those who age best never stop volunteering for beginner status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. You sleep through the night without medication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every night, but most nights. No Ambien, no 3 AM anxiety spirals, no revenge bedtime procrastination. Just sleep, the kind that actually repairs your brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about virtue—it's about system integrity. Good sleep past 50 means your &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aah4968" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, hormone levels, and stress responses are still synchronized. While peers pop melatonin and scroll through WebMD at 2 AM, you're getting the cellular renovation that keeps everything else functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. You can hear conversations in restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not perfectly, but you can track dialogue in a noisy room without exhaustion. This isn't just about ear health—it's about something called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8784007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive spare capacity&lt;/a&gt;. Your brain can still filter, process, and comprehend complex audio environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't realize how much aging happens in the spaces between our senses and our processing. When restaurant conversation becomes work, social life shrinks. Those who can still engage in chaotic sound environments maintain connection to the loud, messy, vital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. You're planning something for five years from now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not dreaming, not hoping—actually planning. A trip, a project, a move. Something that assumes you'll be capable and interested in the future. This psychological time horizon, what researchers call "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197455624000558#:~:text=Future%20time%20perspective%20is%20a,that%20are%20difficult%20to%20discuss." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;future time perspective&lt;/a&gt;,"separates thriving from surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people unconsciously shrink their temporal horizons with age, planning months ahead instead of years. But those aging best still plant trees they'll sit under, start books series they'll finish, make plans that assume future vitality. They're not in denial about mortality—they just refuse to rehearse for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret about aging well: it's not defeating time but staying interested in it. Every marker above shares this—engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, connection over isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stair-climbing neighbor doesn't do yoga or drink green juice. She does something more radical: she assumes tomorrow will require her full presence, so she maintains capacity for it. She keeps functional not from vanity but from practical optimism—believing life will keep asking things of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real healthy aging isn't measured by how young you look but how far forward you're still reaching. It's maintaining what gerontologists call "openness to experience"—the opposite of the slow closing that marks decline.&lt;/p&gt;
