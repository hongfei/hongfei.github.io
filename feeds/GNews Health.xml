Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in an &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/movement-medicine-structured-exercise-program-challenge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated 30%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predicted &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; (your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why and how does exercise reduce cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Population studies have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/how-exercise-can-lower-cancer-risk.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long shown&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#how-might-physical-activity-be-linked-to-reduced-risks-of-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:several theories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt; as to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much exercise do people need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What other advice do you have for people who want to begin exercise programs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/health/moderate-physical-activity-cancer-death-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significant benefit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;significant benefit&lt;/a&gt; from even a small amount of physical activity. The best advice I can offer is to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — start with what you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/health/effects-of-sitting-on-mortality-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:need additional exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;need additional exercise&lt;/a&gt; to counter the negative health impacts of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;

            We all know that regular exercise has many benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200043b6mbil13p1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exercise also improves outcomes in patients with cancer, according to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with cancer who participated in a structured exercise program in a randomized-controlled trial lived longer without cancer recurrence and had a lower risk of dying within the trial period compared with people in the control group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200053b6mhrqi7c61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I was curious why and how exercise reduces cancer risk, and what everyone should know about incorporating exercise programs in their lives. To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200073b6m6kz7tf9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why are the results of this study so important?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200083b6mf61ts82t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Previous research suggested that exercise could be beneficial for cancer survivors, but this is the first randomized trial that demonstrates exercise after cancer treatment can reduce recurrence and improve survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200093b6mgef4cjd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers recruited nearly 900 patients from 55 cancer centers across six countries who had been treated for either stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer. Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in an &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/movement-medicine-structured-exercise-program-challenge" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000a3b6mfxpae85w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000b3b6m1w43pjo4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000c3b6mxro3mzdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predicted &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" target="_blank"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; (your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000d3b6m29qoct68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmgmjlf00023b6m6vc1x0zg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000e3b6mu3yin9t2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000f3b6mt6ixi8rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000g3b6m62d181hk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000h3b6mkazkhjsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000i3b6mlv7qf321@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Population studies have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/how-exercise-can-lower-cancer-risk.html" target="_blank"&gt;long shown&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#how-might-physical-activity-be-linked-to-reduced-risks-of-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt; as to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000l3b6melliq8g0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000n3b6m8h5zrtkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/health/moderate-physical-activity-cancer-death-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;significant benefit&lt;/a&gt; from even a small amount of physical activity. The best advice I can offer is to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — start with what you can.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/health/effects-of-sitting-on-mortality-wellness"&gt;need additional exercise&lt;/a&gt; to counter the negative health impacts of sitting.

&lt;p&gt;X-rays of the ankle showed swelling in the soft tissue but without some signs of infection. The doctors wondered if the man had osteomyelitis, an infection in the bone, which can be a complication in people with diabetic ulcers. The large size and duration of the ulcer matched with a bone infection, as well as some elevated inflammatory markers he had on his blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the bone infection further, they admitted the man to the hospital and ordered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). But the MRI showed only a soft-tissue defect and a normal bone, ruling out a bone infection. Another MRI was done with a contrast agent. That showed that the man's large arteries were normal and there were no large blood clots deep in his veins—which is sometimes linked to prolonged standing, as the man did at his laundromat job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the doctors were still working to root out the cause, they had started him on a heavy-duty regimen of antibiotics. This was done with the assumption that on top of whatever caused the ulcer, there was now also a potentially aggressive secondary infection—one not knocked out by the previous round of antibiotics the man had been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bunch of diagnostic dead ends piling up, the doctors broadened their view of possibilities, newly considering cancers, rare inflammatory conditions, and less common conditions affecting small blood vessels (as the MRI has shown the larger vessels were normal). This led them to the possibility of a Martorell's ulcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ulcers, first described in 1945 by a Spanish doctor named Fernando Martorell, form when prolonged, uncontrolled high blood pressure causes the teeny arteries below the skin to stiffen and narrow, which blocks the blood supply, leading to tissue death and then ulcers. The ulcers in these cases tend to start as red blisters and evolve to frank ulcers. They are excruciatingly painful. And they tend to form on the lower legs, often over the Achilles’ tendon, though it's unclear why this location is common.&lt;/p&gt;

Most children younger than age 5, however, have no symptoms, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Hepatitis B … causes inflammation in the liver …and that inflammation leads to the liver not working well at all," Chin-Hong said.

Depending on the vaccine brand, the hepatitis B vaccine is either a series of two or three shots, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/vaccination/index.html#cdc_generic_section_2-why-vaccination-is-important" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;childhood immunization schedule&lt;/a&gt; recommends babies be vaccinated at birth with a second dose between one and two months old and a potential third dose from 6 months to 15 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The more shots you get, the higher the chance the vaccine will take," Chin-Hong said. "If you get three shots, it's above 97% efficacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 1991, when the ACIP &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommended universal vaccination for hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; among infants to decrease transmission, there were 18,000 cases of hepatitis B in those under 10 years old in the U.S., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since then, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's very, very rare," Chin-Hong said. "So, we've had a big success, and the United States is a mirror for the rest of the world … 97% of countries now have a recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination in infants.

"They're through smaller bits of the virus instead of the whole virus itself or bacteria.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1spf002r35778ebbhab5@published"&gt;I have been dating my lovely partner “B” for six months. They haven’t met any of my friends yet: scheduling is a nightmare, we live an awkward distance apart, and college takes up basically all of our energy. I am working on organizing a get-together eventually, though not now. Complicating things, B is currently going through a severe depressive episode.&lt;br&gt;They have a mental health team, but it’s been difficult. I guess I’m asking a) how much can I share with my friends and b) if it’s imperative to ask how much I can share, how do I phrase that information request delicately?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1ss9002s3577r0d1wcvr@published"&gt;On one hand, I feel like protecting privacy should come first, so I’ve basically just told my friends that B’s busy and had some mental health stuff going on in the vaguest terms. On the other hand, my therapist suggested I utilize my support network more since this has been really hard on me too (not more so than B, of course). Because my friends haven’t even met B, I feel like not only would this be sharing information that’s not mine to share, it’s also messing with first impressions before they’ve even all met. I’m also afraid that asking B about how much stuff I can share on how they’re doing with my friends will send them into a bad spiral about how their illness is affecting me and I should leave them (this has happened a couple times), as well as make them feel awkward around my friends when we finally make the time to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1sut002t3577kqa3rzvz@published"&gt;Again, B does have professional help, but things have just been really awful lately and nothing seems to be working. I love this person and want them to be well. I know they want to be well, too. We are trying our best. Please advise!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1sz0002u3577nyp3g428@published"&gt;—What to Say?&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmjza1k003nvcm6dpoqlfpv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée Desmond-Harris&lt;/strong&gt;: I admire this letter writer for trying to do the right thing here, because I wouldn’t even think about it. After just six months with someone who may or may not last another six months, I’m telling my friends (who I plan to have forever) everything. I’m not saying that’s right but I do think it’s pretty normal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vx002z3577wdlq2avv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie O’Leary&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow. I also want to commend this LW for her thoughtfulness, because I probably would have already unloaded a lot of this on a friend or two by now. I have been trying to think through this. and I think there is a delicate balance to strike between getting the support that you, LW, genuinely need, and not biasing your friends against a partner they haven’t met.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vx00303577db1yk59c@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve given credit for thoughtfulness, and I’m not going to take it back, but as I reread the letter, what’s jumping out at me is the letter writer’s anxiety about not just the privacy aspect of this, but also a desire to control how it all turns out. She wants to make sure her friends like her partner and that her partner doesn’t get triggered by a conversation about this. And I think my advice about that is that as hard as it is, you have to let it go. Things could go wrong with your relationship or your partner’s mental health for any number of reasons. Or things could work out perfectly too! But you have to kind of let things unfold without being so afraid of making a mistake. If your relationship can’t withstand you saying “Just making sure it’s not a secret that you’re dealing with depression, in case it comes up in my life updates to me friends” and if your friends hold a grudge against someone who (hopefully) makes you happy, that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vy00313577m1i2efb8@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: So, as someone who has been both clinically depressed AND dated people who are clinically depressed, I think the LW can talk about this to her friends without asking for permission. Especially since that might set off a spiral (depressed people feel worthless as hell). She doesn’t need to go deep into all her partner’s issues, because that’s not really the point here. The point is that the LW needs support. And so it’s okay to talk about the things in her life that are difficult right now! This is … what friendship is for. I also think that a) we are at a place in society where there is a general understanding that sometimes People Go Through Some Shit, b) LW’s friends are going to form an opinion anyway, and that will fluctuate over time and no one can control that. Check me on this, Jenée, does the LW have to ask for an okay from her partner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz003235778zwwrahc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: The more I think about it, the more I think no. My big reading-between-the-lines conspiracy theory about this one is that the partner is not just depressed but also not treating her very well because of the depression (“This has been really hard on me” could be doing a lot of work). And she is hesitant to share that with her friends because they may legitimately have a bad impression of her partner. So she is—consciously or not—looking for other reasons not to share.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00333577806hqq61@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: Ohhhhhh that is a very interesting reading! You may be right. I guess it’s a question of how much LW needs the support. Because I think someone who is feeling really bad about themselves might not be able to see the request to share as anything other than a referendum on them. So the LW would really need to lean into “this is about me and wanting to talk about my feelings.” And I am not sure how the partner will take that. So, yeah, share, but be discreet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00343577kubzl2q2@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I think she should just organize a brunch and give her life updates and get the support she needs. Maybe it’s “They’ve been depressed and it’s been hard because I care so much about them” or maybe it’s “They’ve been depressed and there are days when that makes them really mean to me and they say they can’t see a future with me because of it.” I mean she doesn’t have to include medication doses and side effects of anything. But if your therapist says to lean on your friends, do it! And don’t edit too heavily when it comes to what exactly has been going on.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thomas Mansfield (left), 29, died of a cardiac arrest in January 2021 within hours of 'necking' a mixture that contained seven times the recommended daily dose of caffeine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The dose he took was the equivalent of up to 200 cups of coffee,' said the FSA in its warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerningly, they added that a survey found less than half of people look for dosage instructions on supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest warning, pharmacist Lauren O'Reilly pointed out that the small print on products often advises &lt;span&gt;'for occasional only'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added: 'People take these all the time and these are so so dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And look you'll see loads of warnings there. So, yeah, these are a massive no from me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, she said eating a banana 30 minutes before your workout will leave you feeling 'plenty of pump'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FSA recommends consuming no more than 400mg each day of caffeine, which is the equivalent to roughly four cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, several lawsuits were launched in the US against fast food joint Panera Bread over the allegedly harmful effect of its highly caffeinated 'Charged Lemonade' drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DailyMail.com found that some health drinks that feature health-related claims on the label, like clean', 'plant-based' and 'natural', have as much as three cups of coffee worth of caffeine, which could be harmful to the three million Americans with long QT syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; A 28 year-old Rhode Island woman took legal action against the chain, alleging the beverage left her with long-term heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lauren Skerritt, an athlete, drank two-and-a-half Charged Lemonades at a Panera location in Greenville, Rhode Island, in April 2022, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After drinking the lemonade, Skerritt allegedly experienced new episodes of palpitations and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans later showed that she was suffering atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It followed the tragic death of a 21-year-old Pennsylvania college student in the US, who according to court documents, suffered a fatal cardiac arrest after consuming the lemonade—which contained 390mg of caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Katz suffered a serious heart rhythm condition called long QT syndrome, which causes the heart to beat irregularly (arrhythmia). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was diagnosed with the condition aged five and had managed it with medication and limiting caffeine, according to documents written by lawyers representing her parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stuart Fischer, an internal medicine physician in New York, told &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12666137/Panera-Bread-charged-lemonade-lawsuit-caffeine-drinks-safety.html"&gt;DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt; that caffeine can eliminate the vital breaks in between heart beats for people with long QT syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients with this condition needs a little bit longer than usual to reboot after the heart muscle has contracted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine, he explains, speeds up the beating pattern, placing too much stress on the already stretched organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If there is too much activity when the muscle needs to relax, it can be potentially fatal or at least a major medical emergency.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Fischer added that just 100mg of caffeine, which is the same as a large cup of coffee, could be enough to trigger a deadly attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:42:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPOF92SzFMOTlGVmk4dkpqUS14Uml1a3dlWEhoWkFUVERUaG5HYUdzU3RtNHNjQmJjWHFlQ2tqUDhTaHVWb3FZVmtDeGlGaWRUZkozWk1ISkN1SEtOWG0weHJpd2F1SFZZUGRtOF83VF9tMllpbmVUUUdDemw0Z2FNQjVXc21UcmNpS2x2T2VGdWVHTlRMdGI3T0pWZ3BaQjlJbVhudi1R0gGrAUFVX3lxTE4wamt1MVFZVW05NjlJU2V6VWYxTXh0ZndqZmZjQmNtVGhOYWVJYk9Na0REUzFvRUZKN0htbnJxR3hQQll6a0RVa1p4TVAyaG9JcVhPNUU4NUJzdFkwZTNiRHhSRHlEVE9FbWNkUDBaY1V5dmlvWFNUVkJTenQ2VGFmSG9XSjE4S0t4bkY5amNGcnZMSjFVZElrbUx5OUhqWnh5LWJ2RUptaURmcw</guid></item><item><title>“我妈妈差点死于这种疾病” ： 21种可能比你想象的更严重的常见疾病-雅虎 | "My Mom Almost Died From It": 21 Common Medical Conditions That Can Be Much, Much More Serious Than You Think - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1CNVJtY2k5MVJYM1BkbDR6N3dxUFJIYUNfdm9Qc1pHZGt4Z2lSQXdjRjlEbGh6aGVIZHJGNjl1MFdNUjFsVVUyY2RpTHlYRERGZWxnT2tLWHVTbl9qY3VLTjZrZ0RySVBldnZ0NFRaaTJyUjZpanc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to our health, sometimes seemingly small things can have big consequences.

It's definitely commonly recognized and treated, but I don't think most non-ADHD people truly understand how frustrating it is to live with it. Your whole life revolves around it, because unless you're always keeping it in check, you can't live in normal society, and it's fucking exhausting having to always be hyper aware of everything you do. Your productivity, your memory, your sensory perception, all of that, is, by default, hindered permanently compared to a neurotypical person, but unfortunately, most things are built around neurotypical capabilities (working 9-5, etc.), and it's so mentally draining to force yourself to adapt to that culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Meds and good habits help, but they can only do so much. No matter what you do or take, you will sooner or later fall into a cycle of procrastination, of forgetfulness, of 'ADHD paralysis,' of sensory overstimulation, and it fucking sucks because it's so difficult to explain to people. It's become so normalized that most people, at least the ones I've talked to, think you're overplaying it or that it's not that big of a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1lm7onn/what_is_a_medical_condition_that_is_more_serious/n07acsx/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frysken;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Frysken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;21.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, "Impacted wisdom teeth. I almost died from mine. One day, I woke up with a toothache and went to the ER. They sent me home, said you have a toothache, go see a dentist. The next day, it was swollen, and the pain was worse, so I went to a different ER. They gave me painkillers and told me to go see a dentist. The next day, I woke up, and my eye was swollen shut."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"My throat was swollen, and I had trouble breathing. Went to a third ER where they told me I had an abscess from impacted wisdom teeth, and the swelling was very close to my brain. If I had waited another hour, I'd be dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So I went from a minor toothache to almost dead in about three days.

However, when high doses of acetaminophen are taken, or if glutathione levels are low from factors like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-aa5e1f00-5784-11f0-8c41-85aceef8cdd2"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; use or malnutrition, the liver's capacity to process and eliminate NAPQI becomes overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When NAPQI is not properly detoxified, it can accumulate in the liver and bind to essential cellular proteins, leading to cell injury and potentially liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top doctor has warned how a common medication could cause lasting damage in the long-term, with organ failure and dementia being among the side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Melillo says the risk of liver damage increases significantly when the dose of acetaminophen exceeds 4,000mg daily in adults. This equates to more than eight Tylenol PM pills. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He highlights that acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines, not just Tylenol PM, so he recommends checking to see which products contain it and the quantities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn't recommend against acetaminophen completely but says it should be used sparingly and not habitually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says the prevalence of it is one of the reasons why there is so much liver damage in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver disease in some form affects one in three Americans, adding up to 100million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because there's no data showing that taking more than 325 mg per dosage unit provides additional benefit while outweighing the increased risk of liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the recommendations, each Tylenol PM tablet contains 500 mg of acetaminophen to relieve pain and 25 mg diphenhydramine to help you go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research also found that acetaminophen could &lt;span&gt;alter the perception of risk by making certain activities seem less dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study ingested two acetaminophen tablets (1,000 mg) of the drug or a placebo and were asked to rate certain activities based on risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those under the influence of the of the drug rated activities like bungee jumping, skydiving or starting a new career in your mid-30s as less risky than those who took the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2020 study, conducted by The Ohio State University, built on previous work that determined acetaminophen impacts the user's psychosis, as it was found to reduce positive and negative emotions, such as hurt feelings, concern of other's suffering and even their own joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo also dislikes Tylenol PM for its other main ingredient, diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an antihistamine, which means it blocks histamine, a chemical in the body that promotes wakefulness, leading to drowsiness and helping with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo says that most people will be more familiar with the medication by its brand name, Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why he isn't a fan of diphenhydramine, he said it could 'possibly cause memory loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is an anticholinergic medication, meaning it blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is essential for memory and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is one of America's top-selling nighttime painkillers and it grosses sales close to $1 billion each year. But Dr Melillo warns that the over-the-counter (OTC) medication designed to provide temporary relief from occasional headaches and minor aches and pains is 'misused' by many patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By blocking its action, diphenhydramine can impair these functions, leading to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that taking an anticholinergic for the equivalent of three years or more on a daily basis was associated with a 54 percent higher dementia risk than taking the same dose for three months or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other side effects of diphenhydramine, Dr Melillo says, include dry mouth and urinary retention (an inability to empty the bladder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says for older patients, these symptoms can prove particularly troublesome as they could trigger other age-related health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If people need help sleeping, the pharmacist advises talking to a doctor about prescription medications that are available instead of turning to Tylenol PM or Benadryl, which they could become dependent upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'If you're someone who takes this on a blue moon, then that's fine, it's not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this should not be your go to medication for sleep every night... because you're gonna want to prevent long term complications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTUx6YzhTWXFITEgwZDM2NWlvb2xsQWdMV1FwZUZzLU9tVHp2aHp1RUEwVUE1SWNCOEhkSDFjOU5aLWtxUUJydmdoT2NWTzE2SXQ3WHNkd1o2SHZDRVF0NW9qdU5MNk5kYldxYkRRUEhabUUzWnp5VW1JaWJ5bjBsZDZBOHFKdkVxc0NQVnpURWtVVDjSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnhaUExEQlYzb0xaU0JRN2hMTFlveWVwcDhiRlotWFhtc3cxLTZ4ZUZmTGptWDI1RkhCWVdUdTN2cURfT2dHOFZpU0pQZnZMeEpaOTNYOUYxTUJhZXhCMk5TWE5pX3ZCWkREX1FIb19qbUZub3NCRGtBb2R0OVBNY1B6NkNDQU8yeEtRRlRSRUNXTl91TFM1MGs</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州麻疹爆发加剧了幼儿园儿童的恐惧-新闻 | Kentucky Measles Outbreak Raises Fear for Kindergarteners - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOQXVOdlA5OFViU2N6Qi0zUndEenprZ1dLQnRwczU4eGZRQ3ZSYTdYSU5yRktSREJGcWFZc3I0eWYyeUctRHFUc1BIRFlQUERrRXZkQTRFdHRybFVEZ3BxdE96d1VYcnFZc1VZUjNfOEtuamRNWlpUcXBlRUkyazVGYi1Cc0N3a1FPdEtrWnIyUlVsUUhoVEFXT05IbGNpelU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A measles outbreak has emerged in central Kentucky. There are four confirmed cases: Three were confirmed in Woodford County before a fourth emerged in nearby Fayette County, per &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/06/30/officials-announce-measles-outbreak-central-kentucky/"&gt;WKYT&lt;/a&gt;. The Kentucky Department of Public Health has also reported a confirmed measles exposure in Jessamine County. Officials say one measles case confirmed in Todd County last week is not related to the outbreak. Kentucky's total measles cases for the year is now at 7. Six cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, with one appearing in an individual with just one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which is 97% effective against preventing infection.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        A dozen US states are experiencing active measles outbreaks, involving three or more related cases. Major outbreaks are occurring in Texas, New Mexico, in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. Texas confirmed three more cases on Tuesday, bringing its total to 753, though fewer than 10 are actively infectious, per the &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/article/e5d928e41fd6b3dc6ade087662d61c5c/kentucky-confirms-measles-outbreak-as-us-nears-its-highest-case-count-in-more-than-30-years.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. New Mexico had counted 94 cases as of Friday. Officials in Kentucky are especially concerned because the vaccination rate among kindergartners is below 87%, compared to the national average of 93%, per &lt;a href="https://www.wtvq.com/health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-risk-in-central-kentucky-as-outbreak-grows/"&gt;WTVQ&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky's secretary for Health and Family Services, notes one infected person can spread measles to up to 18 others who are unvaccinated, so "the message is real simple: Get vaccinated."

			&lt;p&gt;Popular weight-loss drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tirzepatide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20534045"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; have revolutionized how we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-strategy-for-weight-loss-outperforms-daily-dieting-study-says"&gt;tackle obesity&lt;/a&gt;. But now, emerging reports about potential side effects have prompted a new investigation by UK health regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people reported experiencing severe &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; problems after taking these drugs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ged0r1n3wo"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government is now asking anyone who's been affected to contact them. They are particularly interested in understanding whether genetic factors may predispose certain individuals to such severe reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always with health alerts, it's crucial to put this news into perspective. There's no clear evidence yet that these drugs are directly &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; pancreas damage. Their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;known side effects&lt;/a&gt; are already well-documented and they remain approved as safe for use when prescribed and overseen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-alternative-ditches-the-needle-and-one-major-side-effect?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ozempic Alternative Ditches The Needle And One Major Side Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that last part – doctor oversight – is vital: it's not safe to obtain these drugs through unofficial channels. Even if you can be sure you're getting what you asked for – which you can't – these medications &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-can-leave-lasting-damage-in-your-mouth"&gt;aren't right for everyone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-covid-vaccine-study-ever-reveals-the-actual-health-risks-you-face"&gt;any medication is taken up by a large number of people&lt;/a&gt;, it will inevitably reach some who will experience health issues regardless of the drugs they're on, and rare adverse reactions will likely also occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sheer number of reports of acute or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"&gt;chronic pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt; warrants further examination, and the cases so far involve up to 10 fatalities. The investigation is being managed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and Genomics England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the drugs being looked at are known as GPL-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;) receptor agonists, because they target cells in the body usually activated by the natural GLP-1 hormone, which controls blood sugar and appetite – hence why they're used for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166145" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan.jpg" alt="Pancreas organ" class="wp-image-166145 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166145" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues have been reported with pancreas conditions. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications can be split into two types: those based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (such as Ozempic and Wegovy), and those based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide"&gt;tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; (including Mounjaro and Zepbound). The latter type also targets &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide"&gt;glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide&lt;/a&gt; (GIP) receptors, as well as GLP-1 receptors, for a stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, almost 400 reports of acute pancreatitis have been received from people using GLP-1 drugs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic, and liraglutide, as per &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/weight-loss-diabetes-jab-users-report-pancreas-problems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly half of those, 181, involve the tirzepatide-based drug sold as Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-genetic-risk-for-disease-can-be-changed-by-your-environment"&gt;Genetic risk&lt;/a&gt; is one of the factors being studied, which may mean some people are more prone to pancreatic issues. In the case of acute or chronic pancreatitis, this manifests itself as severe stomach pain that won't go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the UK aged over 18, who have a strong adverse reaction to one of these weight loss and diabetes drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/if-you-take-a-glp-1-medicine-and-have-been-hospitalised-by-acute-pancreatitis-the-yellow-card-biobank-wants-to-hear-from-you"&gt;are being asked to register&lt;/a&gt; their details on the &lt;a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/"&gt;Yellow Card website&lt;/a&gt; (the official UK system for reporting issues with approved medications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, you'll be asked to submit more information and a saliva sample, if you're chosen to take part in a study of GLP-1 drugs and pancreatic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of all medications have to be considered in relation to other factors, including existing health conditions, genetics, age, and sex. Even the most effective drugs can come &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-most-common-pain-relief-drug-may-induce-risky-behavior-study-finds"&gt;with risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines there can be a risk of serious side effects," &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/if-you-take-a-glp-1-medicine-and-have-been-hospitalised-by-acute-pancreatitis-the-yellow-card-biobank-wants-to-hear-from-you"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Matt Brown from Genomics England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimize these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheers and Jeers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, July 3, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow morning around 8am ET we’ll perform the annual posting of C&amp;amp;J’s &lt;u&gt;first&lt;/u&gt; column, written back on July 4, 1776 to celebrate the birth of our baby Republic that would grow up to eventually swallow itself after ingesting a toxic cocktail of greed, power, citizen apathy, and Pop Rocks. No evening C&amp;amp;J, and we'll be back bright and early on Monday morning. In conclusion: God bless Canada.  —&lt;em&gt;Mgt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;7 days!!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the Numbers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days 'til fall: &lt;strong&gt;81&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days 'til the &lt;a href="https://elsiedairyfestival.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsie Dairy Festival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent of Americans polled by NPR/PBS/Marist who believe that democracy is "under serious threat" here: &lt;strong&gt;76%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odds that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its July 29-30 meeting, according to futures activity, compared with a 19% chance of a quarter-point rate cut: &lt;strong&gt;81%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent chance that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Extreme heat is no longer a rare event , it has become the new normal, no country is immune," according to U.N.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Thursday Molly Ivins Moment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Happy birthday, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;! Ye Olde Fourth of July rolls around again and finds the Great Nation in, frankly, a somewhat pissy mood. Lots of blame game, name-slinging and general unpleasantness. But there's always an upside. The vice president reports that if you go ahead and let fly with the f-word, it makes you feel better. Anything to get that fun Dick Cheney back to his usual sunny self, I always say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned width-md align-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Molly Ivins" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/826634/large/MollyIvins.jpg?1593636143" title="Molly Ivins"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, we seem to have had more halcyon national natal days, but if we ignore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Iraq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the weekend, we should be able to celebrate our national heritage without punching each other in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let's salute all that makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; special, starting with us, the people. Here's to all the musicians from country to hip-hop to rock to classical to jazz to folk to be-bop to &lt;em&gt;norteno&lt;/em&gt; to polka to reggae, and to all the fusion forms thereof. Here's to all the artists who get no respect—the washboard players and lute strummers, harmonica blowers and banjo pickers. Here's to their endless generosity in playing special benefits for retired musicians who are ill and have no health insurance, all over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, every night. And here's to the great Ray Charles, bless his heart. May we all hear his version of "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Beautiful" this holiday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;—July 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppy Pic of the Day: &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jessigrace.bsky.social/post/3lsp434krtc2i" target="_blank"&gt;Tis the season…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS &lt;/strong&gt;to taking out the trash. Hey, everybody! Here's something that's as rare as a functioning MAGA brain cell: actual &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; abortion news. We take you now to Wisconsin where, if recent elections for justices on the state's highest court had swung a different way, we wouldn’t be reading this right now. But they didn't, so…&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-states-1849-total-abortion-ban-rcna216300" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Justice Rebecca Bradley listens during the oral arguments at the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019AP559, League of Women Voters v. Tony Evers, at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin Wednesday, May 15, 2019.

&lt;figcaption&gt;MAGA Wisconsin justice Rebecca Bradley has a sad.&lt;br&gt;
And that gives me a happy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 4-3 decision that came down along ideological lines, the court’s liberal majority affirmed a lower court ruling that overturned the 176-year-old ban and left in place a more recent law in Wisconsin allowing most abortions until about the 20th week of pregnancy. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a win for abortion rights activists in the battleground state, where Democrats had put the issue at the forefront of many elections—including two races in 2023 and 2025 that recalibrated the state Supreme Court's ideological balance—in the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the good news, Wisconsin will now send everyone in the country a large chunk of their delicious cheddar cheese absolutely free. (But you'll have to buy your own crackers and summer sausage. Budget cuts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to idle hands. The dream of our illustrious commerce secretary Crack T. Whip to produce a thriving economy based on an army of middle class Americans screwing tiny screws into tiny screw holes in tiny iPhones 14 hours a day remains a "work" in progress. (See what I did there?) But he might want to step it up if today's employment report from the newly-named Federal Bureau Of Get To Work You Lazy Slackers matches &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what dropped in our laps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yesterday:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy as investors believe. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in June, the ADP report showed, the first decrease since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to ADP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Today's government report drops at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:30 ET&lt;/span&gt;. Fearless prediction: the biggest gains will be in the previously-underperforming "American Concentration Camp Alligator Poop Scooper" sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to Men and women in Black.  The now-hapless Secret Service (America eventually ruins everything) went to work this week in 1865.  Its original intent was to prevent the spread of counterfeit currency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until after the McKinley assassination that the service began protecting the president.  Which reminds me: if you ever want to intimidate someone, just stare at them while talking into your wrist.  (The old lady across the street is now poppin' Prozac like candy...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to greenbacks. In a famous first, during this week in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1785&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Congress agreed that the dollar would officially become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s first “unit of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;currency.” Also during this week in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1785&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the American public agreed that the dollar would, in their households, officially become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s first "endangered species."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to today's edition of &lt;em&gt;Oops, Did We Do Thaaat???&lt;/em&gt;  Take a bow, boycotters. You have effectively rocked a very evil man back on his hooves. Via &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tesla-sales-fell-13-months-anti-musk-sentiment-123409243" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABC News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sales of Tesla electric cars fell 13% in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away, a significant development given expectations that anger with the company's billionaire CEO would have faded by now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plunging sales add to growing signs that Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Europe&lt;/span&gt; has had a deep and enduring hit to the Tesla’s brand appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been today's edition of &lt;em&gt;Oops, Did We Do Thaaat???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten years ago in C&amp;amp;J: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 3, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to getting a second opinion.  The Commerce Department now says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that the first-quarter Gross Domestic Product fell far less (0.2% vs. 0.7%) than originally estimated, thanks to stronger numbers on consumer spending and exports.  But looking ahead, the financial experts all agree on one thing: the fate of this quarter is completely in your hands, lemonade stand kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And just one more…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to blowing this popsicle stand. Every time you go outside on a clear night you’re doing yourself a grave disservice if you don’t look up and gasp as you realize that the universe up there is pretty spectacular. The elves at NASA are also aware of this, so they always let us in on the big celestial events for the month. Here’s a look at July’s skywatching tips, including hot planet-on-planet action and the eagle’s awe-inspiring wingspan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="AlignRight"&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if there are any benevolent societies out there in the cosmos reading this who are good at solving problems on planets inhabited by self-immolating halfwits:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Help!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a nice Thursday. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today's Shameless C&amp;amp;J Testimonial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make the &lt;em&gt;Cheers and &lt;/em&gt;Jeers kiddie pool swimmable. And we will do it together."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            After trying to conceive for 18 years, one couple is now pregnant with their first child thanks to the power of artificial intelligence.

            The couple had undergone several rounds of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, visiting fertility centers around the world in the hopes of having a baby.

            The IVF process involves removing a woman’s egg and combining it with sperm in a laboratory to create an embryo, which is then implanted in the womb.

            But for this couple, the IVF attempts were unsuccessful due to azoospermia, a rare condition in which no measurable sperm are present in the male partner’s semen, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK578191/" target="_blank"&gt;male infertility&lt;/a&gt;. A typical semen sample contains hundreds of millions of sperm, but men with azoospermia have such low counts that no sperm cells can be found, even after hours of meticulous searching under a microscope.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000l3b6n3lvqcy8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So the couple, who wish to remain anonymous to protect their privacy, went to the Columbia University Fertility Center to try a novel approach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdnudj00013b6m68o4dsgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s called the STAR method, and it uses AI to help identify and recover hidden sperm in men who once thought they had no sperm at all. All the husband had to do was leave a semen sample with the medical team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbx31v000i3b6n338hjj9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We kept our hopes to a minimum after so many disappointments,” the wife said in an emailed statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000m3b6nphdol06y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers at the fertility center analyzed the semen sample with the AI system. Three hidden sperm were found, recovered and used to fertilize the wife’s eggs via IVF, and she became the first successful pregnancy enabled by the STAR method.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcme7brl00003b6n519tsg40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The baby is due in December.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000p3b6ne6bxhskd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It took me two days to believe I was actually pregnant,” she said. “I still wake up in the morning and can’t believe if this is true or not. I still don’t believe I am pregnant until I see the scans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdkgvw00003b6makwzv38y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial intelligence has advanced the field of fertility care in the United States: More medical facilities are using AI to help assess egg quality or screen for healthy embryos when patients are undergoing IVF. There’s still more research and testing needed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but AI may now be making advancements in male infertility, in particular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00053b6nbppfof31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zev Williams, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/profile/s-z-williams-md" target="_blank"&gt;Columbia University Fertility Center&lt;/a&gt;, and his colleagues spent five years developing the STAR method to help detect and recover&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sperm in semen samples from people who had azoospermia.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmcocek001g3b6nb5iw4wtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They were struck by the system’s results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00063b6n53a8t9tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A patient provided a sample, and highly skilled technicians looked for two days through that sample to try to find sperm. They didn’t find any. We brought it to the AI-based STAR System. In one hour, it found 44 sperm. So right then, we realized, ‘Wow, this is really a game-changer. This is going to make such a big difference for patients,’ ” said Williams, who led the research team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00073b6n5b0i8yv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a semen sample is placed on a specially designed chip under a microscope, the STAR system – which stands for Sperm Tracking and Recovery – connects to the microscope through a high-speed camera and high-powered imaging technology to scan the sample, taking more than 8 million images in under an hour to find what it has been trained to identify as a sperm cell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdwait000a3b6m9d9vwgat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The system instantly isolates that sperm cell into a tiny droplet of media, allowing embryologists to recover cells that they may never have been able&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to find or identify with their own eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000a3b6nr2rsfwqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s like searching for a needle scattered across a thousand haystacks, completing the search in under an hour and doing it so gently, without any harmful lasers or stains, that the sperm can still be used to fertilize an egg,” Williams said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000b3b6neqpgfn97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What’s remarkable is that instead of the usual [200 million] to 300 million sperm in a typical sample, these patients may have just two or three. Not 2 [million] or 3 million, literally two or three,” he said. “But with the precision of the STAR system and the expertise of our embryologists, even those few can be used to successfully fertilize an egg.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3z7z2001h3b6nobm6mw1c@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="shocking-and-unexpected-diagnosis" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        ‘Shocking and unexpected diagnosis’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000c3b6njwx4o87g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that the male partner accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562258/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 40% of all infertility cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8304267/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 10% of men with infertility&lt;/a&gt; are azoospermic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000d3b6n566ixjxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This often is a really heartbreaking and shocking and unexpected diagnosis,” Williams said. “Most men who have azoospermia feel completely healthy and normal. There’s no impairment of their sexual function, and the semen looks normal, too. The difference is that when you look at it under a microscope, instead of seeing literally hundreds of millions of sperm swimming, you just see cell debris and fragments but no sperm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000e3b6n2kkpl6pw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatment options for azoospermia traditionally have included uncomfortable surgery to retrieve sperm directly from a patient’s testes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000f3b6n1f32g6kj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A part of the testes gets removed and broken into little pieces, and you try to find sperm there,” Williams said. “It’s invasive. You can only do it a couple of times before there could be permanent scarring and damage to the testes, and it’s painful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000g3b6nlayijq6r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other treatment options may include prescription hormone medications – but that will be effective only if the person has an imbalance of hormones. If no other treatment options are successful, couples may use donor sperm to have a child.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000h3b6nfazdmddn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Williams said the STAR method can be a new option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000r3b6nzmr8x1iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really was a team effort to develop this, and that’s what really drove and motivated everybody, the fact that you can now help couples who otherwise couldn’t have that opportunity,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmd0ojx001k3b6nboa02uji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the method is currently available only at the Columbia University Fertility Center, Williams and his colleagues want to publish their work and share it with other fertility centers. Using the STAR method to find, isolate and freeze sperm for a patient would cost a little under $3,000 total, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000s3b6n77914d6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Infertility is unique in a way in that it’s such an ancient part of the human experience. It’s literally biblical. It’s something we’ve had to contend with through all of human history,” he said. “It’s amazing to think that the most advanced technologies that we currently have are being used to solve this really ancient problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000u3b6nqagmocpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not the first time doctors have turned to AI to help men with azoospermia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000v3b6nb4j8uy2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate &lt;a href="https://www.med.ubc.ca/news/could-ai-and-lab-grown-sperm-solve-male-infertility/" target="_blank"&gt;research team in Canada built an AI model&lt;/a&gt; that could automate and accelerate the process of searching for rare sperm in samples from men with the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000w3b6nvrjhuvqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason AI is so well-suited for this is AI really relies on learning – showing it an image of what a sperm looks like, what the shape is, what characteristics it should have – and then being able to use that learning algorithm to help identify that specific image that you’re looking for,” said Dr. Sevann Helo, a urologist at Mayo Clinic with specialty interest in male infertility and male sexual dysfunction, who was not involved in the STAR method or the research in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000x3b6n6g3k9zc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very exciting,” she said. “AI, in general, at least in the medical community, I think is a whole new landscape and really will revolutionize the way we look at a lot of problems in medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000y3b6nreexycws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The STAR method is a novel approach to identifying sperm, but AI has been used in many other ways within fertility medicine too, said Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a San Francisco-based reproductive endocrinologist and host of the podcast “The Egg Whisperer Show.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000z3b6nhoja2dm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is helping us see what our eyes can’t,” Eyvazzadeh, who was not involved in the development of STAR, wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmd8au2001n3b6n70uul4j5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, AI algorithms, such as one called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36543475/" target="_blank"&gt;Stork-A&lt;/a&gt;, have been used to analyze early-stage embryos and predict with “surprising accuracy” which ones are likely to be healthy. Another AI tool, &lt;a href="https://fairtility.com/chloe-oq-for-egg-freezing/" target="_blank"&gt;CHLOE&lt;/a&gt;, can assess the quality of a woman’s eggs before she may freeze them for future use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00103b6nwywzue4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is being used to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-69165-1)&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7C57301b9705d140e3eea608ddb863de2d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638869461590674962%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=WfIPNAt%2BkdC3VLsu8oCloN1BLlfIetvapZnKGcDGRI8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;personalize IVF medication protocols&lt;/a&gt;, making cycles more efficient and less of a guessing game. It’s also helping with sperm selection, identifying the healthiest sperm even in difficult samples. And AI can now even predict IVF success rates with more precision than ever before, using massive data sets to give patients personalized guidance,” Eyvazzadeh said. “The common thread? Better decisions, more confidence, and a more compassionate experience for patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00113b6nosmdqou5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new STAR system is “a game-changer,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00123b6nbahldhut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI isn’t creating sperm – it’s helping us find the rare, viable ones that are already there but nearly invisible,” she said. “It’s a breakthrough not because it replaces human expertise, but because it amplifies it – and that’s the future of fertility care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00133b6n259x5wq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there is also a growing concern that the rushed application of AI in reproductive medicine could give false hope to patients, said Dr. Gianpiero Palermo, professor of embryology and director of andrology and assisted fertilization at Weill Cornell Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00143b6n7vkza32k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is gaining a lot of traction nowadays to offer unbiased evaluation on embryos by looking at embryo morphology,” Palermo said in an email. “However, current available models are still somewhat inconsistent and require additional validation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00153b6nlg6c7r0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Palermo said the STAR approach needs to be validated and would still require human embryologists to pick up sperm and inject them into an egg to create an embryo for patients undergoing IVF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm5nlno00003b6mtrtqj5v0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Maybe the AI addition may help to retrieve the spermatozoon a little faster and maybe one more than the embryologist,” said Palermo, who was not involved in the development of STAR but was the first to describe the method of injecting sperm directly into an egg. Since he &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/gianpiero-palermo-md" target="_blank"&gt;pioneered that method&lt;/a&gt;, it has become the most-utilized assisted reproductive technology in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00163b6nmy8typeo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In my opinion, this approach is faulty because inevitably some men will have no spermatozoa,” Palermo said of the STAR method, “doesn’t matter how their specimens are screened whether by humans or a machine.”

Alcohol-related deaths generally, which include myriad other causes besides liver problems, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/10/wisconsins-alcohol-related-deaths-more-than-tripled-since-1999/77575822007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;increased three-fold in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; between 1999 and 2020, a January analysis from the Journal Sentinel found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But experts say multidisciplinary treatment, reduced stigma around alcohol use disorder, and a renewed emphasis on education and prevention could improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think the narrative often in Wisconsin is just, 'Oh, we're just big drinkers,' and that's all there is," said Maureen Busalacchi, director of the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the Medical College of Wisconsin. "The message is not that you can't drink at all. It's more, really think about it, and just drink less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How does excessive alcohol consumption affect the liver?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for alcohol urge people of drinking age to limit consumption to one drink or fewer per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When people consume significant amounts of alcohol over a prolonged period of time, fat begins to turn up in the liver, and then scar tissue, which can lead to cirrhosis, said Dr. Rita German, a transplant hepatologist at UW Health in Madison. Many times, German said, liver disease symptoms such as jaundice, fever and confusion don't show themselves until the disease has progressed, making it harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What does the data show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nearly 3,000 Wisconsinites died from alcohol-related liver diseases from 2019 to 2023, CDC data show. The large majority — 2,072 — were from cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Deaths from most types of liver diseases due to alcohol consumption increased in those years, including alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatic failure in addition to cirrhosis. Deaths from alcoholic hepatitis fell slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi called the numbers a huge concern. Most of these deaths are preventable, she contended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why are these diseases showing up in younger adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors used to think of alcohol-related liver diseases as affecting people past middle age, German said. But increasingly, that age is dropping. At UW Health's &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/locations/digestive-health-center-254/digestive-health-center-alcohol-related-liver-disease-and-alcohol-use-disorder-clinic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;multidisciplinary clinic&lt;/a&gt; for patients with such diseases, she said, the average age is now 45, and she's treated some as young as 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That may seem to conflict with recent research showing young people, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-gen-z-is-drinking-less" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;particularly Gen Z, drinking less&lt;/a&gt;. But while some are cutting back, those who do drink are drinking more heavily, Busalacchi said. And while alcohol use among Wisconsin high schoolers has generally decreased in recent years, more than one in 10 reported binge drinking in the last 30 days on the state's &lt;a href="https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/sspw/pdf/WI_2023_YRBS_Summary.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey, done in 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The JAMA study noted, in particular, increases in alcohol-related liver disease deaths among adults ages 25-44. Deaths among women also increased disproportionately. Women absorb more alcohol into their bloodstream because they're generally smaller than men and because women's bodies have &lt;a href="https://adp.sa.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2021-05/alcohol_-_genderdifferences.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;less gastric alcohol dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt;, the enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the stomach, German said. Thus, they're at greater risk for liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Medical College of Wisconsin's liver transplant team reports younger and younger women needing transplants due to alcohol consumption, Busalacchi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How could Wisconsin turn the tide?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To catch alcohol-related liver diseases earlier, German said, it's critical that patients be forthcoming about their alcohol use at the doctor's office. And for that to happen, she said, doctors must view alcohol use disorder for what it is — a disease, not a personal failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are concerned about their alcohol consumption may also request an ultrasound of their liver, German said. From there, they can begin treatment if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She also sees the benefits in treatment that is comprehensive. At UW Health's clinic, patients not only see doctors like German who attend to the liver, but addiction specialists and counselors to treat underlying mental health conditions that can drive alcohol use. The clinic has treated between 250 and 300 people since it began in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If it's caught in time, fat and scarring in the liver can be reversed by abstaining from alcohol, German said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi's work continues to focus on changing societal perceptions on drinking culture. She sees encouraging signs around the state from communities that are offering more education about the consequences of excessive drinking, especially for youth. Some are taking a harder stance on age compliance checks for alcohol sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madeline Heim covers health and the environment for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Contact her at 920-996-7266 or &lt;a href="mailto:mheim@gannett.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mheim@gannett.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 10:03:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxObEQ4SmpOMFlGOUU2OWlxeUtfSkRiUmhjZmNxbzFkRlBMaWV4bXgwRzRlWUVCX2lIWEgzRjJxV2tUamprZTg0bl9Od2Z0ZU1JYjJqay1pVDZwT0cwUkNQSk1ob3QwME5SNEE3UzA4NlZHUEV4d2k2dGk5aFRPQUR6T2EtSl84ZkNMZlFjQXlIWHBYY1BhSS1wOUhITjZ1Rm14dlc5R3E5TmY4TDR3cmxmcUl1ejBTSThKbHZUel9PdVROZlk</guid></item><item><title>饮酒对老年人的影响-《纽约时报》 | How Drinking Alcohol Affects You in Older Age - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5YcU83eWQ0S0xWZENoMVpkaUNpY2F4d2lBRGo1VEJycnBPbEJWSG1MdEc1QWNvYjVkWHlaV1lWblJsVHpPSjJCbUo0bnNMeC03NVZSeTRnT1JFYmo0TGRab01Jbmh0X2hHZTBaMmhNbkt1NDJMUEtv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 09:00:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5YcU83eWQ0S0xWZENoMVpkaUNpY2F4d2lBRGo1VEJycnBPbEJWSG1MdEc1QWNvYjVkWHlaV1lWblJsVHpPSjJCbUo0bnNMeC03NVZSeTRnT1JFYmo0TGRab01Jbmh0X2hHZTBaMmhNbkt1NDJMUEtv</guid></item><item><title>您是葡萄糖“勺子”吗？以下是如何修复高血糖和低血糖的方法- NPR | Are you a glucose 'dipper'?

   &lt;p&gt;By all measurements, Judy Freeman, age 76, is in fantastic health. She doesn't have diabetes or heart disease. She's not overweight. She stays active.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I try to walk at least four or five times a week," says Freeman, who's a well-known potter in Alpine, Texas. "I also work about 20 hours in the studio." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in the past year or so, Freeman hasn't felt like herself. She's been more tired and sluggish. And she has had more trouble shedding a little extra weight. "I try and I can't lose it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Freeman decided to experiment with a new technology for a few weeks: a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5418465/blood-sugar-glucose-monitor-metabolic-health" target="_blank"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's a small patch that inserts a needle into your skin. The device estimates your blood sugar every few minutes and sends the value to an app on your phone. You can track how various foods you eat alter your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Freeman wondered if the extra information about her blood sugar might give her insight into why she felt so sluggish and stuck in her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-75283" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;On the first day, she uncovered a big clue: About two hours after lunch, her blood sugar nosedived below her baseline levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Dips trigger overeating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363342/" target="_blank"&gt;have shown conclusively&lt;/a&gt; that these monitors greatly help&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6712232/" target="_blank"&gt; people manage diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;the first continuous glucose monitors for people without diabetes. Now, two companies, Dexcom and Abbott, sell and market the devices to anyone who wants to track their blood sugar. They cost about $50 and last for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But scientists are still trying to figure out if — and how — these monitors could help people without diabetes. Can the data motivate people to eat a healthier diet by helping them learn how food affects their bodies?&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of the scientists leading this effort is &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sarah-berry" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Berry, a nutritionist &lt;/a&gt;at King's College London. She's also chief scientist at the &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-us" target="_blank"&gt;company Zoe&lt;/a&gt;, which sells personalized nutrition plans that incorporate these devices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford University, Berry and her colleagues led two&lt;a href="https://zoe.com/our-studies" target="_blank"&gt; large studies&lt;/a&gt; in which thousands of people without diabetes wear continuous glucose monitors while they eat tens of thousands of meals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After analyzing all of their data, Berry says one finding stands out: "A big proportion of people are what we call dippers," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you're a dipper, your blood sugar sometimes acts in a specific way: After eating carbohydrates, it rises quickly, and then about two to three hours later, it sometimes plummets low, below your baseline, or fasting, level.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you'll have this big increase followed by this big crash," Berry says. "Not everyone gets these dips, but we see that quite a high proportion of people do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These dips can trigger overeating, their study found, so it may make it harder to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you are dipping, then you feel &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;more hungry more quickly&lt;/a&gt;, and on average you tend to eat 80 calories more at the next meal and 320 calories more over a whole day," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But eating more wasn't the only problem with dips. Berry's team has found that the sugar crashes also correlated with a person's mood. During a dip, people tended to feel less alert and more fatigued, she and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00383-x" target="_blank"&gt;reported in the journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These conclusions line up with previous studies on people with diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/dalia-perelman" target="_blank"&gt;Dalia Perelman&lt;/a&gt;, who's a research dietitian at Stanford University and wasn't involved in this research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When your blood sugar is high, people tend to be lethargic, fatigued, and thirsty," Perelman says. "You're just like, ugh."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When your blood sugar is low, you're jittery. You can have heart palpitations. And you become super hungry. "Low blood sugar gives your body very strong signals," she says. "You really feel terrible,"  which brings us back to Judy Freeman in Alpine, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first day Freeman wore the glucose monitor, she ate lunch as usual. About two hours later, she started to feel horrible. "I had this really sinking feeling. It was a sort of anxiety or depression. I felt like if I don't get up, I'm just going to stop breathing and die. It was so overpowering," Freeman says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When Freeman glanced at the monitor, she could hardly believe what she saw: "My blood sugar had shot up at some point, and then it plummeted down to the lowest point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This sinking feeling wasn't new to Freeman. She's had it from time to time. "I just never, ever thought it was in any way correlated with what I ate or anything like that.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that your blood sugar may be fluctuating wildly and you want to even things out, here are three things you can try:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Put some clothes on those carbs&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Don't eat meals and snacks that consist mostly of carbohydrates, Perelman says. "Don't eat naked carbs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, eat them with protein and healthy fats. That means oils from vegetables, seeds and nuts, but also fats from fish. So add eggs to breakfast, canned fish for lunch or tofu for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On top of that,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/19/1196977677/easy-ways-to-add-more-fiber-to-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt; add more fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— &lt;em&gt;lots more.&lt;/em&gt; For that, the go-to ingredient is beans, says &lt;a href="https://twu.edu/faculty-profiles/college-of-health-sciences/mindy-a-patterson-phd-rdn/" target="_blank"&gt;nutritionist Mindy Patterson&lt;/a&gt; at the Texas Woman's University. "You really have to eat beans to get enough fiber in your diet," she says. (Chia seeds are another great source of fiber.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Fiber and protein together&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt; put a speed bump &lt;/a&gt;on your digestion," says clinical &lt;a href="https://www.realfood-matters.net/" target="_blank"&gt;nutritionist Karen Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. "They really stabilize your blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Sprinkle the carbs throughout the day&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent dips, you want your gut to slowly drip carbs into your blood, not douse it with a deluge of sugars, Perelman says. So don't eat a bunch of carbohydrates all at one meal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For preventing dips, "it doesn't matter how many carbs you ate throughout the day," she says. "It matters how many carbs you've had at each meal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Pay attention to what you eat first at a meal&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With food, order matters, too. Eat the protein, fiber and fat &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; at a meal and the carbs &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt;, Kennedy says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Say you're having a steak, salad and baked potato for dinner. "If you eat the salad and the steak first, and then the potato, you'll see that you don't have as much of a spike in blood sugar or as much of a drop afterwards," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If your blood sugar keeps a more even keel, then your mood and hunger will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And here's the great part: You don't need to buy a glucose monitor to figure this out, says Sarah Berry at King's College London. Simply pay attention to how you feel about two hours after a meal. If you get moody, anxious or super hungry, you're probably a dipper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Alarming projections by the National Cancer Institute estimate that in 2025 alone, there will be 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer—accounting for 15.4% of all new cancer diagnoses in men—and approximately 35,770 deaths, representing 5.8% of all cancer-related fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures aren’t just numbers, they're a wake-up call. They point up the pressing need to raise awareness, enhance early detection, and prioritise treatment strategies for a disease that begins in the prostate—a small but vital gland in the male reproductive system. As the global burden of prostate cancer continues to rise, understanding its implications is no longer optional as it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is prostate cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prostate is a small but essential gland in the male reproductive system, located just below the bladder and above the pelvic muscles. About the size of a chestnut, it weighs approximately 30 grams and plays a crucial role in producing the fluid that forms a key component of semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer arises when cells grow uncontrollably, disrupting the body’s normal functioning. Prostate cancer, similarly, develops when cells in the prostate gland begin to multiply in an unregulated and abnormal manner, potentially leading to serious health complications if not detected and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="27604823" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-stage-prostate-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;early-stage prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staging of cancer Staging describes or classifies a cancer based on how much cancer there is in the body and where it is when first diagnosed. When prostate cancer cells remain confined to the gland itself—or have only slightly extended beyond it without spreading to distant parts of the body—the condition is referred to as localised prostate cancer. However, once the cancer spreads beyond nearby tissues, it progresses into what's commonly called advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under TNN system given by AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer, Prostate cancer is generally classified into four stages by :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Stage (Stages I &amp;amp; II): The tumor is limited to the prostate and hasn’t spread elsewhere. This is also known as “localized prostate cancer” and is often more responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally Advanced (Stage III): The cancer has begun to grow beyond the prostate, invading nearby tissues such as the seminal vesicles, but has not reached distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced or Metastatic (Stage IV): The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, or lungs. This stage is more challenging to treat and is commonly referred to as advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26911286" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-prostate-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Symptoms of prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;: Warning signs to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, prostate cancer does not provide noticeable symptoms in its early stages.

While medical professionals haven’t deciphered the exact causes behind the same, several risk factors have been identified by them that may increase the potential of developing prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Major Risk Factors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age: Risk of prostate cancer is directly proportional to the age of a man, it rises majorly after age 50. The prostate naturally enlarges with age, increasing vulnerability (American Cancer Society).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family History: According to the American Cancer Society, “Having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk of developing this disease. (The risk is higher for men who have a brother with the disease than for those who have a father with it.) The risk is much higher for men with several affected relatives, particularly if their relatives were young when the cancer was found.” Therefore, a close relative (father, brother, grandfather) with prostate cancer increases one’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inherited Gene Mutations: BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene (both play an important role in DNA repair) changes, often linked to breast and ovarian cancers, can also raise prostate cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity: Obese individuals may face more aggressive forms of prostate cancer and a higher chance of recurrence after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking: In the study on Cigarette smoking and prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies published in National Library of Medicine, Data from observational studies suggest that cigarette smoking has an inverse association with prostate cancer incidence.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a protein-rich diet can have several health benefits. If you struggle to get enough protein to meet your body’s needs, incorporating high-protein foods into snacks can help you reach your protein goal. We spoke with registered dietitians to find out why protein is so important—plus, which high-protein foods should make it into your snack rotation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-eating-protein-rich-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Benefits of Eating Protein-Rich Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is an essential macronutrient that is important for health and well-being. “Protein plays a key role in the body’s ability to build muscle, repair tissue, regulate hormones and perform other cellular functions like metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cayleigh-mckenna-rd-ldn-81b7551a8/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cayleigh McKenna, RD&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition consultant at Houston Family Nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, physically active people should emphasize protein in their meals and snacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding protein to snacks can offer several benefits, including long-lasting energy and increased satiety. “Protein-rich snacks can help you feel fuller for longer, promoting a sense of nourishment and satisfaction,” says &lt;a href="https://www.honesthealthandwellness.com/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andrea Hinojosa, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Honest Health &amp;amp; Wellness. “Many high-protein snacks are also rich in other essential nutrients, contributing to overall health and well-being,” she adds. Eating protein with snacks may also balance blood sugar, improve heart health and reduce cravings later in the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-high-protein-foods-to-eat-as-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Best High-Protein Foods to Eat as Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-greek-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Greek Yogurt  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creamy and refreshing, “Greek yogurt is high in protein and can be easily paired with honey and nuts for added flavor and texture,” says Hinojosa. Depending on the brand, you’ll snag about 20 grams of protein per 7-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
You can also use &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; in place of sour cream and mayonnaise in dip recipes for a high-protein swap that’s lower in saturated fat. Strained Greek-style yogurt is also a great way to add protein to fruit smoothies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One egg provides a satisfying 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They’re portable, easy to prepare and packed with high-quality protein,” says Hinojosa. Enjoy hard-boiled eggs with a handful of nuts or top with hot sauce. Hinojosa also recommends pairing eggs with kimchi to add digestive-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; and a spicy kick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-canned-tuna-or-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Canned Tuna or Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish is a quick high-protein option for snacks. You can even purchase “canned” fish in travel-friendly pouches, making them the perfect protein-rich snack when you’re on the go. Canned salmon has about 18 grams of protein per 3-ounce serving, while canned tuna has about 22 grams per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They also provide omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for heart health and brain function,” adds Hinojosa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267208/tuna-salad-spread/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tuna Salad Spread&lt;/a&gt;, which combines canned tuna and Greek yogurt for a protein-packed snack. Spread it on whole-grain crackers or toast, or use raw veggies for dipping. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-string-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. String Cheese  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another portable and easy option for snacking is string cheese. One stick has about 8 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For high-protein snacks, I love a turkey and cheese roll-up. I use a cheese stick and two slices of deli turkey or chicken and roll it up together. It’s really satisfying,” says &lt;a href="http://linkedin.com/in/katie-d-78a88838" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Katie Drakeford, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Drakeford Consulting. You can also enjoy string cheese with fresh fruit or a side of nuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-jerky"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Jerky &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jerky is a great high-protein snack option—and it’s especially handy if you can’t keep things cold. One serving of beef jerky (about 1 ounce) provides about 10 grams of protein, while turkey jerky has 11 grams per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy jerky with fresh fruit like an apple or banana, or with a handful of trail mix for an added boost of healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Deli turkey is another high-protein snack option. Just one slice of deli turkey has 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy a couple of slices on crackers, layer a few slices with cheese on top of cucumber slices or make a grown-up snack box with turkey, cheese, grapes and crackers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Until it became a social media darling, who knew there were so many ways to incorporate &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8047423/best-cottage-cheese-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; into meals and snacks? And it’s worth it to do so: 1 cup of low-fat cottage cheese has about 24 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A cup of cottage cheese with berries or pineapple is another go-to when looking to up protein intake,” says Drakeford. If you prefer a savory snack, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8078448/cottage-cheese-snack-jar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;Simply using your food packaging in the manner it's supposed to be used is enough to contaminate your comestibles with a sprinkling of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A painstaking review of 103 scientific studies on microplastic food contamination found actions as simple as opening a plastic drink bottle or using a plastic chopping board can shave off tiny particles of common polymers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even glass bottles that use a plastic gasket, plastic-lined pizza boxes, plastic-lined disposable  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="166048" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; cups, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-tea-bag-could-release-billions-of-microplastics-into-the-body"&gt;plastic tea bags&lt;/a&gt;, plastic wrappings, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microwaving-safe-plastics-can-release-billions-of-particles-scientists-warn"&gt;microwaveable plastic containers&lt;/a&gt; shed microplastic like a Persian cat sheds fur in spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, a team led by biologist Lisa Zimmermann of the non-profit Food Packaging Forum in Switzerland says, is ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microplastics Could Accumulate in Our Brains More Than in Kidneys And Livers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first systematic evidence of how normal and intended use of foodstuffs packaged in plastics can be contaminated with micro- and nanoplastics," &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness"&gt;Zimmermann told CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found food packaging is actually a direct source of the micro- and nanoplastics measured in food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more scientists look into micro- and nanoplastics, or MNPs, the more we see just how widespread they have become. These are tiny pieces of material, too small to see, released by a variety of polymers as they're used or break up in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic is ubiquitous in our modern society, providing a cheap, easily manufactured solution to everything from storage to clothing to furnishings. In recent decades it has become clear its resistance to degrading doesn't mean it is impervious to crumbling into smaller fragments, which easily filter through ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found microplastics throughout the human body, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-every-human-placenta-tested-study-finds"&gt;including placentas&lt;/a&gt;. It's been found in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-infiltrate-every-organ-including-brain-study-in-mice-shows"&gt;every major organ in mice&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-absorbed-by-fetus-persist-after-birth-study-in-mice-finds"&gt;their fetuses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this even more worrying is that we just have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxicologists-urge-for-research-into-the-unknown-health-risks-of-microplastic"&gt;very little idea about the health impacts&lt;/a&gt;, although it's not looking promising: A study last year found that cardiac and stroke  patients with a high concentration of microplastics in their carotid artery plaque &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;had a significantly elevated risk of death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmermann and her colleagues examined 103 studies that have investigated the presence of plastic particles in food and food simulants. From these studies, they extracted 600 entries about food contact articles, of which 96 percent reported the presence of MNPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those entries were also compiled into a searchable and filterable &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/resources/databases/mino"&gt;dashboard that anyone can access&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to home in on different types of food contact articles, from packaging to baby bottles, as well as different types of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/glass-bottles-actually-contain-more-microplastics-scientists-find?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glass Bottles Actually Contain More Microplastics, Scientists Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular note, the researchers found, is that multiple studies found that for some reusable plastic items, such as melamine bowls, the amount of microplastics shed increased with each wash. This suggests that repeated heating and abrasion increases the rate at which these items degrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that ultra-processed food contains more microplastic than minimally processed food. The reason for this is simple: more processing steps mean greater exposure to plastic food-processing equipment, resulting in more MNPs in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, the researchers say, strongly indicate that not only is a lot more research warranted, but also that more needs to be done to minimize the use of plastics in food packaging and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that under intended or foreseeable conditions of use, plastic food contact articles can release MNPs into foodstuffs," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3"&gt;they write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contribution of plastic food contact articles to human MNP exposure is currently unclear and warrants further investigation. Further research is also necessary to establish human health impacts associated with MNP exposures, but a precautionary approach aimed at limiting human exposure to MNPs, including from food contact articles, is prudent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/resources/databases/mino"&gt;access the interactive dashboard here&lt;/a&gt;, and the paper has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;npj Science of Food&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Late-night snacks can support weight loss—what matters most is choosing balanced, nutrient-dense options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A top pick is cottage cheese with fruit and nuts, offering protein, fiber, healthy fats, and sleep support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for snacks with under 200 calories, over 7 grams of protein, and fiber to keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292223/these-are-the-worst-foods-to-have-before-going-to-bed/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating before bed&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;no-no&lt;/em&gt; if weight loss is a goal. However, that couldn’t be further from the truth. And, there’s science to prove it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A small snack can benefit cardiovascular and metabolic health, as well as promote muscle protein synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You don’t have to avoid snacking at night. And that advice stands if you’re aiming to lose weight. It's the quality of your snack that matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So when you’re looking for a late-night bite, read on. We talked to registered dietitians about what late night snack they’d choose to support weight loss.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dig into this creamy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-snack-jar-with-fruit-8411316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar with Fruit&lt;/a&gt; when hunger strikes at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you haven’t embraced the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8056073/cottage-cheese-mustard-dip-trend-gone-too-far/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese craze&lt;/a&gt;, here’s your opportunity. The best late-night snack for weight loss that dietitians swear by is the trendy staple that has social media buzzing. This recipe for a cottage cheese snack jar adds diced peaches and chopped pecans for a sweet and crunchy snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cottage cheese and fruit is an amazing and delicious late-night snack,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Nutrition Starring You and author of &lt;em&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. “The slow-digesting protein, fiber from the fruit and unsaturated fats from a sprinkle of nuts is a fabulous combo to help balance blood sugar, feed your muscles while you sleep and provide an antioxidant boost,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s more about why this snack staple is such a superhero before bed.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Sleep-Promoting Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like turkey on Thanksgiving, dairy foods are a great way to up your intake of tryptophan, says registered dietitian and certified personal trainer &lt;a href="https://enjoyfoodenjoylife.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Rodriguez, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid that plays an important role in the production of serotonin and sleep-regulating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-melatonin-8663994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; for sleep. Thanks to this and other amino acids found in dairy, foods like cottage cheese may help support sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy is a powerhouse when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-eat-as-snacks-8674784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it contains a complete package of essential amino acids. A ½-cup serving of 1% fat cottage cheese provides 14 grams of protein for just 80 calories and 1 gram of total fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research shows that pre-sleep protein, specifically casein, can help your body build muscle when you are engaged in a strength training program.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This supports earlier research that suggested that higher-protein diets may also help with appetite and weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Choosing a low-fat dairy food like cottage cheese is a great way to add a solid source of protein into your nighttime routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Vitamins and Minerals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese contains calcium, magnesium, zinc and B vitamins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Magnesium and zinc, in particular, play an important supporting role in helping convert tryptophan in dairy foods into melatonin (that circadian rhythm-regulating good sleep hormone).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One caveat when it comes to cottage cheese is its sodium content. Traditional cottage cheese is rather high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, with a ½-cup serving clocking in at 459 milligrams, 20% of the recommended daily limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are trying to reduce the sodium in your diet, choose a no-salt-added cottage cheese or compare the sodium content between brands and pick a lower-salt product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While cottage cheese on its own lacks fiber, the addition of fruits and nuts gives it a nice fiber boost. This recipe supplies 3 grams of fiber. Plus, when some of that fiber comes from fruit, you’re in luck. “The addition of fruit can satisfy sweet cravings that you may be trying to minimize while pursuing a weight-loss goal,” says Rodriguez.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Fat  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy fat sources contribute to snack satiety and satisfaction, says Rodriguez. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-snack-jar-with-fruit-8411316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar with Fruit&lt;/a&gt; has 2 tablespoons of chopped pecans, though you can change up the nuts if you’d like. Other ideas include slivered almonds, walnut pieces or chopped pistachios.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-late-night-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Consider When Choosing a Late-Night Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacks do not have to involve heading to the pantry to grab potato chips or cookies. (Classic TV munchies, of course.) Those snacks taste good, but there are better choices that align with weight loss. “While I encourage my patients to embrace an ‘all foods fit’ philosophy, nighttime presents its own challenges,” says Rodriguez. For example, eating spicy, fatty or fried foods can cause indigestion, while foods with a lot of added sugars can cause blood glucose spikes. Both of these can disrupt your sleep, and lack of sleep can affect your appetite and may make weight loss more difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But there are two nutrients you should focus on when it comes to nighttime nibbles: protein and fiber, says Harris-Pincus. These provide staying power, she says. “Sticking with these options will help to keep blood sugar levels more stable and offer an opportunity to maximize your nutrient intake for the day.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-food-and-nutrition-philosophy-6746110" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition parameters&lt;/a&gt; to focus on when finding a late-night snack:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for roughly 200 calories per snack, depending on your personal energy needs, to avoid feeling overly full before bed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure your snack choice has protein. Aiming for 7 or more grams provides a good source of protein. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber helps keep you fuller for longer, and can also support your weight-loss goals through offering satiety, meaning you’re less likely to mindlessly munch. Aim for a snack that provides some fiber, ideally 3 or more grams. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Fat is your friend; it also helps to satiate you. Choose a snack that packs a little bit of unsaturated fat to help provide that staying power until your morning meal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can enjoy a late-night snack, even if weight loss is on your radar. Consider your individual calorie, protein and nutrient needs as you explore what foods will satisfy you as well. Dietitians recommend pairing low-fat cottage cheese with fruit and nuts for a late-night option that provides protein, fat and fiber, all nutrients that support weight-loss goals.

from the &lt;a href="https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; reports that a daily dose of omega‑3 fatty acids can shrink aggressive behavior by up to 28 percent. &lt;a href="https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/people/adrian-raine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adrian Raine&lt;/a&gt;, a neurocriminologist at the university, led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-memory-and-fish-oil"&gt;Mood, memory, and fish oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brains run on fat, and two key omega‑3 molecules, eicosapentaenoic acid (&lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Eicosapentaenoic-Acid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) and docosahexaenoic acid (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10776907/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DHA&lt;/a&gt;), slip into cell membranes, helping neurons fire smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low tissue levels of these fats have been tied to mood swings and impulsive violence, while diets rich in cold‑water fish tend to show the opposite pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the body converts plant‑based &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24898228/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alpha‑linolenic acid&lt;/a&gt; to EPA and DHA inefficiently, researchers have wondered whether supplements could fill the gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small trials dating back to the 1990s hinted at behavioral benefits, but sample sizes were too thin to guide policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aggression-and-fish-oil"&gt;Aggression and fish oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raine’s team pored over 28 randomized controlled trials that enrolled 3,918 participates, from children to older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across genders, diagnoses, dosages, and study lengths, the capsules produced a modest but reliable drop in both reactive and premeditated aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the time has come to implement omega‑3 supplementation to reduce aggression,” said Raine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average effect size, about 0.22 on the standardized “g” scale, may sound small, yet public‑health experts note that even tiny behavioral shifts can matter when applied to millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-chemistry-of-calm"&gt;The chemistry of calm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA and DHA dampen production of pro‑inflammatory molecules that sensitize the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-your-brain-makes-a-decision-before-you-know-it/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;’s stress circuits. They also nudge serotonin and dopamine signaling toward a calmer set point, offering a biochemical explanation for the behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the analysis found benefits at doses as low as 250 milligrams of combined EPA and DHA, an amount found in a single soft gel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intakes did not guarantee bigger gains, hinting that individual genetics and baseline diet modulate the response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-omega-imbalance"&gt;The omega imbalance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans don’t get enough &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;long-chain omega‑3s&lt;/a&gt; from food alone. The average U.S. diet is heavy on &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/expert-answers/omega-6/faq-20058172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;omega‑6 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; – often in a 10:1 ratio to omega‑3 – which may fuel inflammation and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend at least two servings of fatty fish a week, such as salmon or sardines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t eat seafood, even a basic supplement may close the gap and improve both physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supplements-that-calm-behavior"&gt;Supplements that calm behavior&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One six‑month &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4336833/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; in 8‑ to 16‑year‑olds reported a 59 percent drop in disruptive conduct that lasted half a year after the study ended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar shifts have shown up in adult parolees and nursing‑home residents, suggesting age is no barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑school cafeterias could offer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fish-like-rainbow-trout-suffer-extreme-pain-when-killed-by-air/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; twice a week, while correctional facilities might issue capsules at intake. Raine notes that such steps are “low cost, low risk,” especially compared with medications or restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond behavior, omega‑3s continue to earn cardiovascular praise. In the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REDUCE‑IT trial&lt;/a&gt;, 4 grams of purified EPA cut fatal heart attacks by 25 percent among statin users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calmer mind and a stronger heart in the same pill has obvious appeal for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fewer-risks-broad-access"&gt;Fewer risks, broad access&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to prescription medications for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamines-role-in-male-aggression-fades-with-fighting-experience/"&gt;aggression&lt;/a&gt;, fish oil has fewer side effects and is easier to access. It doesn’t require a prescription, and many brands are available over the counter at grocery stores or online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, fish oil should not replace professional treatment when serious behavioral issues are involved. It can be a helpful addition, but therapy, structured support, and in some cases medication are still essential tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-room-to-refine-dosing"&gt;Room to refine dosing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega‑3 is “not a magic bullet,” Raine warned, stressing that therapy, education, and social support still matter. Most studies followed volunteers for four months; researchers need longer follow‑ups to see whether tempers stay cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also hope to learn why some volunteers improve more than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetic-supergenes-power-explosive-evolution-in-some-fish/"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; that alter fatty‑acid metabolism, baseline inflammation, and even gut microbiota may shape response. Tailored dosing could push the average benefit beyond today’s modest figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, experts say parents of an irritable child, or adults who catch themselves snapping, might consider swapping a sugary snack for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-young-salmon-break-the-typical-migration-rules-boosting-survival-chances/"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, or adding a budget fish‑oil capsule to breakfast. The risk is tiny, the price is low, and the evidence is getting harder to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-needs-fish-oil-most"&gt;Who needs fish oil most?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone responds the same to omega‑3 fatty acids. Genetic differences, particularly in the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FADS&lt;/em&gt; gene&lt;/a&gt;, can affect how well the body makes EPA and DHA from plant-based sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People of Amerindian or African ancestry may have variations that change their conversion efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, this means supplements could be especially important to meet their brain’s needs and reduce inflammation-driven behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38911617/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aggression and Violent Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 23:06:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPMExBSEwyMVYtUUtMNlpNVkRDa09xSWV3WTY1ZGZEOUthRW8zN2NPY3JRZ1JUaWhPdHl0VlZJYlY3WXN2WnIySjVoQWwzeTlhQWhXSE1iZDNQZi1PS0Z5aEl6VDZnTWdzdmZSTW5zYWZ6N29aUkhUTHJsNHFXeDRBQ0lxeFlISzdPSGZDQXUtZjFITU1kZnNWYUhmbGg</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将高血压与肠道健康联系起来-了解详情- EatingWell | Scientists Just Linked High Blood Pressure and Gut Health—Here’s What to Know - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE02RkkzMnN2aDh5UWVYbWh3R1RiVGU4eE13SWQzOENld3U3S1U4V3RuMjAxZ2wzSkZ4b1RaLU9GWXlEYXpOU2IxdjU3N2lscmZFTWNZRXZPejNJcVJqVVhDblFHalgzLUMzMkhfYWVMUjU3Rm0zZ1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gut-healthy diet was linked to a 13% lower risk of high blood pressure in U.S. adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more fiber, fermented foods and plant-based options may support gut and heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While gut microbes weren’t directly measured, diet-based scores still showed consistent benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is one of the most common long-term health conditions worldwide, and it can lead to serious problems like heart disease, stroke and kidney issues. It’s a big concern not just for personal health, but also for healthcare systems everywhere due to the costs associated with treating and managing it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why finding ways to prevent and manage high blood pressure is so important.

Some studies have indicated that eating patterns like the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-dash-diet-meal-plan-for-beginners-11738768" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based diets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291716/low-sodium-diet-plan-1500-calories/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low-salt diets&lt;/a&gt;, may help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and improve heart health overall. Interestingly, scientists have also discovered that the collection of tiny organisms living in your gut, known as gut microbiota, might play a key role in how diet affects blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your gut microbiota includes bacteria, fungi and viruses that help with digestion, immune health and even inflammation. When the balance of these microbes is off—often called "&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072214/sneaky-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-according-to-gastroenterologist/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;gut dysbiosis&lt;/a&gt;"—it may increase the risk of conditions like high blood pressure. For example, studies have shown that people with hypertension tend to have less diversity in their gut microbiota and fewer helpful bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s growing interest in how diet and gut health are linked to conditions like high blood pressure, there’s still more to learn, especially about how a test called DI-GM specifically relates to hypertension. DI-GM stands for Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota, and this index looks at factors like the amount of fiber, prebiotics, fermented foods and plant-based foods in your diet—all of which help grow good microorganisms and improve gut diversity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To bridge this research gap, a new study aimed to dig deeper into the connection between blood pressure and gut health using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and the results were published in&lt;em&gt; BMJ Nutrition, Prevention, and Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was The Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate the association between dietary index for gut microbiota and hypertension, researchers used data from NHANES, a large-scale survey run by the CDC to look at the health and nutrition of people living in the United States. NHANES has been collecting detailed health information every two years since 1999. For this analysis, researchers used data from six survey periods between 2007 and 2020. They focused only on participants aged 20 and older, eliminating those who didn’t have complete dietary or health data, as well as those with extremely high or low BMI or calorie intake. Pregnant participants were also excluded. After applying all these filters, a total of 20,804 participants were included in this study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood pressure levels were measured regularly from 2007 to 2020 by a trained healthcare professional. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, was defined as having an average systolic blood pressure of 130 or higher, having an average diastolic blood pressure of 80 or higher or being on blood pressure-lowering medication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The DI-GM used in this study was created using information from NHANES. Participants shared details about what they ate over two separate 24-hour periods, spaced three to 10 days apart, to make sure the data was thorough and accurate. Researchers identified 14 key foods and nutrients that impact gut health, scoring them based on their effects on gut bacteria. If someone ate certain beneficial foods at or above the average for their gender, they earned 1 point; if they consumed too much of less gut-healthy foods, they scored 0 points. The total score ranged from 0 to 13, showing how much a person’s diet supports healthy gut bacteria. A higher score indicates more foods that positively affect gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After adjusting for other factors, DI-GM (a dietary index score capturing certain nutritional patterns) showed a slight protective effect against hypertension, with those in the high DI-GM group having a 13% lower chance compared to the low DI-GM group. Analysis also suggested that this relationship between DI-GM and hypertension is steady and consistent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An important detail to note is that this study did not directly measure the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it looked at how diet patterns, measured using the DI-GM, might reflect gut health. The authors explain that while this method isn’t as precise as directly analyzing the microbiome, it still offers useful insights into how diet may impact gut health and, in turn, blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another limitation to note is that the study used data from NHANES, which only provides a snapshot in time, and it's difficult to say for sure if one thing causes another. For now, it would be safer to say that a gut-healthy diet is associated with lower risk of high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the dietary information relied on people’s self-reports, which can sometimes be inaccurate. Additionally, the DI-GM is just an indicator and doesn’t fully capture the complexity of gut microbes. While the results are relevant to U.S. adults, they might not apply to people elsewhere who have different diets or gut health profiles. Future research could build on these findings by using long-term studies and more precise methods to confirm these relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health and heart health may be more closely connected than you think. Emerging research suggests that by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting your gut&lt;/a&gt; through diet, you could unlock surprising benefits, like better blood pressure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few approachable diet tips for supporting your gut and overall well-being:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize fiber-rich foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Add more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to your meals to promote a diverse and healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include fermented foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir are great for increasing probiotics in your diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore plant-based options.&lt;/strong&gt; Swap out some animal-based meals for plant-based alternatives rich in fiber and nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small, consistent changes like these may make a big difference over time, helping to manage blood pressure and improve your overall health. After all, good health truly starts on your plate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This new study published in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Nutrition, Prevention, and Health&lt;/em&gt; highlights the intriguing connection between diet, gut health and blood pressure. Researchers found that individuals who ate more gut-friendly foods were less likely to have high blood pressure. Although the study didn’t directly measure the gut microbiome, it underscores the role nutrition plays in fostering a healthy microbiota and, by extension, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-heart-health-8610881" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As science continues to uncover the links between what we eat, our gut microbiome and overall health, the message becomes clear: small, intentional dietary changes can lead to meaningful improvements in long-term well-being. Whether it’s adding more fiber-rich foods like fruits and vegetables, incorporating fermented options like yogurt or kimchi, or shifting toward plant-based meals, these steps are accessible and impactful.&lt;br&gt;

The findings suggest that this dietary approach, often associated with weight loss and epilepsy treatment, may also enhance brain function in people without cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal dietary conditions, the brain relies heavily on glucose for fuel. However, when carbohydrate intake drops significantly, the body shifts into a metabolic state known as ketosis. In this state, the liver converts fat into ketone bodies—mainly β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone—which can cross the blood-brain barrier and serve as an alternative energy source for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ketogenic diet is designed to mimic the effects of fasting by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption. Typically, this type of diet provides around 70–75% of calories from fat, 20% from protein, and only 5–10% from carbohydrates. The goal is to shift the body’s metabolism toward fat oxidation and ketone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind the study was based on emerging evidence that ketone bodies might not only serve as a backup fuel source for the brain but could also have direct benefits for brain health. Previous research has shown that individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease often have difficulty using glucose effectively in the brain. Because ketones bypass some of the pathways affected in these conditions, they may help compensate for impaired glucose metabolism and restore energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to acting as fuel, ketone bodies may also influence brain signaling pathways, inflammation, and the production of protective proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron survival and synaptic function. The researchers wanted to find out if these benefits would also apply to cognitively healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the scientists conducted a controlled trial involving 11 cognitively healthy adults who were between the ages of 50 and 70 and classified as overweight. Each participant completed two separate three-week dietary periods in a crossover design, meaning they tried both a ketogenic diet and a standard diet in different phases of the study. There was a one-week break between the two phases. The order of diets was randomized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the ketogenic diet phase, participants consumed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to trigger the production of ketone bodies—molecules the body uses for energy when carbohydrate intake is limited. The diet was composed of approximately 75% fat, 20% protein, and only 5% carbohydrates. Participants were instructed on what to eat and monitored their blood ketone levels twice daily using a flash monitoring device. Those who did not achieve a certain level of ketones in the first week were excluded. During the standard diet phase, participants followed the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, which emphasize a more conventional balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of each diet, the researchers used a combination of advanced brain imaging techniques. At the end of each diet phase, participants underwent a brain scan using positron emission tomography (PET) to measure blood flow in different regions of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were also performed to help align and interpret the PET data. On the same day as the PET scan, blood samples were collected to measure levels of the ketone molecule β-hydroxybutyrate and the neurotrophic protein BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the ketogenic diet significantly elevated both ketone levels and brain-related outcomes. After three weeks on the ketogenic diet, participants’ blood levels of β-hydroxybutyrate increased more than twelvefold compared to the standard diet. This biochemical marker confirmed that participants had entered a state of nutritional ketosis. More importantly, cerebral blood flow was 22% higher on average during the ketogenic phase compared to the standard diet. This increase was observed across multiple regions of the brain and was measured with a high level of precision using PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to improved blood flow, the researchers found that levels of BDNF were 47% higher during the ketogenic diet phase. BDNF is a protein that plays a key role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. It is often described as “fertilizer” for the brain and is believed to support learning and memory. Reduced BDNF levels have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. While previous research had shown that ketone supplements could increase BDNF in the short term, this study demonstrated that sustained nutritional ketosis can also elevate BDNF levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found a strong correlation between blood ketone levels and cerebral blood flow across the two diet phases. In other words, higher ketone concentrations in the blood were associated with greater brain perfusion. This relationship adds further weight to the idea that ketone metabolism plays a direct role in improving brain function, even in the absence of cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the sample size was small—only 11 participants completed the full protocol—the findings were consistent across individuals and backed by rigorous imaging and biochemical assessments. The authors noted that nine participants completed both PET scans, and BDNF data were available for ten participants. Importantly, no serious side effects were reported, and all participants successfully reached and maintained a ketotic state during the ketogenic phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research builds on earlier findings from studies involving people with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, who often experience decreased cerebral blood flow. In those populations, ketogenic diets or ketone supplements have been associated with improvements in brain energy metabolism and function. However, it was previously unclear whether the same benefits would extend to healthy individuals without signs of cognitive decline. This new study fills that gap by showing that a ketogenic diet can enhance both blood flow and neurotrophic support in people without existing brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low cerebral blood flow has been linked to future cognitive decline in both patients and healthy individuals. Several studies have shown that people with lower blood flow in certain brain areas are more likely to experience memory problems and reduced executive functioning over time. By increasing cerebral perfusion, a ketogenic diet might help protect against such decline, although more research is needed to confirm that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also highlighted the potential importance of BDNF in brain aging. BDNF helps regulate synaptic plasticity, the ability of the brain to adapt and reorganize itself, which is vital for learning and memory. Lower BDNF levels are commonly observed in people with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Raising BDNF through diet or other interventions might improve neural resilience and delay the onset of cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s limitations is the small number of participants. While the crossover design helps control for individual variability, a larger sample size would be needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. Another limitation is that the study only included individuals who were overweight, which means the findings might not apply to people of normal weight or those with different metabolic profiles. Additionally, the intervention lasted just three weeks per diet phase. It is not yet known whether these effects would persist or grow stronger with longer-term adherence to a ketogenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore whether similar improvements in cerebral blood flow and BDNF occur in other populations, such as people at risk of dementia, individuals with metabolic syndrome, or even younger adults. Studies could also examine whether these physiological changes translate into measurable improvements in cognitive performance.

Now, a clinical trial suggests the medicines can treat type 1 diabetes, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial results, published June 23 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2500173" target="_blank" data-url="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2500173" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEJM Evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest semaglutide can improve blood sugar levels and induce weight loss in people with type 1, potentially introducing a new drug that could be used along with insulin to manage the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For a hundred years, we are fixated on insulin and insulin delivery … and there aren't really extra medications that are approved for type 1," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/65385/shah-viral" target="_blank" data-url="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/65385/shah-viral" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Viral Shah&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a diabetes researcher at Indiana University, told Live Science. There are some add-on drugs approved for use alongside insulin, but Shah envisions Ozempic-like drugs as a potential firstline treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and impaired release of digestive hormones that fuel type 2 diabetes can also exist in type 1, so it does make sense to explore treatments for those, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="type-1-type-2-and-double-diabetes-3"&gt;Type 1, type 2, and double diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are driven by very different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cells in the pancreas that make insulin become less sensitive to blood sugar and produce less insulin in response. Insulin normally helps usher sugar from the bloodstream into cells, so this effect causes sugar to build up in the blood. Meanwhile, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34803-type-1-diabetes-symptoms-treatment-diagnosis.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34803-type-1-diabetes-symptoms-treatment-diagnosis.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an autoimmune disorder in which the insulin-secreting cells are destroyed by one's own immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, scientists reversed type 1 diabetes by reprogramming a person's own fat cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXAJKUoEBdBCz7ETY6KvzU" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXAJKUoEBdBCz7ETY6KvzU slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/medication/oral-other-injectable-diabetes-medications" target="_blank" data-url="https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/medication/oral-other-injectable-diabetes-medications" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;several drugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for type 2 diabetes that focus on driving cells to secrete more insulin, and there are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351199" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351199" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;standard treatments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; centered around improving blood sugar control, weight loss, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk through lifestyle changes. Drugs like semaglutide, known as GLP-1 agonists, control blood sugar in type 2 by reducing a liver-made hormone that raises blood sugar, as well as slowing down digestion. This makes you feel fuller for longer and allows the pancreas more time to release the right amount of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary way to control blood sugar in type 1 diabetes, however, is insulin replacement. But type 1 diabetics, especially those with obesity, often have insulin resistance and thus many of the same health issues as those with type 2 — for example, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticnerveproblems.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticnerveproblems.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nerve damage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, foot ulcers and eye damage, all due to uncontrolled blood sugar. This condition has been termed "double diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Type 1 diabetes does not exclude the presence of type 2 diabetes," Shah said. "People with the double diabetes phenotype may benefit from some of the medications that are currently approved for type 2 diabetes."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That was the idea behind the new trial of semaglutide, the ingredient found in the weight-loss drug Ozempic and type 2 diabetes drug Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 72 patients with type 1 diabetes and obesity, based on their &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/bmi-health-weight" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/bmi-health-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMIs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Half the participants received a weekly semaglutide injection and the other half a placebo for 26 weeks. All the participants continued using insulin as needed throughout the trial, and their blood sugar was monitored using continuous glucose monitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients taking semaglutide had better control over their blood sugar levels, staying within an acceptable range of blood sugar levels over 70% of the time while also spending less time with low blood sugar levels. The treated individuals also lost at least 5% of their body weight. But no one in the untreated group met all three of these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results support findings from other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_2980271291255122265&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-024-03463-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fozempic-style-drugs-treat-type-1-diabetes-not-only-type-2-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03463-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-024-03463-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fozempic-style-drugs-treat-type-1-diabetes-not-only-type-2-study-finds" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent trials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing that these drugs used for type 2 diabetes are worth exploring in type 1 diabetics, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/expmed/dr-ahmad-haidar" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mcgill.ca/expmed/dr-ahmad-haidar" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ahmad Haidar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a diabetes researcher at McGill University in Canada, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an important study that adds to the existing evidence toward the safety and efficacy of the use of semaglutide in type 1, but it is not enough," Haidar told Live Science. "We need more evidence to help these drugs be approved by regulatory agencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah and his colleagues hope that with more clinical trials with bigger cohorts of patients, the research community will gather enough evidence to have this use of GLP-1s approved by the Food and Drug Administration and added into the American Diabetes Association standards of care for type 1. If approved, the treatments could then potentially be covered by health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And if that happens, I think this would be probably the first drug beyond insulin for people with type 1 diabetes to use," Shah said. "It's really exciting that it's moving forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-gXAJKUoEBdBCz7ETY6KvzU-gzaagZD6w2XRCqGhNjgPCNogxx47Hqjr" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-gXAJKUoEBdBCz7ETY6KvzU-gzaagZD6w2XRCqGhNjgPCNogxx47Hqjr slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
