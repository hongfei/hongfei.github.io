That is 10 to 15 percent above the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Scientists have found a shocking link between alga blooms and Alzheimer's (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Algae blooms contain microscopic organisms that release compounds, which are highly toxic to nerve cells, damaging the brain regions responsible for memory, thinking and communication (Pictured: An algae bloom from above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Maps of algal bloom occurrences and Alzheimer's prevalence overlap in concerning ways,' Davis said. 'We're really worried about people in Florida being exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida has been tracking harmful algal blooms since 1844, but climate change, warmer waters, fertilizer runoff and stagnant canals are fueling 'super-blooms' that can persist for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the blooms may look harmless, appearing as a bright green, blue-green or brown-red paint spilled on the water, they produce dangerous toxins, including β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study in Guam showed that BMAA produced by cyanobacteria entered the local food chain through fruit bats that ate toxic cycad seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Villagers then consumed the bats, ingesting high doses of the toxin. Many developed a rare neurological disorder unique to the island known as ALS-PDC (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex), which combines symptoms of ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Allen Cox, co-author of the Guam study, spent more than two decades researching cyanobacterial toxins and their effects on human health. His findings initially sparked controversy because many people doubted that these toxins could move through the food chain and cause neurological damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Davis said: 'It inspired our research here in Florida, where the same toxins have been detected in the marine food web.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most concerning toxins include BMAA and its chemical relatives 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG), all highly toxic to nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Animal studies have shown that exposure can produce Alzheimer's-like brain damage and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Scientists said that Miami-Dade County (pictured in part) had one of the highest rates of Alzheimer's in the US last year, and the region also experienced major algal blooms in 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found the hallmarks of Alzheimer's in the brains of all the dolphins tested, including misfolded tau proteins (center), amyloid plaques (left) and tangled fibers (right) that destroy neural connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once released into marine environments, these toxins can accumulate up the food chain, eventually reaching dolphins and potentially humans who consume contaminated seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Any exposure to these toxins is concerning,' Davis told the Daily Mail. 'In Florida, doses are likely lower and spread over longer periods, but we don't yet know the long-term effects on humans.' For that, he said, we'd need long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[That] is why experimental models like dolphins are so important,' he added. 'They help us understand potential impacts on public health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now closely monitoring Florida's waterways and seafood supply for cyanobacterial toxins, aiming to better understand the risk to residents and prevent long-term neurological harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They routinely collect samples of fish, shellfish and even water used in aquaculture from areas affected by algal blooms. These samples are then tested in laboratories using chemical analyses such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which can detect even trace amounts of harmful cyanotoxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing often happens before seafood enters the commercial market - for example, at fisheries, docks and seafood processing plants - to ensure contaminated catches are not distributed. In some cases, restaurants and retail markets may also be subject to random spot checks by state inspectors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When toxins are detected, harvest areas are closed until levels return to safe limits. For consumers, this means that the seafood they buy at markets or order at restaurants has likely already passed through several layers of testing and monitoring, designed to catch contamination long before it reaches their plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The team studied 20 dolphins stranded on the shores of Florida's Indian River Lagoon (pictured), finding they all had signs of Alzheimer's &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Davis emphasized the difference in exposure levels between Florida and Guam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Obviously, in Guam, people had a really high dose and developed the disease rapidly,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Here, we're probably looking at smaller doses over longer periods of time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Environmental studies also suggest that the surroundings play a role in Alzheimer's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With Miami‑Dade facing high Alzheimer's rates and repeated algal blooms, the potential connection between these toxins and neurodegenerative disease is a public health concern,' Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Understanding and mitigating exposure is critical for protecting communities.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; it as a “high severity season”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7436a1_w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;109 children&lt;/a&gt; were diagnosed with encephalopathy, or brain swelling, related to flu infection, with one-third of those patients suffering acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Three-quarters of the patients with brain swelling needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and one in five died from the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among the children who were eligible for the vaccine, 89% had not been fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC is launching a new national campaign to “raise awareness and empower Americans with the tools they need to stay healthy during the respiratory virus season”, said Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hilliard did not mention the role of vaccines or respond to a request for more information about the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pediatricians and other trusted figures are stepping into the communications gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We saw a really bad season last year, and I worry that this season could be even worse,” said Jonathan Miller, associate chief of primary care at Nemours Children’s Health and president of the Delaware chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Caitlin Rivers, director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins University, said: “Pediatricians, family doctors, pharmacies are all really important sources of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pediatricians are the most trusted source of information on vaccines, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-the-washington-post-survey-of-parents/#c1001c76-8dd1-4230-8b89-58d04f9f1cba--h-trust-in-sources-of-vaccine-information" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the nonpartisan group KFF. Some 85% of parents said they trust their pediatrician a “great deal” or “fair amount” when it comes to information on vaccines. Only a third of parents said the same of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I feel optimistic that parents will listen to pediatricians and to primary care providers when we encourage them to do this,” Miller said. He works with primary care providers at his facility to recommend the flu vaccine “at every opportunity”, when patients come in for routine visits, follow-ups, or even some sick visits, if they’re well enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Every child benefits from getting vaccinated, Miller said, adding: “If you are high-risk as a child for flu, you are more likely to have bad outcomes, but a lot of kids who are otherwise healthy also have bad outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nearly half (44%) of the children who died last winter had no underlying conditions and common conditions such as asthma are among the underlying conditions adding to risk, Rivers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People don’t always perceive themselves or their kids as being at higher risk, but, in fact, they may be,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the flu vaccine doesn’t stop onward transmission entirely, it does lessen it. “It reduces the risk of you passing on the virus to other people,” Rivers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last season, the hardest-hit group was infants under the age of six months, who cannot yet get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC’s “wild to mild” campaign, which focused on how flu vaccines protect against severe illness and death, first began in 2023 and was “very, very well received” among the public, said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, at a recent press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The health department suspended it soon after Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the CDC, “they’re not allowed to talk about that campaign, despite the fact that it had very clear messaging”, Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even before the shutdown, there has been really a concerted effort to limit communication around vaccines, specifically influenza,” he said, noting that he expects “that we’re not going to see a brisk uptake of flu vaccine” since “there’s already a lot of confusion around vaccines because of what’s happened with RFK Jr”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the absence of clear guidance, health providers may hesitate to offer vaccines against respiratory illnesses such as flu, Covid, and RSV, Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But medical groups, such as the AAP, are making vaccination recommendations, and the American Lung Association &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-lung-association-launches-campaign-to-educate-people-living-with-lung-cancer-and-lung-disease-about-critical-vaccines-302590505.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new campaign in October to educate people on vaccines for the respiratory season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Providers and health systems are also stepping up local vaccine messages, giving the shots greater prominence than in years past, Miller said. For families skeptical of the shot, providers can offer the nasal-spray vaccines, he said. They’re very safe and effective, and they can be given to children two years and older without medical contraindications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think that’s helping some families feel more comfortable getting vaccinated than they otherwise would have been,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Making it easy to remember and schedule the shots also helps, Rivers said. “People respond really well to convenience and reminders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/season-outlook25-26.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt; this year’s respiratory virus season to be similar to last year’s. Yet severe outbreaks in Australia and Japan, the latter of which has declared a flu epidemic, has experts concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not a direct lesson for what we can expect, but it’s a clue,” Rivers said. “And that does give me pause that maybe we’ll be in for something a little bit bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Respiratory viruses are “unpredictable” and can mutate and change, Miller pointed out. The best way to stay protected is to get updated vaccines each year, he said. During the US government shutdown, the CDC did not publish data on national flu trends as it normally does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s very laborious and difficult, I think, for the average person to access high-quality data right now compared to when CDC is participating in reporting,” Rivers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While states report some of the data publicly, “it’s just data”, Rivers said. “If you’re not accustomed to looking at the data and understanding what it means, it might not give you enough information to really make choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And the lack of guidance signals a worrying trend, Rivers said: “There are very severe possible consequences for allowing our public health system to degrade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOZE8telAydVlvXzhUZUdyQWpPVDI3RTVEZzU4a29wSXZBNC1TOWpjcUdxdk5BUUNCZk0xVnp4c2lpa0lYWnRfVGtsMXBtT056VkFheFhfZTFYWjN2QW1xaGNYbnhCUlRRRVMydzd6R0ZJUHZpZjYxT3JQSm10VFdHaEJLU1lmOHo0</guid></item><item><title>北格伦报告的Parvo疫情，控制在单身家庭：警方- kdvr.com</title><link>https://kdvr.com/news/local/parvo-outbreak-reported-in-northglenn-contained-to-single-home-police/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Getting older might seem like a slow, gradual process – but research suggests that this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and wonder if your aging somehow accelerated, you might not be imagining things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2024 study into the molecular changes associated with aging, humans experience two abrupt lurches forward, one at the average age of 44 and the other at around age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/longevity-supplement-rejuvenates-aging-immune-cells-in-just-4-weeks"&gt;Longevity Supplement 'Rejuvenates' Aging Immune Cells in Just 4 Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not just changing gradually over time; there are some really dramatic changes," geneticist Michael Snyder of Stanford University &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that's true no matter what class of molecules you look at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study's findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging is a complex process &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-caused-by-brain-cells-that-age-too-fast"&gt;associated with an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues investigated the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-how-young-blood-reverses-aging-in-human-skin-cells"&gt;biology of aging&lt;/a&gt; to gain a deeper understanding of what changes occur and how, in order to better mitigate and treat these ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tracked a group of 108 adults, who had been donating biological samples every few months over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noticed that in&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-021-09910-5"&gt; some conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="180677" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/6/2/19"&gt; cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, risk doesn't rise gradually with time; it escalates sharply after a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they wanted to take a closer look at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-suggests-key-differences"&gt;biomarkers of aging&lt;/a&gt; to see if they could identify related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg" alt="An older male squatting with outstretched arms in a park" class="wp-image-132987 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The molecular changes associated with aging show that humans experience two drastic lurches forward.

The different molecules studied include RNA, proteins, lipids, and microbiome taxa from the gut, skin, nasal, and oral regions, for a total of 135,239 biological features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant submitted an average of 47 samples over 626 days, with the longest-serving participant providing 367 samples. This wealth of data resulted in more than 246 billion data points, which the researchers then processed, looking for patterns in the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have found non-linear changes in molecular abundances that can be linked to aging in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31091-5"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0673-2"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of fruit flies, mice, and zebrafish have also pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2024.1378351/full"&gt;stepwise aging process in these species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues observed a distinct change in the abundance of many different kinds of molecules in the human body at two distinct stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 81 percent of all the molecules they studied showed changes during one or both of these stages. Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s, with slightly different profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-40s peak showed changes in molecules related to the metabolism of lipids, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-may-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-reveals"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and alcohol, as well as cardiovascular disease, and dysfunctions in skin and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s peak was associated with carbohydrate and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="180677" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; metabolism, cardiovascular disease, skin and muscle, immune regulation, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-7-common-daily-habits-could-be-damaging-your-kidneys"&gt;kidney function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-class-of-drug-created-that-fights-aging-on-a-cellular-level"&gt;A New Class of Drug Created That Fights Aging on a Cellular Level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first peak, the mid-40s, is typically when women start undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-isnt-as-responsible-for-lost-libido-as-we-always-thought"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-mental-health-risks-of-perimenopause-identified-for-first-time"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers ruled this out as a main factor: Men, too, also underwent significant molecular changes at the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained metabolomicist and first author Xiaotao Shen&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Stanford, now at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Identifying and studying these factors should be a priority for future research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg" alt="A young woman's face next to an older woman's face, both are smiling" class="size-full wp-image-144095" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A berry used in traditional folk medicine holds a remarkable power to restore healthy fat metabolism as well as insulin sensitivity in a diabetes model in mice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny red fruit come from a little-known shrub called &lt;a href="https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:873340-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii &lt;/em&gt;Kom.&lt;/a&gt; (NRK), which grows in the dry temperate regions of Western and Northern China, Mongolia, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a long history in local folk medicine, and scientists suspected that modern pharmacology could explain why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-glp-1-triggers-ozempic-alternatives"&gt;Experts Reveal a Drug-Free Way to Mimic The Effects of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plant from the same genus,&lt;a href="https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:873347-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Nitraria tangutorum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has already been found to lower blood levels of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d3fo02495d"&gt;lipids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130412"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; in animal models, so a team led by Di Wu of Qinghai University in China tested whether NRK could have similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concentrated extract of the berry given to diabetic mice not only normalized their blood sugar levels, but also improved their lipid (fat) metabolism and reduced oxidative stress associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180875" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breadth of effects is rarely seen in single manufactured drugs, the authors note, which suggests the berry extract may be fundamentally resetting the body's underlying metabolic issues, rather than acting on individual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are exciting because they suggest we might be able to treat diabetes more holistically," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092492"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; organic chemist Huilan Yue, from the Northwestern Institute of Plateau Biology in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of just lowering blood sugar like most medications, this plant extract appears to help the body regain its natural metabolic balance. The implications could extend beyond diabetes to other conditions involving insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty male mice were divided into groups at random: 14 were assigned to a control group, fed normal chow, and 65 were part of the model type-2 diabetes group, in which they were fed high-sugar and high-fat chow and injected with streptozotocin, to kill off the insulin-producing cells in their livers (one mouse didn't make it to the main experiment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 'diabetic' mice, some were given no treatment, some were given &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; (a common diabetes medicine), and the rest were treated with low, medium, and high doses of concentrated NRK extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across seven weeks, the scientists measured the animals' weights and fasting blood glucose levels. After this period, the mice were killed so their blood and organs could be inspected more closely.&lt;br&gt;

And, compared to diabetic mice not treated with the extract, insulin sensitivity was restored in NRK-treated mice by nearly 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their internal organs were also in far better shape by the end of the experiment, with their liver and pancreas seemingly protected from the damage that induced diabetes wrought on untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the increasing number of drugs related to the treatment of type 2 diabetes, many of them lead to drug tolerance and side effects affecting the health of the organism," the authors &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRK could "significantly improve fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, hepatic glycogen levels and lipid levels, and significantly [reduce] insulin resistance of diabetic mice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these results suggested that [concentrated NRK extract] might be a potential drug for improving insulin resistance and reducing hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes," they &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613"&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 3,500 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases have been reported in Texas so far this year, already reaching a 11-year high even though two more highly infectious months are left in the year, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uptick in whooping cough, which is especially contagious in children, has &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2024-2025_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf"&gt;coincided with a decline in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for the illness, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/whooping-cough-surges-vaccines-decline-us-rcna201853"&gt;disease experts&lt;/a&gt; who urge the best way to control the spread is to get vaccinated. They also say whooping cough tends to spike every few years and that there isn’t a way to completely wipe out the disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We practitioners and public health professionals are concerned because we are seeing a year-after-year trend of a significant increase in cases when this is preventable,” said Hector Ocaranza, a pediatrician and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.texmed.org/"&gt;Texas Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;’s Council on Science and Health Promotion. “Especially a disease that can have such a severe effect on infants, older people, and those who have chronic conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more than 3,500 cases of whooping cough through October, quadruple the number of cases during the same period last year, which saw a total of 1,907 cases, according to provisional data. The total so far is also 10 times the number of cases for all of 2023. This is the second consecutive year the state’s health agency has had to issue a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas"&gt;health alert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency’s most recent alert, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas"&gt;published Nov. 3&lt;/a&gt;, noted that more than half of last year’s cases occurred in November and December, suggesting whooping cough cases will continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Bowling, professor and infectious disease specialist at UT Health San Antonio, the academic health center of The University of Texas at San Antonio, said this spike is aligning with the holiday season, further increasing the risk of whooping cough spreading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oftentimes parents with a newborn infant don’t feel comfortable telling people to wash their hands or not to visit if they have a cough during the holidays, but they need to feel empowered and comfortable to do that right now,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.cap.org/spokespersons/c.-leilani-valdes--md--mba--fcap/s/8a25bc04-0396-4e4b-b332-92d1d81e741c"&gt;Leilani Valdes&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Citizens Medical Center in Victoria, and a spokesperson for the College of American Pathologists, said this year’s spike is noticeably different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While an increase isn’t completely unexpected, the size of this one is unusual and something public health officials are keeping a close eye on,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valdes said multiple factors are contributing to the increase. She said immunity from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html"&gt;whooping cough vaccine&lt;/a&gt; fades over time, and if people aren’t getting their booster shots, they can catch and spread it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some families have also fallen behind on vaccinations, which adds to the problem. And finally, better testing and awareness mean more cases are being identified and reported,” Valdes said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973"&gt;Whooping cough&lt;/a&gt; cases in Texas and the United States were lower than usual during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but activity has quickly rebounded over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were not near each other during COVID-19, which meant fewer opportunities for the bacteria to move from person to person,” said Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatric medical provider and a public health professor at Johns Hopkins University. “What is concerning with this spike is the number of small children being affected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent rise in whooping cough in Texas follows a national trend. In 2024, there were more than &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/175367"&gt;35,000 documented cases&lt;/a&gt;, a significant jump from 7,063 in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths"&gt;Two babies&lt;/a&gt; have died from the disease in Louisiana this year, as well as a &lt;a href="https://doh.sd.gov/press-releases/south-dakota-department-of-health-reports-pertussis-death/"&gt;child in South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://cdh.idaho.gov/cdh-alerts-about-death-from-pertussis/"&gt;adult in Idaho&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data from the Texas health agency indicate that approximately 85% of whooping cough cases in Texas this year have occurred in children, but no deaths have been reported. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is whooping cough? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a highly contagious illness caused by the bacteria &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7813/"&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973"&gt;contagious respiratory illnesses&lt;/a&gt; occur when bacteria attach to the upper respiratory tract, leading to swelling of the airways.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The interesting thing about this bacterial infection is that it lasts for a long time. In China, it’s known as the 100-day cough for this reason. It’s a disease that is really split into three phases,” said Bowling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease usually starts off looking like a regular cold, with a runny nose, a fever and a mild cough. This is the most transmissible phase of the disease. An &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/pertussis-precautions-whooping-cough-outbreaks-infections-in-us/"&gt;estimated 80% people&lt;/a&gt; will contract the illness after close exposure to someone who is infected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a week or two, that cough can turn into prolonged, intense coughing fits that can make it hard to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“In adolescents and adults, it’s just a really bad cough. In babies, it’s a cough related to the struggle to breathe, and it makes this huge gasp sound like a whoop, and that is why it’s known as a whooping cough,” said Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final phase, known as the recovery stage, can last several weeks, during which the cough gradually fades. Still, the person remains at risk of other respiratory infections due to airway damage, and the cough can return, sometimes for several months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is vulnerable?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies under six months are most at risk because they’re too young to be fully vaccinated. One in three babies with &lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/whooping-cough.html"&gt;whooping cough requires hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;, while one in five will develop pneumonia, and some will develop seizures or brain swelling. Many infants with the illness don’t cough at all but gag, and have skin, lips, or nails that turn blue or purple because of a pause in breathing that lasts longer than 20 seconds, often known as life-threatening &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5331238/"&gt;apnea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to be fast and test quickly if you think your baby has been exposed. The challenge is that the further along in the disease when the coughing and spasms appear, the damage is already done, and it’s too late to treat the bacteria,” said Sharfstein. “If you have a 10-year-old who has been coughing all the time, and you notice the newborn baby now has a cold, I would test right away.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Healthy teens and adults can also catch whooping cough and may develop pneumonia. The coughing fits may cause vomiting, fatigue, and even broken ribs. Still, the risk of death significantly drops compared to infants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If caught early enough, antibiotics can help make the illness milder and stop it from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the worst things I have witnessed in my pediatric career is the helplessness of parents as they watch their young one struggle to breathe from pertussis. It’s awful, but it’s preventable,” said Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to protect yourself? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSHS states in its health alert that the best way to protect against whooping cough is immunization, and that parents should ensure children are up to date on pertussis immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine, better known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/tdap.html"&gt;Tdap&lt;/a&gt;, is for children 7 years old and older, adolescents, and adults, while the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine, known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/dtap.html"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt;, is for children between 6 weeks and 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also recommended that pregnant women receive the &lt;a href="https://immunize.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sample_vis_dtap.pdf"&gt;DTaP vaccine&lt;/a&gt; during each pregnancy to pass protection to their newborns. Optimal timing is between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, preferably during the earlier part of this period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;also recommends&lt;/a&gt; that everyone around the infant be up to date with their booster shots, which are recommended every 10 years. The majority of whooping cough cases in infants &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/infectious-diseases/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-pertussis"&gt;are transmitted&lt;/a&gt; by parents, grandparents, or other family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, many adults believe they don’t need vaccinations anymore and don’t get the boosters,” said Ocaranza. “But the best practice shows that those young people who are about to start a family and those around them need to be updated on their vaccinations.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the vaccine is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease, various regions across the state are experiencing low vaccination rates in schools, increasing the risk of an outbreak among children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The measles outbreak in Texas was a warning bell ringing that people weren’t getting vaccinated enough,” said Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2024-2025_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf"&gt;Texas schools that report immunization rates&lt;/a&gt; to DSHS, 93.4% of seventh graders were fully vaccinated with Tdap in the 2024-25 school year, and 92.9% of kindergarteners were fully vaccinated with the DTaP. Coverage rates for those and other vaccines required for school admission &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/"&gt;have declined in recent years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Simple steps like washing your hands, covering your cough, and keeping distance from babies when ill can go a long way in preventing the spread,” Valdes said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunized children and adults can also still get the disease. The immunized may present with milder symptoms and lack the classic “whoop” sound during coughing. Someone suspected of having whooping cough should stay home until they have completed five days of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;

                Science has evolved over the 20 years since the FDA added warning labels to hormone therapy for menopause and there's been a shift in how estrogen is administered.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Women should not suffer through menopause with hot flashes, night sweats and poor sleep. That's the message from FDA Commissioner &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5604283/fda-menopause-hormone-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Marty Makary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The agency announced it will remove "black box" warning labels from estrogen-based hormone therapy, which treat the symptoms of menopause, saying the warnings have made women scared to try the therapy and doctors reluctant to prescribe it. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The warnings stem from the early 2000s when data from the &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Women's Health Initiative study&lt;/a&gt; found hormone therapy increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, women in that study were given a type of hormone therapy formulation that is no longer commonly used. And the average age of women in the study was 63, which is now considered too late to start hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, experts say there's a lot more known about safe and effective combinations, when therapy is initiated earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're under age 60 or within ten years of menopause onset, when you start hormone therapy, you're going to see improvements in hot flashes, sweats, fewer sleep disruptions, " says &lt;a href="https://uvahealth.azcontentstackapps.com/providers/JoAnn-Pinkerton-1437283801" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton&lt;/a&gt;, a menopause expert at the University of Virginia Health. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also points to protection against bone loss and fractures, as well as potential benefits for heart health, brain fog and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When it's dosed appropriately, hormone therapy can be given safely and have multiple benefits," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But here's an important reality check: "Not all women can take hormone therapy," Pinkerton says. She says some women have medical conditions or symptoms that can make hormone therapy risky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you," Pinkerton says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, here are some things to consider when talking to your healthcare provider about hormone therapy for menopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. When should you start hormone therapy? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts recommend starting estrogen therapy before the age of 60 or within ten years of the start of menopause — which begins one year after your last period. Many women remain on birth control through perimenopause, which can help with hot flashes and night sweats as hormones fluctuate. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once you're through the menopause transition and you don't need pregnancy prevention, then it doesn't make as much sense to use birth control, Pinkerton says, because it's typically stronger than the amount of estrogen used in menopause hormone therapy, so that's a good time to talk to your provider about hormone therapy options.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. How long should you be on hormone therapy?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In general, women stay on hormone therapy for three to five years, but that's not a hard and fast rule. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For women who have persistent symptoms or bone loss — which can be treated with hormone therapy — we will continue it," Pinkerton says. But, it's important to keep assessing each year. "It's about working with the patient to come up with what's safest and best," Pinkerton says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't take someone off [hormone therapy] just because it's been three to five years, " says Lauren Streicher of Northwestern University. She points to differences in how long menopause symptoms persist, noting that Black and Hispanic women tend to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4433164/#:~:text=%2C%209.4%20years).-,Women%20who%20were%20postmenopausal%20at%20the%20onset%20of%20VMS%20had,per%20week%20were%20statistically%20significant." target="_blank"&gt;experience symptoms for longer &lt;/a&gt;  time periods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. How has hormone therapy changed?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Science has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;evolved over the last 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, since the results of the Women's Health Initiative came out. And, importantly, there's been a shift in how estrogen is administered, as well as new formulations of hormones. For instance, many women are now prescribed patches instead of pills.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that oral therapy can slightly increase the risk of blood clots and stroke," Pinkerton says, so providers often opt for transdermal therapy for women at risk of these conditions. Transdermal patches, gels or rings deliver estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin which research shows can&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30626577/" target="_blank"&gt; lower the risk&lt;/a&gt; of blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Also, women enrolled in the WHI study were given synthetic progestin which was linked to an increased breast cancer risk. But, now doctors can prescribe &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=micronized+progesterone&amp;amp;sca_esv=0921862a250ef5a9&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCFQ_enUS1108US1108&amp;amp;ei=WBgRac3EENug5NoPruXaaA&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi97o_WkeaQAxUnMlkFHUDKGdwQgK4QegQIARAC&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=what+is+the+new+type+of+micronized+progesterone+for+menopause+with+transdermal+estrogen&amp;amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiV3doYXQgaXMgdGhlIG5ldyB0eXBlIG9mIG1pY3Jvbml6ZWQgcHJvZ2VzdGVyb25lIGZvciBtZW5vcGF1c2Ugd2l0aCB0cmFuc2Rlcm1hbCBlc3Ryb2dlbkiPQFD2AljDPnABeAGQAQCYAZoBoAHZDaoBBDE5LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAg2gAscJwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICBRAhGKABwgIFECEYnwXCAgUQIRirApgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzguNaAHmn2yBwM3LjW4B7wJwgcFMC43LjbIBzM&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp&amp;amp;mstk=AUtExfCrBsvpMmtLAmg31UA0nlsOnqf0NnCVPhv3Nfoib12HCSlJMxQS8b8YxjwWbRNuCwkwLG4rExnNwFVqXYjS50EYObYF-BqpAwU-QoYPE2sKIz7jkzGv0JoQYcbKNCPD8JKHX5LfBKziVqqDj0EF1y3WSQxQNhl9RqRVoVegEnrjYyWlHjmqB8Vhgi6MdVFGglEZ&amp;amp;csui=3" target="_blank"&gt; micronized progesterone&lt;/a&gt; that has fewer side effects. Micronized progesterone is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4960754/#:~:text=Micronized%20progesterone%20is%20a%20bioidentical%20hormone%20with,have%20a%20different%20chemical%20structure%20from%20progesterone." target="_blank"&gt;a bioidentical hormone &lt;/a&gt;with a molecular structure identical to the estrogen produced in the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Do all estrogen products carry the same risks?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No. Local estrogen, such as low-dose vaginal creams, target symptoms such as vaginal dryness, painful sex, bladder control and reduced risk of urinary tract infections. This is different from systemic estrogen, delivered through pills, patches or gels. Systemic estrogen is a higher-dose treatment that circulates throughout the body to address symptoms including hot flashes and night sweats, and can carry a higher risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think most would agree that with local, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy that the risks are negligible," says &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/monica-christmas" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago. "For local, vaginal estrogen, it's reasonable to remove the black box warning. I don't think we need to scare people unnecessarily," Christmas says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, for higher dose, systemic estrogen therapy — which is absorbed into the blood stream — including estrogen pills, Christmas and other menopause experts are more equivocal about removing the black box warning. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It provides a pause," Christmas says, and prompts patients to discuss the risks with their providers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;5. Who should avoid hormone therapy? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some women have medical conditions that can make hormone therapy more risky. This includes women with estrogen sensitive breast or uterine cancer, and women who are at high risk for or have had a heart attack, stroke, blood clot, or pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you," Pinkerton says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;6. Are there alternatives for women who don't  want to take hormone therapy?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved two non-hormonal medications to treat severe hot flashes in menopause. According to the FDA, about 80% of menopausal women experience hot flashes which can include &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-drug-treat-moderate-severe-hot-flashes-caused-menopause#:~:text=Some%20women%20who%20experience%20hot,to%20test%20for%20liver%20damage." target="_blank"&gt;sweating, flushing and chills&lt;/a&gt; that last for several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lynkuet-us.com/?utm_campaign=LYN_DTC_cpc_google_BRN&amp;amp;utm_content=BRN_MNP_ALL_PHR_X_X&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=23215908903&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAABB5RiLZ5oBFBGqfgVIyEJR-VRW8yM&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5abIBhCaARIsAM3-zFVYIqChCDYO99CXDWF-XQWEI_KUpri5jr-FEzmEnRyEGs2YtdQNifUaAg19EALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;Lynkuet&lt;/a&gt;, which was approved last month, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-drug-treat-moderate-severe-hot-flashes-caused-menopause#:~:text=Some%20women%20who%20experience%20hot,to%20test%20for%20liver%20damage." target="_blank"&gt;Veozah&lt;/a&gt;, which was approved in 2023, are both oral medications that work by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-drug-treat-moderate-severe-hot-flashes-caused-menopause#:~:text=Some%20women%20who%20experience%20hot,to%20test%20for%20liver%20damage." target="_blank"&gt;targeting the neural activity&lt;/a&gt; that causes hot flashes during menopause. Lynkuet has been shown to reduce the severity and frequencies of hot flashes. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health has &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/menopause/hot-flashes-what-can-i-do" target="_blank"&gt;tips for managing symptoms,&lt;/a&gt; including limiting alcohol and caffeine, and maintaining a healthy body weight. And early-stage research shows hypnotherapy and mindfulness meditation may help manage hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people find herbal remedies helpful. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5783135/" target="_blank"&gt; A study of medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; including sage, lemon balm, red clover and licorice finds they may be effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The bats need to eat blood every two to three days to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"People are getting bitten by bats routinely and for many, many years nothing can happen

witnessed an increasing spread of rabies across the landscape which is advancing at a rate of between 10km (6 miles) and 20km (12 miles) every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They are aiming to improve understanding of the reasons for the spread to anticipate where communities are most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Since 2007, researchers have been taking blood and faeces samples from vampire bats at dozens of locations to check for signs of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Theses include monitoring rabies in bat caves in Peru, where nets are installed on cave entrances to capture the bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The samples are flown back to Glasgow for lab testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results helps them track the spread so communities can be warned to take preventative action through vaccination of themselves and their

feeding opportunities for the mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Human attempts to catch and kill bats in areas where rabies is present is also understood to be driving infected animals into new areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the long run, the teams are hoping to develop vaccination programmes that can be administered into the bat populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One way of doing this involves administering the vaccine onto the animals as a paste and relying on transmission through other bats licking the fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The process has been tested in lab conditions with field trials expected to begin soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the process is self-limiting, meaning only those immediately surrounding the treated bat would ingest the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Scientists are also working on a transmissible vaccine which can spread throughout the population without having to rely solely on the original treated animal.

			&lt;p&gt;Poor health in one part of the body often leads to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-yet-again"&gt;problems elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. A new study links gum disease with an increased risk of damage to the brain's white matter, which transmits signals around the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings aren't conclusive, but they suggest that persistent inflammation in the mouth could be harming the brain as well – and that practicing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-re-probably-brushing-your-teeth-wrong-here-are-4-expert-tips-for-better-dental-health"&gt;good oral hygiene&lt;/a&gt; may benefit white matter in the brain as well as gums and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study, led by a team from the University of South Carolina, were particularly interested in white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). These are key markers of cerebral small vessel disease or CSVD, which affects the brain's blood vessels and increases the chances of a stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-popular-diet-seems-to-reduce-gum-disease-scientists-say"&gt;This Popular Diet Seems to Reduce Gum Disease, Scientists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows a link between gum disease and white matter hyperintensities suggesting oral health may play a role in brain health that we are only beginning to understand," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5289"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Souvik Sen, vascular neurologist at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dentist-visit-might-have-triggered-rare-brain-bleed-in-patient"&gt;dental exams&lt;/a&gt; and brain scans for 1,143 adult participants, finding that those with gum disease, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;, (800 of the group) had a higher average volume of WMHs: 2.83 percent of total brain volume, compared to 2.52 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180674" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck.jpg" alt="Dental checkup" class="wp-image-180674 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180674" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Good oral hygiene could be linked to brain health.

Even so, the statistics are suggestive enough to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gum disease is preventable and treatable," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251029100147.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen. "If future studies confirm this link, it could offer a new avenue for reducing cerebral small vessel disease by targeting oral inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being associated with CSVD, WMHs also often increase &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;with age&lt;/a&gt;. Their presence is thought to indicate underlying injuries in the brain, which can have an impact on abilities like balance, memory recall, and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How this might be exacerbated by gum disease isn't clear, but there's a growing amount of evidence that &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/inflammation-and-brain-health"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – where the body's immune system goes into harmful overdrive in an attempt to protect itself – can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crohns-disease-scientists-say-bacteria-in-the-mouth-may-be-a-cause"&gt;spread between conditions&lt;/a&gt; and between parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers have also recently &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/21-year-study-links-gum-disease-and-cavities-to-higher-stroke-risk"&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; that found an association between both gum diseases and tooth cavities, and having a higher risk of stroke. These links underline just how important oral health is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034512457373"&gt;almost half&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the US have some form of gum disease, tackling that problem could have knock-on benefits for health more generally. However, the researchers also raise the possibility that shared risk factors for blood vessel health are potentially affecting both gums and brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While more research is needed to understand this relationship, these findings add to growing evidence that keeping your mouth healthy may support a healthier brain," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251029100147.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000037"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cf8e528e-76bc-4923-aa18-636fab396b7e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphere","elementId":"cf8e528e-76bc-4923-aa18-636fab396b7e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/measles-outbreak-ontario-canada"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a deeply disheartening development. It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada – or other countries in North America even – should lose their measles elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada’s loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As a region, we have eliminated measles twice,” Barbosa said. “We can do it a third time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 02:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNWU41WGZnRzBTaXlycV9pWnc0ZjRTWEJLWTRGSW1ubzlOQWFxMlNSbjhZcmNXaG5PalRnLVFQT1JnNFFZbVJUSHF1djZVRjJGTVNnUWVEUWtwYlZZX0lSWkRJX210azhmU2s1UzJOV3MzbXBVVHN3eWJjcHN6Q0gxY0FtM3JtU01uUWZCbnlkTXBaQXF2</guid></item><item><title>男性生存率提高40% ：配对两种抗癌药物可降低前列腺癌死亡风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/40-boost-in-survival-for-men-pairing-two-cancer-drugs-may-reduce-prostate-cancer-death-risk/articleshow/125212555.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment where medical innovation meets real-life impact, the recent findings from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2303974" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;landmark EMBARK trial, published in the The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, offer not just clinical news but a fresh lens on how men can engage with their health, lifestyle and future. The study has shown that pairing two drugs, namely Leuprolide (a testosterone-suppressing injection) and Enzalutamide (a pill that blocks residual effects of testosterone), results in a significant jump in survival for men with high-risk, recurring prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many men, prostate health can feel like a silent guest in the room that is quietly monitored, occasionally remarked upon but rarely occupying headline-status in everyday life. This study turns that narrative slightly by showing how we engage with the body, the screen-time, the check-ups, the mindset and all of it can ripple into meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The heart of the discovery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited more than 1,000 men across 17 countries who had undergone treatment for localised prostate cancer but then faced “biochemical recurrence”. In practical terms, their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were climbing, even though no outward metastasis had yet been detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These men were at high risk, defined by a PSA doubling time of nine months or less. That matters because a faster doubling time signals a more aggressive disease course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were randomly assigned into one of three paths:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A combination treatment of Enzalutamide and Leuprolide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leuprolide alone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enzalutamide alone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After roughly 5 years of follow-up, the results were striking. In the combination group, 5-year metastasis-free survival was 87.3%, compared with 71.4% in the Leuprolide alone group (hazard ratio for metastasis or death: 0.42). Enzalutamide alone also outperformed Leuprolide alone (80.0% 5-year survival) with a hazard ratio of 0.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Yet, it is not just the numbers that resonate, it is the lifestyle implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for everyday life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical recurrence does not always feel dramatic as the body may seem “okay” and the day-to-day may look normal but the molecular clock is ticking. Recognising the importance of early detection, through PSA monitoring, consulting with urologists and staying attentive to subtle changes can turn a passive stance into an empowered one. This study proves that early, targeted intervention works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment advances don’t override wellness, they amplify it. While the study’s focus is medication, the lifestyle narrative remains central that men who are attentive to health, who keep their check-ups and who stay in conversation with their doctors, are better positioned. Moreover, treatments that prolong “metastasis-free survival” mean more years where quality of life matters that is during weekends with friends, travel, hobbies, meaningful roles and yes, less anxiety about the “when will it spread” question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mindset shift: From “let’s wait” to “let’s live”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the subtle takeaways is that when men know their health tools are evolving, there is less reason to feel resigned or passive. This becomes a story of maintenance and proactive wellbeing, not just “coping”. The combination therapy acts like an upgrade in the toolkit but the person holds the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality of life still matters very much. A common concern with aggressive treatments is, “At what cost?” The study carefully measured patient-reported outcomes (quality-of-life indices) and found no substantial deterioration in the combination group compared to standard therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It offers men and all of us interested in wellness, a clearer vision that proactive health is not just about eating better or exercising, it is about staying engaged, informed and intentional. When combined with advanced therapies like enzalutamide-plus-leuprolide, lifestyle becomes the foundation and medicine becomes the amplifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

A new study suggests that advice may need a rethink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 200 people in the US, Canada, and Australia who were about to undergo &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/electrical-cardioversion"&gt;electrical cardioversion&lt;/a&gt; for atrial fibrillation (AF). All were current or former coffee drinkers. Half agreed to avoid coffee for six months; the other half agreed to drink at least one cup per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the six months, the researchers tracked AF recurrences lasting more than 30 seconds. In the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;coffee-drinker&lt;/a&gt; group, 47 percent had an episode of AF, compared with 64 percent of abstainers. That equates to a 39 percent lower risk for coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-pouches-can-pack-2-coffees-in-1-hit-heres-why-theyre-a-risk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Pouches Can Pack 2 Coffees in 1 Hit.

We know that coffee can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-coffee-boost-your-exercise-performance-here-s-what-three-experts-have-to-say"&gt;boost exercise performance&lt;/a&gt;, which could protect against AF episodes (the study didn't collect detailed diet/exercise data).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence.jpg" alt="Atrial fibrillation chart" class="wp-image-180856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cases of atrial fibrillation were less common in coffee drinkers.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors block a protein that tumor cells create to deactivate immune cells, essentially training patients' immune systems to kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study who got either the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccines within 100 days of beginning immunotherapy were more than &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; as likely to survive after three years as patients who didn't receive either jab. Further, patients whose tumors don't respond well to immunotherapy were &lt;em&gt;five times&lt;/em&gt; more likely to survive past three years if they had a Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine than patients who didn't get vaccinated. Finally, these results held up even when researchers factored in variables like co-morbidities, disease severity and patients' other medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh, this is pretty huge, but what does it all actually mean in practice? We asked infectious disease experts and oncologists to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-common-covid-symptoms-october-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Most Common COVID-19 Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Most Common COVID-19 Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study opens an intriguing possibility: that modern mRNA vaccines—originally designed to prevent viral infections—may enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-researcher/search-researcher-directory/zihai-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, founding director of&lt;br&gt;Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology, Klotz Memorial Chair in Cancer Research and professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, explains. "In other words, receiving an mRNA vaccine around the time of immunotherapy could 'prime' the immune system to respond more vigorously against cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That surely sounds promising, but Dr. Li points out something significant in the research that's important to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings are most directly relevant to solid tumors such as lung cancer and melanoma, where they have the most data, and that checkpoint blockade is already a mainstay of treatment," he says. "However, much remains to be learned ... In patients, the only mRNA vaccines they looked at were mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV2. If confirmed, these findings could reshape how we integrate vaccines and immunotherapy, transforming preventive vaccines into therapeutic allies against cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, please keep in mind that this isn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Current clinical guidelines, including those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), do not recognize direct anti-cancer effects as a rationale for COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients," &lt;a href="https://www.healthtrackrx.com/for-practitioners/meet-steven-goldberg-md-mba-chief-medical-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer at HealthTrackRx, advises. "The primary benefit of COVID-19 vaccination in this population is the prevention of COVID-19 and its complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-that-makes-vaccines-less-effective-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Surprising Habit Could Make Your Vaccine Less Effective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Surprising Habit Could Make Your Vaccine Less Effective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can Other Vaccines Help Fight Cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed a lot of promise in terms of two specific types of mRNA COVID vaccines in the fight against certain cancers. Could other vaccines show that benefit too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to experts we spoke with, it's too soon to tell just yet. "We will have to study if other mRNA vaccines could have the same type of benefit, or if this is only seen in mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.texasoncology.com/oncologist/jeff-yorio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jeff Yorio, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jeff Yorio, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, medical oncologist and research site leader at Texas Oncology, tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;. "Pneumonia vaccines and flu vaccines, which are not mRNA-based, did not change the response to immunotherapy. This was a retrospective study so more work will need to be done to verify the results, but it is definitely a promising finding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study just looked at mRNA based COVID vaccines, but it did look at different manufacturers," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.houstonmethodist.org/en/persons/s-wesley-long" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. S. Wesley Long, MD, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. S. Wesley Long, MD, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, associate professor of clinical pathology and genomic medicine at Houston Methodist, concurs. "We don’t yet know if the same benefits might extend to other mRNA vaccines, or vaccination in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, certain other vaccines have shown some efficacy in studies, according to Dr. Goldberg:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, for example, is an established immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and is known to induce 'trained immunity,' a process that enhances the responsiveness of the immune system to tumor cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines such as HPV and hepatitis B are specifically designed to prevent virus-induced cancers, but COVID-19 vaccines are not in this category."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines like influenza and pneumococcus have also been studied for their potential to modulate immune responses in cancer patients, but there is no consistent evidence that they directly inhibit tumor growth or metastasis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/when-to-see-doctor-vaccine-side-effects-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:These Are the Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;These Are the Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are Other Benefits of the COVID Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us remind you: It is prime season for COVID, colds and flu. Protect yourself! "The best evidence supports that COVID-19 vaccination prevents severe disease, hospitalization and death," Dr. Long says. "It can also decrease your risk of developing long COVID, prevent infection and may reduce viral load by shortening the length of illness and symptoms if you are infected."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, just to reiterate one more time: No, the COVID vaccine doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; cancer, despite some non-science-backed conversations in the news right now. "So far, we have not seen any evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused an increase in cancer rates," Dr. Yorio says. "During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there was a big drop in cancer incidence because people were not getting screened as frequently or going to doctors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an expected rise in the next few years in cancer incidence due to the lack of diagnosis in 2020, he explains. "Again, this was not due to vaccines but rather a lack of testing during the pandemic. A study like this is actually showing a potential survival benefit to the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with advanced cancer. And, while there are patients who do have some side effects from vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccine is still thought to be a very safe vaccine overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-thing-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists-fall-2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: The One Thing Cardiologists Are Begging You to Do for Your Heart Health This Fall and Winter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: The One Thing Cardiologists Are Begging You to Do for Your Heart Health This Fall and Winter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthtrackrx.com/for-practitioners/meet-steven-goldberg-md-mba-chief-medical-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-researcher/search-researcher-directory/zihai-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.houstonmethodist.org/en/persons/s-wesley-long" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. S.

The UK &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, houses retinal and health data from more than 500,000 volunteers, giving scientists an unprecedented window into how subtle eye features mirror the body’s overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-oculomics-the-basics"&gt;Understanding oculomics – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting-edge technology used in the nascent field of oculomics allows scientists and doctors to uncover signs of heart disease, diabetes, kidney issues, and even neurological disorders – all from a quick, noninvasive eye scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-that-the-eyes-retina-can-reconnect-itself-to-maintain-vision/"&gt;human retina&lt;/a&gt; is an extension of the brain and shares blood vessels with other vital organs. This means tiny changes in the retina’s structure or color can signal bigger problems elsewhere in the body, long before symptoms appear elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced AI algorithms analyze high-resolution images of the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels to detect patterns far too subtle for the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-eyes-retina-sync-everything-they-see-before-sending-visual-signals-to-the-brain/"&gt;human eye&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These AI systems can measure vessel width, nerve fiber thickness, pigmentation, and even microstructural changes in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining ocular data with genetic, lifestyle, and clinical information, AI used in oculomics can create what researchers call a “digital eyeprint” – a personal health signature that reflects how well your body is functioning as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-retinal-link-to-systemic-disease"&gt;Retinal link to systemic disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Dr. Tien Yin Wong at the &lt;a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Singapore National Eye Centre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke NUS Medical School&lt;/a&gt; (SNEC). His research centers on retinal imaging, artificial intelligence, and how ocular clues relate to systemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retina, a thin light-sensing layer at the back of the eye, exposes tiny blood vessels and nerve tissue with uncommon clarity. Those are two organ systems that usually cannot be examined directly without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oculomics connects small changes in retinal structure and blood flow to patterns seen in the heart, brain, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oculomics-and-ai"&gt;Oculomics and AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep-learning study trained on 284,335 patients showed that retinal photographs can estimate common risk factors such as age and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also predicted the likelihood of a major cardiac event within five years – with performance comparable to standard calculators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientific-discoveries-machine-learning/"&gt;Deep learning&lt;/a&gt;, a machine-learning method that identifies patterns from large datasets, excels at finding subtle image features that humans miss. It weighs vessel width, twists, and textures, then converts them into a composite risk score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-clues-in-every-eye-photo"&gt;Health clues in every eye photo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-country system used retinal photos to estimate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;coronary artery calcium&lt;/a&gt; – calcium buildup in heart arteries that indicates plaque burden – and stratified cardiovascular risk without a CT scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach offered a low-cost, noninvasive way to identify who might need more intensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate algorithm detected &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-identifies-early-stage-alzheimers-with-90-percent-accuracy/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; from retinal photographs in a multicenter sample. The model captured disease-linked features in the macula and microvasculature while standardizing results across sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team reported a retinal age-gap biomarker that correlated with mortality risk. When the predicted retinal age exceeded a person’s actual age, risk increased modestly but consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-joins-primary-care"&gt;AI joins primary care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s decision permits the marketing of a novel artificial intelligence technology that can be used in a primary care doctor’s office,” said Dr. Malvina Eydelman, an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; device director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators have started to permit autonomous tools that interpret retinal images in primary care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That early green light focused on diabetic retinopathy, but it set a clear precedent. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-imaging-traces-humans-view/"&gt;Autonomous AI&lt;/a&gt;, software that can make a clinical call without human oversight, could triage patients where specialists are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oculomics-still-has-limitations"&gt;Oculomics still has limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clearest successes so far lie in high-burden conditions with well-defined biological signatures in the eye. Heart risk, cognitive decline, diabetes, and kidney stress all leave detectable traces in vessel shape or retinal layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limits still matter. Generalizability – the ability of a model to perform reliably across new clinics and populations – can falter when cameras, image quality, or patient backgrounds differ from the training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians should treat oculomics outputs like any other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt;, a measurable signal that reflects disease risk. A positive result may prompt follow-up tests, not an instant diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False alarms and misses will happen, especially at the edges. That is why teams are validating models prospectively, recalibrating thresholds, and combining image signals with routine vitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-as-health-sensors"&gt;Eyes as health sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-tissue-spinach-leaves/"&gt;microvasculature&lt;/a&gt; – the body’s smallest blood vessels that carry oxygen – is visible in every retinal image, offering a clear snapshot of vascular health throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern cameras now make that window easy to access: a 30-second, noninvasive photo can be taken in a primary care clinic, a pharmacy, or even by mobile teams during community screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portable imaging systems and home-based vision tools are extending that reach even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As datasets expand, foundation models – large pre-trained AI systems that can adapt to many tasks – are expected to improve stability and reduce the need for manual labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is precision prevention. By translating subtle eye signals into actionable health insights, oculomics could help match each patient to the right “next step,” whether that means starting a statin, investigating cognitive decline, or tightening glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946225000230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress in Retinal and Eye Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:15:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOSTByRFlkTzVHMzNXTVFRRzFsTTNVeWp3QVQ0SjJPMzIxWjltazZ2SHhFUUYxTzNsRHhKdVhCODgweUh1RVZ1MWdHdzlqb2FuVVlLS2tHUUlDQmY3cDRzVzdQTXY1WmpiYl9tMzdkWFFCMzRCWHpOUTl4bG03MFZwRF91ZGxlMzJvVjZqcUt0UGNvZWNQZnZIeElIcEphMGRBcTZiWkFvbDRSTjFMdXNPYmFJdlY5MnM</guid></item><item><title>加拿大战胜了麻疹和麻疹；病毒在1998年消除后流行- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/canada-fought-measles-and-measles-won-virus-now-endemic-after-1998-elimination/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said in a press briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbosa was optimistic that Canada could regain its elimination status. He highlighted that such setbacks have happened before. “In 2018 and 2019, Venezuela and Brazil temporarily lost their elimination status following large outbreaks,” Barbosa noted. “Thanks to coordinated action by governments, civil society, and regional cooperation, those outbreaks were contained, and the Region of the Americas regained its measles-free status in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;the Public Health Agency of Canada released a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming that it received notification from PAHO that it had lost its measles elimination status, while reporting that it is already getting to work on earning it back. “PHAC is collaborating with the PAHO and working with federal, provincial, territorial, and community partners to implement coordinated actions—focused on improving vaccination coverage, strengthening data sharing, enabling better overall surveillance efforts, and providing evidence-based guidance,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Canada isn’t the only country facing an uphill battle against measles—the most infectious virus known to humankind. Outbreaks and sustained spread are also active in the US and Mexico. To date, the US has documented at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,618 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the year, while Mexico has tallied at least &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/1036453/INFORME_DIARIO_SARAMPION_20251107.pdf"&gt;5,185&lt;/a&gt;. Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have ongoing outbreaks, PAHO reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of November 7, PAHO has collected reports of 12,593 confirmed measles cases from 10 countries, but approximately 95 percent of them are in Canada, Mexico, and the US. That total is a 30-fold increase compared to 2024, PAHO notes, and the rise has led to at least 28 deaths: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PAHO used Canada’s loss as a call to action not just in the northern country, but the rest of the region. “Every case we prevent, every outbreak we stop saves lives, protects families, and makes communities healthier,” Barbosa said. “Today, rather than lamenting the loss of a regional status, we call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases—reaching every corner of the Americas. As a Region, we have eliminated measles twice. We can do it a third time.”&lt;/p&gt;

"Now the hard work begins of teaching clinicians how to do this, how to have nuanced discussions with their patients, how to write the prescriptions.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more than two decades, the Food and Drug Administration has warned women about the potential risks of using estrogen to treat menopause symptoms. And that's because early studies showed an increased risk of endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders and breast cancer. Well, those warnings are going away, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary led the way on that decision, and he's here with me in studio now. Thanks for coming by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTY MAKARY: Great to be with you, Juana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: So, I mean, this black box warning that we're talking about, it's been in place on all estrogen treatments for more than two decades, since back in 2003. The timing - why remove it now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Well, the fear machine did start in 2003, after a 2002 study that really hit the airwaves in the media with a big splash, scaring women out of hormone replacement therapy in the postmenopausal setting. Up to 1 in 4 Americans were taking it. Women lived longer and felt better. But then it got deemed a carcinogen based on this study. It turns out when the study results were finally released after the media announcement, there was no statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer. There was a lower rate of breast cancer in the estrogen-only group. And so it ends up being very nuanced. And the cardiovascular benefits are profound when hormone replacement therapy is started within 10 years of the onset of menopause. So there is some nuance here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: But unfortunately, the fear machine has dominated the field, and women have been talked out of it. They've been denied or never offered hormone replacement therapy despite the profound short-term and long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Well, let's talk about that for a second, because there is a lot of nuance here. Just spell out plainly for us some of the benefits of hormone therapy as you see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. So starting hormone replacement therapy around the time of menopause not only can alleviate the short-term symptoms of menopause - that is the hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, weight gain, difficulty sleeping...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: ...Pain with sexual activity. There are 50-plus different symptoms, and every woman experiences them differently. You know, we were taught at medical school that some women have symptoms, but they're usually mild and last just a couple years - not true. Eighty-plus percent of women have symptoms. The average duration is eight years, and for many women, it is severe. They are debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term benefits are remarkable and massively misunderstood. It reduces the risk of bone fractures later in life by 50- to 60%. That's a New England Journal study. It reduces cognitive decline by up to 64%. In one study, reduced the risk of Alzheimer's by 35%, and there are cardiovascular benefits when it's started within 10 years of the onset of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Does it matter if a woman is taking a pill, which is systemic, or using a cream, which is a local treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: So there are pills. There are patches. There are creams and gels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: And so all of these products had a black box warning from the FDA as a part of this pile-on, as a part of this bandwagon thinking in 2002, 2003. We are removing those and putting the nuances of the risks in the package insert. And the idea is to get better information in front of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Spell out some of these risks for us, because there are still risks associated with hormone replacement therapy, is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. When started more than 10 years after the onset of menopause, then you actually see some of these risks that are - have been attributed to all hormone replacement therapy products. And that's probably because the body naturally is making estrogen, and that increases nitric oxide. It keeps the blood vessels soft and the walls soft and healthy and dilated. And so when it started such that there's not a gap where your body is without it, then there are cardiovascular benefits where the reduction in heart disease has been noted to be 35 - 30- to 50%. That is a 30- to 50% reduction in heart disease, and in a study in circulation two years ago, a 48% decline in heart attack deaths. And so that is because of the effect of estrogen. So if it's started too late, the blood vessels are narrowing and the theory is that they're hardening and that aging and atherosclerosis can then result in a situation that is prone for a blood clot...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: ...With hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Commissioner, are there women who should not be using hormone therapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yes. Many doctors do identify some contraindications - a woman with an underlying risk for blood clots, a woman with active breast cancer or past breast cancer, depending on the practice style of the physician. But the vast majority of women who go through menopause, which is about 2 million women a year, are great candidates for hormone replacement therapy. If a woman has a uterus, it's important for them to also take progesterone to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and possibly uterine cancer. But women who have been taking this for a long time have reported tremendous benefits, and they're talking about it on social media now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: So there is a bit of an awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: I do want to ask you about the process here. Because in preparing to remove the black box warning, there's usually a formal, very detailed process. Things seemed to play out differently this time. Tell us why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. We're getting things done. In this administration, at the FDA, we're getting things done. They were talking about removing or banning a food dye for 35 years before I got to the FDA. Within weeks, we took action to remove nine petroleum-based food dyes from the food supply. That's all artificial dyes. In this case, we are responding to a petition that was filed in 2016. It was basically blown off. It was refiled in 2025. We held an expert panel. We didn't go through the long, bureaucratic, expensive process of bringing in conflicted experts to talk about a product. We brought in a range of diverse medical experts who passionately made the case for stopping this fear machine by removing the black box warnings around cardiovascular disease, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: I mean, over the last several years in our society, I don't have to tell you this, but there has been this increasing recognition of the health challenges, the very real challenges that women face during menopause, and you and I were talking about the nuance in this conversation earlier. Do you worry at all that by removing this black box warning, that it might result in the pendulum tipping the other way, and there's now going to be an overuse of hormone therapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Well, tragically, over the last 23 years, 50 million women have been denied or talked out of hormone replacement therapy in part because of the fear machine that it - hormone replacement therapy is a carcinogen, it causes breast cancer. We can argue whether or not the old type of progesterone used, called MPA, in that original study may have slightly increased the risk of breast cancer in women who took that MPA. But no clinical trial has ever found that it increases the risk of breast cancer mortality. And if it did, that harm would be far eclipsed by the profound cardiovascular benefits. You know, early on in the 1920s, Mayo Clinic researchers noted that young girls who had their ovaries removed went on to have heart disease in their 30s and 40s, suggesting a profound cardiovascular protective effect. And so that's the nuance conversation that people need to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: We've been speaking with FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, coming in to talk to us about the FDA's decision to remove black box warnings for estrogen treatments for menopause. Thank you so much for coming by our studios today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Great to be with you, Juana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists have found enough evidence to firmly say that short-term fasting does not cause a dip in mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.0"&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;The idea that fasting interferes with mental performance probably stems from how we feel when hungry—tired, distracted, and irritable,” explains &lt;a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/d-moreau" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/d-moreau" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Moreau, PhD" data-node-id="1.2" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;David Moreau, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and coauthor of the study. “It’s natural to assume that those sensations reflect poorer cognitive function. Some early studies supported this view, but when you pool the evidence, those effects largely disappear.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This might sound like great news if you’ve been curious about intermittent fasting, but was nervous about it giving you &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a65372839/is-it-brain-fogor-something-else/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a65372839/is-it-brain-fogor-something-else/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain fog" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;. But not all fasting is created equal.

Read on to find out more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="short-term-vs-long-term-fasting-whats-better-for-cognition" data-node-id="4" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Short-Term vs Long-Term Fasting: What's Better for Cognition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Researchers analyzed 71 studies that recruited nearly 3,500 people who were either fasting or had recently eaten. They compared their cognitive performance, including memory recall, decision-making, response time, and accuracy. Most of the fasting periods were short-term, lasting on average around 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers discovered no meaningful difference in cognition in people who did short-term fasts and those who recently ate. “The brain has built-in mechanisms to stay fueled and functional, even in the absence of food—a reassuring message for anyone who practices intermittent fasting,” Moreau says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now this wasn't the case for people who did longer fasts that lasted over 12 hours. For this group, the researchers found small dips in their cognitive performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Fasts that last longer than 24 hours may negatively affect cognitive performance,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, consulting nutritionist and former spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. But, like the study showed, Angelone says short-term intermittent fasting can be safe mentally for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="but-what-if-you-do-feel-unfocused-when-fasting" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;But What if You &lt;em data-node-id="9.0.1"&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="9.0.2"&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; Feel Unfocused When Fasting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now the study showed no actual difference in cognitive performance in people &lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to short-term fasting. But if you're just starting out, your body needs time to adapt. &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab, says it could be one reason why you might feel mentally off when you first start fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It’s harder for people who never fast,” he explains. “If you don’t eat and you usually eat on a consistent schedule, you might be very hungry—that’s mentally distracting.” People with metabolic conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63333087/thriving-with-diabetes-cgm-marathon-long-bike-abe-ngoma/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63333087/thriving-with-diabetes-cgm-marathon-long-bike-abe-ngoma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; may find that intermittent fasting impacts their cognition, too, Moreau says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-how-does-fasting-affect-the-brain" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;So How Does Fasting Affect the Brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Fasting does impact your brain—just not in your cognitive abilities (which is how you think, learn, remember, and judge things). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Under normal eating conditions, Moreau says it mainly relies on glucose stored as glycogen. Cue fasting. When you skip a meal, you lose that source of fuel. However, Moreau says the brain is "remarkably adaptable" and has a backup plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“When glycogen levels fall during fasting, the body begins converting fat into ketone bodies, which the brain can use as an efficient alternative fuel," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Your brain metabolism is prioritized over other parts of your body so, if you fast, your brain gets fed before your muscles," adds &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, DO" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. And that's what allows your cognition to stay steady over short-term fasting, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This flexibility helps ensure that your brain gets a steady energy supply, even when food is scarce, Moreau says. “In evolutionary terms, it makes sense: Our ancestors needed to stay alert and think clearly while seeking food, not become sluggish when hungry,” he says. “That capacity for cognitive stability likely persists today.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-cmvt2k ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

			&lt;p&gt;A common type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV) could be more dangerous than we thought. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="180861" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as beta-HPV, was thought in rare cases to contribute to skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="180861" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by worsening UV damage, but a recent study suggests it can actually hijack the body's cells to directly drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fresh conclusions came from a study of a 34-year-old woman who sought medical help for &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma"&gt;cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; (cSCC) on her forehead. Her tumors were repeatedly growing back, even after immunotherapy and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/modified-herpes-virus-found-to-shrink-deadly-skin-cancers-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Modified Herpes Virus Found to Shrink Deadly Skin Cancers in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer genetic analysis revealed something surprising: the beta-HPV had actually integrated itself into the DNA of the woman's tumor, where it was producing viral proteins that helped the cancer thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, beta-HPV had never been found to integrate into cellular DNA, let alone actively maintain a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Andrea Lisco from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman who was the subject of this study had an inherited immune disorder, one that prevented her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; from attacking HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="ZAP70 proteins" class="wp-image-169952 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart-600x349.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues with the ZAP70 protein were key to the research. (Ye et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tests revealed that the woman's immune system could still repair DNA damage from UV radiation – the typical cause of cSCC – the impairment of her T cells meant the beta-HPV could invade her skin cells and trigger the formation of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he immunocompromised woman was also being treated for other HPV-related illnesses, including warts on the skin and in the mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cause of her condition was discovered, the patient received a bone marrow &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt; to replace her dysfunctional T cells with healthy ones. This cleared up the aggressive skin cancer and her other HPV-caused issues, none of which returned during a three-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists, and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by no means minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sunlight-can-still-damage-skin-through-a-closed-window-heres-how"&gt;the role of UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; as a cause of skin cancer, but it also shows that other factors are at work. In rare cases like this, normally benign &lt;span&gt;viruses&lt;/span&gt; can have devastating effects in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That emphasizes the need for targeted, personalized &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; that may well be more effective than conventional and generic approaches. It's likely that the woman involved in this study is far from the only one with this set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason to be hopeful could come from progress against a related disease. Alpha-HPV is known as the cause of many cervical and throat cancers, and widespread vaccination against the virus has resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;drastic drop&lt;/a&gt; in deaths from those cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single, universal cure for cancer remains elusive, we are continuing to see steadily improving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;survival and recovery rates&lt;/a&gt; across many cancer types, including cSCC – something this new research should also help with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2502114"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects nearly 40 million individuals globally, resulting in a gradual loss of memory and independence. Despite extensive research over the past decades, no treatments have been found that can halt or reverse the progression of this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In AD, a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction is the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/protein+tau/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein tau&lt;/a&gt;. Tau typically plays a crucial role in keeping the internal structure of neurons stable, much like train tracks help trains stay on course. However, in some diseases, tau undergoes abnormal modifications and starts to aggregate, disrupting this transport system, thus leading to neuronal damage and subsequent memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has reported a new mechanism by which boosting the natural metabolite NAD⁺ can protect the brain from the degeneration associated with AD. Their paper, titled "NAD⁺ reverses Alzheimer's neurological deficits via regulating differential alternative RNA splicing of EVA1C," is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady9811" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is led by Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang from the University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital, Norway, in collaboration with Professor Oscar Junhong Luo from Jinan University, China, and Associate Professor Joana M. Silva from the University of Minho, Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How NAD⁺ supports brain health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD⁺ (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide+adenine+dinucleotide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&lt;/a&gt;, oxidized form) is a vital metabolite involved in energy metabolism and neuronal resilience in the body. It normally declines with age and especially in various neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preliminary studies have shown that supplementation with NAD⁺ precursors, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide+riboside/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide riboside&lt;/a&gt; (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), can offer therapeutic benefits in AD animal models and early clinical trials. However, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; behind these benefits remain largely unclear," first author Alice Ruixue Ai says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study reveals that NAD⁺ works through a previously unidentified RNA-splicing pathway. This pathway is regulated by a protein called EVA1C, which plays an essential role in the process of RNA splicing. RNA splicing allows a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+gene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single gene&lt;/a&gt; to produce multiple isoforms of a protein, and one isoform may show distinctive effects from the other isoforms. Its dysregulation is one of the most recently acknowledged risk factors for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that when NAD⁺ levels are increased, EVA1C helps correct mistakes in RNA splicing. This restoration process improves the function of hundreds of genes, many crucial for brain health, which can help reverse the neurodegenerative damage caused by tau.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Cross-species validation from worms to mice to the human brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the impact of this mechanism, the researchers used a comprehensive approach that included computer predictions and validation in different animal models, including worms, mice, as well as human brain samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They first identified age-related changes in RNA splicing in a specific type of worm. They found that adding NAD⁺ could correct the splicing issues caused by the toxic tau protein. In mice with tau-related mutations, NAD⁺ supplements improved RNA splicing, restored brain function, and enhanced memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Notably, we found when the EVA1C gene was knocked down, these benefits were lost, confirming that EVA1C is essential for NAD⁺-mediated neuroprotection," Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligned with these animal studies, EVA1C levels were significantly reduced in brain cells from people with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using AI to uncover the mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further investigate how EVA1C works, the team used an AI-driven platform to predict how proteins interact with one another, analyzing structural, sequential, and evolutionary data from millions of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis revealed that NAD⁺ promotes a specific form of EVA1C that efficiently binds to essential proteins, which are central to protein folding and clearance. This connection links metabolic homeostasis, RNA splicing processes and protein management, three processes that are critically impaired in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Towards new Alzheimer's treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By establishing the connection between NAD⁺ and EVA1C, this study lays the groundwork for the development of new therapies and optimization of NAD⁺ augmentation strategies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We propose that maintaining NAD⁺ levels could help preserve neuronal identity and delay &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for combination treatments to enhance RNA splicing," Ai says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the virus certainly can be gruesome, and often painful, most people do recover at home with the help of symptomatic care such as fever-reducing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no specific medications for hand, foot, and mouth, and since it’s a viral illness, “no antibiotics are going to get rid of it,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your children do get sick, you should “try to avoid spreading it to anyone else,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is sick with hand, foot, and mouth should isolate from others so they don’t pass on the virus, while also hydrating and eating enough nutrients. The virus tends to last for about a week in most people, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having more severe symptoms, like if you’re having a lot of ulcers in your mouth, it may take up to 10 to 14 days to resolve fully,” Thomas added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people require additional care, though. If you aren’t able to hydrate, or keep your sick child hydrated, you should seek medical care, Thomas noted. The same is true if whoever is sick isn’t able to eat enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duchon added, “If you’ve had hand, foot, and mouth and afterwards, or towards the end of the illness, you’re feeling really, really tired or having trouble breathing, those are things that are really serious to look for that can mean that the heart has been affected. That’s a very rare but serious complication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand-washing is a good way to protect yourself from catching this virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with anxiety disorders have lower levels of choline in their brains, according to research from UC Davis Health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03206-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, analyzed data from 25 studies. The researchers compared the levels of neurometabolites—chemicals produced during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain metabolism&lt;/a&gt;—in 370 people with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anxiety+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt; to 342 people without anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the level of choline—an essential nutrient—was about 8% lower in those with anxiety disorders. The evidence for low choline was especially consistent in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps control thinking, emotions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first meta-analysis to show a chemical pattern in the brain in anxiety disorders," said Jason Smucny, co-author and an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. "It suggests nutritional approaches—like appropriate choline supplementation—may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choline (pronounced KOE lean) is vital for cell membranes and brain functions like memory, mood regulation and muscle control. The body makes a small amount, but most must come from food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety disorders affect about 30% of adults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Maddock, senior author of the study, is a psychiatrist and research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. He is also a researcher at the UC Davis Imaging Research Center, which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to study brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maddock spent decades in clinical practice treating patients with anxiety disorders and conducting research on these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults. They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment," Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Panic disorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social anxiety disorders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phobias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Brain interactions affect anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are linked to how different parts of the brain—like the amygdala, which influences our sense of safety or danger, and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in planning and decision-making—respond to stress or potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are also linked to imbalances in neurotransmitters. For example, norepinephrine—part of the body's "fight-or-flight" response—is often elevated in anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the brain can tell the difference between potential threats that are manageable and those that are not. In anxiety disorders, manageable threats can seem overwhelming. For example, with generalized anxiety disorder, people worry excessively about everyday things and have trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noninvasive technique identifies chemical levels in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maddock and Smucny have spent years studying brain chemistry and its association with mental illness using a noninvasive medical imaging technique known as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or 1H-MRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measurements are made using an MRI machine. 1H-MRS uses the magnetic fields and radio waves of an MRI to analyze the body. However, instead of creating an image of the body, it provides data about the chemicals that are present in the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maddock had noticed low levels of choline in his &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/4002137" target="_blank"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; of patients with panic disorder. He decided to conduct a meta-analysis with Smucny. And even though they thought they would find low choline, he was still surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An 8% lower amount doesn't sound like that much, but in the brain it's significant," Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;



                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Most Americans don't get enough choline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think the high fight-or-flight activity experienced in anxiety disorders may increase choline demand, lowering its levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't know yet if increasing choline in the diet will help reduce anxiety. More research will be needed," Maddock said. He cautions that people with anxiety should not self-medicate with excessive choline supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he notes a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; is essential for all aspects of health, including mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Someone with an anxiety disorder might want to look at their diet and see whether they are getting the recommended daily amount of choline. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2015.1080127" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that most people in the U.S., including children, don't get the recommended daily amount," Maddock said. "Some forms of omega-3 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+acids/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, like those found in salmon, may be especially good sources for supplying choline to the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other foods rich in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/choline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt; include beef liver, eggs (particularly the yolk), beef, chicken, fish, soybeans and milk, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

And it shouldn’t interfere with other medications or health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing aside, there are just a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/ingredients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:active ingredients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;active ingredients&lt;/a&gt; found in cold and flu medicines. But which ones are best for which symptoms? Common symptoms are broken down in the table and subsequent sections below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A table listing symptoms, its equivalent medicine and its active ingredients and onset, and what's good to know about each. - GoodRx&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fever and aches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two OTC options to help bring down a fever: &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/acetaminophen/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acetaminophen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/nsaids/nsaid-list" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NSAIDs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NSAIDs&lt;/a&gt;), such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ibuprofen/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ibuprofen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; (Motrin, Advil). Both can provide relief for headaches and achy muscles, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/aspirin/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aspirin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aspirin&lt;/a&gt; is also an NSAID option, but it should be &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/aspirin/reyes-syndrome-and-its-link-to-aspirin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoided by people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avoided by people&lt;/a&gt; under age 19. That’s because it’s linked to a dangerous condition called Reye’s syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications are available on their own for fever and minor aches. They can also be found in a variety of combination products for multisymptom relief. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/children-s-tylenol/tylenol-dosage-for-kids" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Both acetaminophen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Both acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/childrens-health/childrens-ibuprofen-dosage-how-much-is-safe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ibuprofen have dosage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ibuprofen have dosage&lt;/a&gt; instructions for children based on their &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/weight-based-medication-dosage" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:body weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple dosage forms are available for each medication, including capsules and tablets, liquids, and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/what-is-suppository" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suppositories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;suppositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen takes about &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/tylenol/how-long-does-tylenol-take-to-work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:15 to 60 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;15 to 60 minutes&lt;/a&gt; to kick in, depending on the product. Ibuprofen can take about &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ibuprofen/how-long-does-ibuprofen-take-to-work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 minutes to 2 hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;20 minutes to 2 hours&lt;/a&gt;, with the liquid-filled gel capsules working the fastest. There is also the option to alternate products. This means if acetaminophen doesn’t provide relief, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/nsaids/is-it-safe-to-take-tylenol-acetaminophen-with-advil-or-motrin-ibuprofen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a dose of ibuprofen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a dose of ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; can be taken a few hours later.

If taking a few different products for your symptoms, check to make sure not to double up. The same is true with NSAIDs like ibuprofen, which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/nsaids/nsaids-ibuprofen-bad-liver-kidneys" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidney damage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kidney damage&lt;/a&gt; and stomach ulcers &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ibuprofen/how-much-is-too-much-advil-ibuprofen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:if a person takes too much;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;if a person takes too much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tylenol and NSAIDs aren’t safe for everyone. Those who take medications or have other health conditions should check with a healthcare professional first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cough&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/dextromethorphan/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dextromethorphan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dextromethorphan&lt;/a&gt; (Delsym) and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/guaifenesin/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guaifenesin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guaifenesin&lt;/a&gt; (Mucinex) are common go-to &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/whats-the-best-cough-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:remedies for cough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;remedies for cough&lt;/a&gt;. There &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7061814/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t much evidence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t much evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they work, but some people find relief from taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant. It’s thought to work by blocking cough reflexes. This may be helpful for a dry, hacking cough that doesn’t produce mucus. Dextromethorphan usually starts working &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Dextromethorphan#section=Absorption-Distribution-and-Excretion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:within 15 to 30 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;within 15 to 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It’s supposed to loosen up and thin the mucus in the airways of those with a wet cough. This can help make coughing up the mucus easier. But &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.relieving-a-cough.ug1887" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drinking water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; can have a similar effect. Guaifenesin can start kicking in &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/expectorant-vs-mucolytic#when-they-start-working" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:within 30 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;within 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dextromethorphan and guaifenesin are available on their own and in combination products. Sometimes they can be found together, as with &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/mucinex-dm/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mucinex DM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mucinex DM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that OTC cough medications can have &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/should-you-give-kids-medicine-coughs-and-colds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:serious side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; in young children &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/childrens-health/toddler-otc-cold-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:under age 4;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;under age 4&lt;/a&gt;. So, it’s best to check with their pediatrician about your options. Medication-free alternatives, such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cough/does-honey-help-cough" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:honey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/botulism/what-is-botulism-and-why-is-it-deadly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:12 months old;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;12 months old&lt;/a&gt;) or a cool-mist &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/respiratory/cool-vs-warm-mist-humidifier" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:humidifier;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;humidifier&lt;/a&gt;, may be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sinus congestion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few options for a stuffy nose. First, consider nonprescription oral and nasal decongestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decongestant nasal sprays typically kick in the fastest — within 2 to 10 minutes. But they shouldn’t be used for &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/nasal-congestion/rebound-congestion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than three days;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more than three days&lt;/a&gt; because symptoms could come back worse and be tougher to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudoephedrine &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/alpha-agonists/sudafed-vs-sudafed-pe-whats-the-difference" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:works better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;works better&lt;/a&gt; of the two oral options. It typically starts working &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/how-long-take-oral-decongestants-sudafed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:within 30 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;within 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. But it is kept &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/otc/whats-behind-the-counter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:behind the pharmacy counter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;behind the pharmacy counter&lt;/a&gt;. It can also cause sleeping problems if &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/nasal-congestion/decongestant-mistakes-and-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:taken in the evening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;taken in the evening&lt;/a&gt;. Oral phenylephrine is commonly found in combination products, but it has been &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/phenylephrine-pe/phenylephrine-alternatives" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found to be ineffective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;found to be ineffective&lt;/a&gt;. So even though it’s still on pharmacy shelves, it may not help symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that decongestants can make certain health conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/side-effects/medications-that-can-raise-your-blood-pressure#decongestants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, worse. Check with a healthcare professional before taking one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Runny nose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/antihistamines/drugs-list" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Antihistamines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Antihistamines&lt;/a&gt; may be helpful for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3121056/#sec16:~:text=1%2C32-,Antihistamines,-Oral%20second%20generation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drying up sinuses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drying up sinuses&lt;/a&gt; for those who have a runny nose.

Some of these medications can have risks in young children, too. Check with a healthcare professional before taking one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Which cold and flu medicines are best for nighttime?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/how-to-sleep-with-cold" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:feeling sick and trying to go to sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;feeling sick and trying to go to sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the last thing anyone wants is something that will keep them awake. But certain ingredients in cold and flu medicines may do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, avoid taking daytime cold and flu medications at night. They may include ingredients that are stimulating and can &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/insomnia/could-your-medication-be-causing-insomnia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interfere with sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nighttime” products, on the other hand, may contain ingredients that &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/side-effects/prescription-make-you-tired" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:make you sleepy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;make you sleepy&lt;/a&gt;. For those who are having difficulty sleeping, this can be a welcome side effect. Examples include antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and doxylamine. Dextromethorphan can also &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/dextromethorphan/dextromethorphan-side-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cause drowsiness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cause drowsiness&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that some products contain alcohol, which may not be ideal for certain people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists can be a good resource for those who are unsure of when to take a specific product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips for picking the best cold and flu medication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, this story has covered some of the basics to help navigate the best OTC cold and flu medicine options. But there are a few more things to know before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Many OTC cold and flu medications have the same or similar ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, there are just a handful of ingredients found in OTC cold and flu medications. This may be surprising given how many different products are found on pharmacy shelves. What’s more, many products are the same or very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=a3523aa3-9ed1-472d-9986-438440d0a3eb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mucinex Fast-Max Cold, Flu, &amp;amp; Sore Throat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mucinex Fast-Max Cold, Flu, &amp;amp; Sore Throat&lt;/a&gt; contains the exact same active ingredients as &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=fe7eeb71-e219-4c84-ac06-98c3a40b14dc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mucinex Fast-Max Cold &amp;amp; Flu (All-in-One);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mucinex Fast-Max Cold &amp;amp; Flu (All-in-One)&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is judging the product on the label alone, they might pick one over the other based on how it’s named. Taking different products with the same ingredient could result in the person taking too much of that particular medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a product, try to pay less attention to the marketing. Look at the &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/otc/medicine-label" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:OTC medication label;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;OTC medication label&lt;/a&gt; instead. It’ll list the active ingredients, amounts, and symptoms the product is intended to treat. This can help avoid duplicating ingredients. And the shopper may even find a better deal for the same combination of medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Generics and store brands can help save money&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/medication-basics/brand-vs-generic-drugs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Generic medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Generic medication&lt;/a&gt; names like dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine aren’t always commonly known. People may be more familiar with their branded products — Delsym and Benadryl. But when people buy the brand, they’re really just paying for the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generics work just as well as their brand-name counterparts. Store-brand (also called private-label) versions are also a great option. And they can save some money, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with the generic names, ask a pharmacist. They can help select the right product to meet needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. People may be taking more medication than necessary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to avoid throwing the kitchen sink at &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/cold-vs-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cold or flu symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cold or flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Especially with OTC combination products, people may end up taking more medication than they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people may keep a combination product like &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/nyquil/what-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NyQuil Cold and Flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NyQuil Cold and Flu&lt;/a&gt; on hand for when they get sick. It contains acetaminophen, as well as medications for cough and a runny nose. But if someone doesn’t have a fever or aches, they’ll end up taking acetaminophen — even though they don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combination products can be convenient. But taking unnecessary medications can increase the risk of side effects, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/safety/drug-interactions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interactions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interactions&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Be sure to check product ingredients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Know when to consult with a doctor about cold and flu medicine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to know when to skip OTC cold and flu medicines altogether. In some cases, people are better off speaking to their primary care provider or another healthcare professional. A prescription may be needed for cold and flu medications. Or more targeted treatments, such as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/antiviral-medications-for-the-flu-options" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu antivirals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu antivirals&lt;/a&gt;, that aren’t available OTC, may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should talk to a healthcare professional about their symptoms if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/takingcare/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:age 65 or older;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;age 65 or older&lt;/a&gt; and think they have the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/pregnant.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pregnant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who’s sick is an &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/flu-in-infants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:infant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/signs-of-flu-in-toddlers#getting-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:child;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt; under age 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/autoimmune/do-i-have-a-weak-immune-system" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weakened immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weakened immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They take &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/drugs/side-effects/medications-that-weaken-your-immune-system" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; that weaken the immune system, such as prednisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve been taking OTC cold and flu medicines for one week and don’t feel any better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their symptoms initially improve and then worsen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/self-care#when-to-get-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more severe cold or flu symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more severe cold or flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequently asked questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which cold and flu medicines should people avoid taking together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold and flu medicines that contain the same ingredients or ingredients that belong to the same drug class together shouldn’t be combined. For example, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine shouldn’t be taken together since they’re &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/antihistamines/interactions#other-antihistamines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:both antihistamines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;both antihistamines&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the case for taking multiple NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which cold medications work the fastest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which cold medications work the fastest depends on which symptoms are being treated. For congestion, decongestant nasal sprays &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/alpha-1-agonists/afrin-vs-sudafed#active-ingredients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:work the fastest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;work the fastest&lt;/a&gt;. For a fever, there &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/cold-symptoms/treating-sore-throat-pain-advil-tylenol-aspirin#comparing-pain-meds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t a significant difference;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t a significant difference&lt;/a&gt; between acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. And for a runny nose, nasal spray antihistamines, such as azelastine, usually &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/allergies/taking-allergy-meds-everyday#fast-acting-meds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:start working faster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;start working faster&lt;/a&gt; than oral antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dealing with cold and flu symptoms, over-the-counter (OTC) remedies may help provide some relief. Fever reducers, cough suppressants, and decongestants are common options to consider. They can be found on their own and in combination products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check a product’s ingredients before purchasing, since it’s best to avoid taking unnecessary medications. Also consider generics and store brands over brand-name products to help save money. Pharmacists can help navigate these options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu/how-to-choose-the-best-cold-and-flu-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodRx;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoodRx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 20:13:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB3RS1MZWJtZU1EekdKWXc3Sm83Zm5vLWZpakJKWjNXeFk4WlBfR0J3SXlwRGVORmV3by1CdTBRVW96em1TVnhvQko5RDdmaFVyZV9yVWxXX29Ec2phWENMcjVJazN4emdLSi1jaUJVYUdLVGhWeHQtSS1XbjRXZw</guid></item><item><title>拯救噬菌体？ PITT LAB开发病毒来对抗抗生素耐药性细菌- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/news/health-now/phages-to-the-rescue-pitt-lab-develops-viruses-to-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An antibody-like compound known on land to be exclusively to be found in camelids like alpacas, lamas, and dromedaries, could be used to treat human brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s focus were antibody-like proteins, aptly called nanobodies, whose small size allowed the scientists to treat neurological conditions in mice more effectively and with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147%2825%2900228-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, outlines the next steps towards developing nanobody treatments that are safe for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Camelid nanobodies open a new era of biologic therapies for brain disorders and revolutionize our thinking about therapeutics,” said Dr. Philippe Rondard, of &lt;em&gt;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique&lt;/em&gt; (CNRS) in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe they can form a new class of drugs between conventional antibodies and small molecules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanobodies were first discovered in the early 1990s by Belgian scientists studying the immune systems of camelids. They found that as well as making conventional antibodies, which are composed of two heavy chains and two light chains, camelids also produce antibodies with just heavy chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antigen-binding fragments of those antibodies are now known as nanobodies. They’re just one-tenth the size of conventional antibodies, and have not been found in any other mammals, say scientists, although they have been observed recently in some cartilaginous fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic approaches for diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders often centre around antibodies. The treatments that have shown some therapeutic benefits, including a few drugs for Alzheimer’s treatment, are often associated with secondary side effects, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their much smaller size, scientists say nanobodies have the potential to offer better efficacy for brain diseases with fewer side effects. In previous studies, the team has shown that nanobodies can restore behavioral deficits in mouse models of schizophrenia and other neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are highly soluble small proteins that can enter the brain passively,” said co-author Dr. Pierre-André Lafon, also of CNRS. “By contrast, small-molecule drugs that are designed to cross the blood-brain barrier are hydrophobic in nature, which limits their bioavailability, increases the risk of off-target binding, and is linked to side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDICAL INNOVATION: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Bee Stingers Inspire Superior and Comfortable Continuous Drug Delivery" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bee-stingers-serve-as-inspiration-for-superior-and-comfortable-continuous-drug-delivery/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Bee Stingers Inspire Superior and Comfortable Continuous Drug Delivery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says nanobodies are also easier than conventional antibodies to produce, purify, and engineer and can be fine-tuned to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers acknowledge that several steps need to be taken before nanobodies can be tested in human clinical trials for brain disorders. They say toxicology and long-term safety testing are essential, and the effect of chronic administration needs to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It will be necessary to obtain clinical-grade nanobodies and stable formulations that maintain activity during long-term storage and transport,” said Dr. Rondard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lafon added that his lab has already started to study these different parameters for a few brain-penetrant nanobodies and has recently shown that conditions of treatment are compatible with chronic treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

You can hear your blood pulsing in your veins. Every time he even looks at you, you feel a burst of energy. &lt;em&gt;Could it be? Am I in love? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies send signals that say, "This one could be a keeper," and it's no big surprise. But how does falling in love work exactly? Is it something we do subconsciously? Do our brains and bodies really tell us when we're in love? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 5 scientific ways to tell you’re falling in love for real:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. You catch yourself staring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/312/lucy-l-brown" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Lucy L. Brown,&lt;/a&gt; a neuroscientist and professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine who has studied the neural basis of emotion, says the eyes matter most. When you're in love, you involuntarily cannot keep your eyes off the object of your affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans naturally find &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/secrets-learn-about-someone-looking-them-in-eye"&gt;eye contact rewarding&lt;/a&gt;. Not only that, but we're physically compelled to pursue eye contact with our romantic interests. "One of the involuntary manifestations of being in love is 'mooning around' the person, having your eyes constantly fixed on a person," Dr. Brown says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/secrets-learn-about-someone-looking-them-in-eye"&gt;Psychology Reveals The 5 Secrets You Can Learn About Someone Just By Looking Them In The Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. You feel high&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-11/art-of-human-chemistry-scientific-ways-to-tell-you%E2%80%99re-falling-in-love-for-real-high.png" alt="Person feels the height of love" title="art of human chemistry scientific ways to tell you’re falling in love for real high" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;pics five via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you realize you've been hyperactively talking about your new beau, you might think you've had too much caffeine. It's actually a different drug. "Being in love is like being &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb07/morethan"&gt;high on cocaine&lt;/a&gt;," says Dr. Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the physical symptoms are the same: increased energy, increased heart rate and blood pressure (especially when you see the person), and the inability to sleep or eat. Feelings of euphoria also appear with cocaine use, as they do when in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms occur because, while the brain produces dopamine on its own, it produces even more when in love. The brain also produces &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc4911849" rel="nofollow"&gt;more of the chemical norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; when we're in love, speeding up the heart when we're nervous, as we might be upon seeing our beloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-03875-003" rel="nofollow"&gt;Some psychologist&lt;/a&gt;s actually regard love as an addiction instead of an emotion because it causes these aforementioned behaviors and because it is a "goal-oriented motivational state" like addiction. Love also activates the subcortical and cortical areas of the brain associated with drug cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/falling-love-like-being-on-this-drug-according-research"&gt;Falling In Love Is Like Being On This Drug, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. You can't keep your hands off each other&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won't just be seeking your beau visually. Just as you hunt down food when hungry, you'll actively engage in proximity-seeking behavior &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/someone-genuinely-in-love-with-you-display-these-tender-behaviors-regular-basis"&gt;when you're in love&lt;/a&gt;. This explains why grade-school flirtation often involves pushing or hair-pulling. When in love, we can't resist the urge to touch our beloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biancaacevedo.com/uploads/3/4/6/0/34607369/bianca_p_acevedo_cv_feb_8_2021.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Bianca Acevedo&lt;/a&gt;, visiting scientist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, says that when we're in love, our bodies will subconsciously lean toward each other — a physical manifestation of the brain's desire for emotional closeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/love-lust-questions-must-ask-know-for-sure"&gt;Is It Love Or Lust? 2 Questions You Must Ask To Know For Sure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. You can't stop thinking about them&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the increased dopamine levels of romantic love, people think about their romantic interests, on average, 85 percent of the day. This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-naturally-intelligent-people-do-stop-invasive-thoughts-snowballing"&gt;"intrusive thinking."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Brown, "In the early stages of romantic love, most people can't stop thinking about their beloved. The other person becomes an obsession." And this person will occupy their thoughts for what may seem like an extreme amount of time. But it's really quite normal. In fact, "If it is less than 40 percent, then it is not really intense romantic love," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of obsession, while normal if in love, is often compared to that of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/devastating-hell-living-obsessive-compulsive-disorder"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;/a&gt; When patients undergo treatment for OCD, they're provided with serotonin reuptake inhibitors to ease their obsessions. Because of this, scientists figure that the decrease in the brain's normal serotonin levels causes similar behaviors when in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/behaviors-couples-become-more-obsessed-each-other-as-they-age"&gt;4 Behaviors Of Couples Who Become More Obsessed With Each Other As They Age, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

This means we have strong feelings of romantic love for just one person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, feelings of lust are less about a specific person than they are for physical intimacy itself. When it comes to lust, the preferred relationship could be significantly shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/12383030" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to a 2002 study&lt;/a&gt;, if a person is really "in love" with their partner, the desire for emotional union will take precedence over the desire for tactile pleasure. The study also concluded that we seek physical intimacy and exclusivity with this one person because we innately hope for uninterrupted courtship and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Love is a survival system, like being hungry or being thirsty," Dr. Brown says. Our bodies seek love (to reproduce) just as they seek out food or water. Therefore, love for one person is more like a reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people won't die without love, as they would without food or water. Dr. Brown says studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-46916-001" rel="nofollow"&gt;people in relationships live longer&lt;/a&gt;; they're also usually healthier and have a greater sense of well-being. The love of friends and family is also important and can even occasionally substitute for romantic love. However, the kind of love we seek depends very much on our hormonal status, what our bodies need at a certain moment in time. But remember, it doesn't last forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the heightened emotions and general euphoria brought on by romantic love eventually fade. "You can't keep it up forever or you'll never get anything done!" laughs Dr. Brown. "It's too intense to last. Even the most intense romantic love doesn't last more than six months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't worry. As feelings of intense romantic love wane, feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/signs-healthiest-attachment-style-out-there"&gt;attachment develop&lt;/a&gt;, and that's what keeps people together for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can have just 'attachment', but it's better for the couple if there's romantic love at the start. People stay together because they remember the warm, positive feelings of having that original, romantic love." This way, couples will stay together for each other. That attachment is then transferred to their offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So love itself doesn't necessarily diminish; it just evolves. But despite all the signs and science, if you're in love, you're in love. Even Dr. Brown agrees: "You know when it happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/art-partnership-ways-be-same-team-totally-different-people"&gt;The Art Of Partnership: 6 Ways To Be On The Same Team When You’re Totally Different People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.miss-manhattan.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elyssa Goodman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer, photographer, and stylist who works primarily within the realms of culture, fashion, relationships, and music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 19:04:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNSUVWdGE5clRlRE5pZFY3Sl9MdEtjUk11WXNJTE1zRndyNHNrd2lHek1KazdLQ2p5eVhNNzVEc3BicXhMYjFmRVp1cXdrVUlKd1JRLUI0V0RCb1QxU3lmbjBWVjdocUs4ODF3Z24tcTdjWTVpR3N4Qk1ScHdFSGt4Z1JB</guid></item><item><title>为什么阿尔茨海默氏症患者会忘记心爱的人-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/alzheimers-neural-net-memory-29913/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have discovered that the heartbreaking moment when a person with Alzheimer’s no longer recognizes family may stem from the breakdown of perineuronal nets, protective structures that support social memory. In mice, the loss of these nets erased memory of familiar individuals while sparing object memory, mirroring early human symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using MMP inhibitors successfully protected these nets and preserved social memory, offering a compelling new strategy for treatment. Because this mechanism appears independent of amyloid buildup, it may reshape how Alzheimer’s disease is understood and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Social memory loss in Alzheimer’s is tied to the degradation of perineuronal nets surrounding neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; MMP inhibitors prevented net breakdown in mice and preserved their ability to recognize familiar individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings reveal a therapeutic pathway independent of amyloid pathology, reshaping prevailing Alzheimer’s models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most devastating moments for family members of a patient with Alzheimer’s is when their loved one forgets who they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New University of Virginia School of Medicine research may explain why that happens and could lead to a way to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVA’s Harald Sontheimer, PhD, and graduate student Lata Chaunsali and their colleagues found that the failure to recognize family, friends and caregivers is caused by the breakdown of protective “nets” that surround neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing the loss of these nets in lab mice protected the mice from losing their memories of previous social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offer an exciting target for the development of new treatments to benefit Alzheimer’s patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding a structural change that explains a specific memory loss in Alzheimer’s is very exciting,” said Sontheimer, chair of UVA’s Department of Neuroscience and member of the UVA Brain Institute. “It is a completely new target, and we already have suitable drug candidates in hand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s: A Growing Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s affects 55 million people around the world, and that number is expected to grow by 35% in the next five years alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, UVA has established the Harrison Family Translational Research Center in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases as part of its Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. The institute aims to accelerate the development of new treatments and cures for some of the world’s most challenging diseases, including Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sontheimer’s new work sheds important light on the development of the disease. He and his team previously revealed the importance of what are called “perineuronal nets” in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These net-like structures surround nerve cells called neurons and perform a critical barrier function that lets neurons communicate correctly. These communications allow the neurons to form and store new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on those results, Sontheimer and his collaborators suspected that disruptions of the nets could be a critical turning point in Alzheimer’s. Their latest work bears that out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that lab mice that had faulty nets lost their ability to remember other mice – their “social memory” – even as they could still form new memories of objects in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors what is seen in people with Alzheimer’s, where social memory often fails before object memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sontheimer and his team then used “MMP inhibitors” – a class of drugs already being investigated for their potential to treat cancer and arthritis – to see if they could prevent the loss of the perineuronal nets. It worked. The approach staved off the degradation of the nets and preserved the mice’s social memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Alzheimer’s disease, people have trouble remembering their family and friends due to the loss of a memory known as social memory. We found that the net-like coating known as perineuronal nets protects these social memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our research with mice, when we kept these brain structures safe early in life, the mice suffering from this disease were better at remembering their social interactions,” Chaunsali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research will help us get closer to finding a new, non-traditional way to treat or better yet prevent Alzheimer’s disease, something that is much needed today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes the scientists saw in the mice’s brains align with those seen in human patients with Alzheimer’s, suggesting that the targeting the nets in people could provide similar benefits. Developing a treatment based on the findings will require additional research, but Sontheimer and Chaunsali are hopeful about what the future could hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we have drugs that can delay the loss of perineuronal nets, and thereby delay memory loss in disease, more research needs to be done regarding safety and effectiveness of our approach before this can be considered in humans,” Sontheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most interesting aspect of our research is the fact that the loss of perineuronal nets observed in our studies occurred completely independent of amyloid and plaque pathology, adding to the suspicion that those protein aggregates may not be causal of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article is open access, meaning it is free to read.

We investigate the role of perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized coats of extracellular matrix around hippocampal CA2 neurons in AD-associated social memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70813-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We utilized 5XFAD mouse model of AD and employed immunohistochemistry, microscopy, bulk RNA-sequencing, animal behavior, gene-knockout, and drug-treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70813-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AD mice showed profound disruption of CA2 PNNs with concomitant impairment of social cognition memory. Genetic or enzymatic CA2 PNN disruption in wild-type mice mimicked these impairments. Transcriptomic analysis shows upregulation of PNN-cleaving matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in AD mice causing disequilibrium of PNN synthesis and remodeling. Chronic inhibition of MMPs retains CA2 PNN and delays social memory impairments in 5XFAD mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70813-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AD-associated social memory impairments are caused by loss of CA2 PNNs. Inhibition of PNN proteolysis by MMPs preserves social memory, suggesting PNN as a promising therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:32:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBmeno2SUJjaW1PMU5rNks4ZHpVVFJYNF9EdzFERE1Ud2xTTFU0cEdZNXVKb3Q4d1ZDYUxrNXpLSWUzRHpJN3NTNVluOGZSWHBJQklCejhzVWxTS1dCb01hOUlwUHdBbEpET1kxZ0MtTFBwZw</guid></item><item><title>专家表示，老年人需要6种维生素和矿物质- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/want-to-age-gracefully-add-these-6-vitamins-and-minerals-to-your-diet-now/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Aging gracefully requires taking care of your body as it begins to change.

Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that an unprocessed diet contains about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet contains less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" target="_self"&gt;400 to 420mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of foods. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in sports and exercise medicine, said that magnesium can be found in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a supplement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084641/" target="_self"&gt;body can't absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" target="_self"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins, such as meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, notes that individuals taking medications that block B12 absorption, such as omeprazole or metformin, may also require a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" target="_self"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are recommended to take 1,200mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" target="_self"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often referred to as the "sunshine vitamin" because it is typically absorbed through the skin by simply being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough.

Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" target="_self"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." target="_self"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/what-to-know-multivitamins-memory-brain-health-age/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, as the Cleveland Clinic points out, the body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22isn%27t%20able%20to%20produce%20enough%20omega-3s%20on%20its%20own%22}" target="_self"&gt;is unable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" target="_self"&gt; to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/should-take-omega-3-supplements-benefits-drawbacks/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or the supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." target="_self"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts, but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" target="_self"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/how-weightlifting-benefits-you-during-the-aging-process/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other healthy habits, obtaining the right minerals and vitamins can improve your overall health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in your diet each day. Consult your doctor before taking any supplements to determine how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many factors that can lead to this, one of the more common reasons is because when you get older your body has a slower metabolism and less stomach acid, meaning absorbing nutrients is harder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things you may experience if you're not getting enough of the vitamins listed here include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle cramps or weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry and brittle hair and nails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more symptoms you could experience as a result of vitamin deficiency and any concerns should be brought up with your doctor before taking any supplements or changing your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPcnU0TVVKN09rcHRkMWJpZTJ5ci1jTWtXM0NhRlMxVmRGblVIdHdEb1IyN3ltb2M4NlhLc2VhUDc2TElqdDNENW1yV1o0dmltb0JoYWVJQS00UWF0VUZDQUthUWRkaVJzTXR2bUtFTEd1MUZLZTJPbExMNFplYmpqQ2tTS2NmV1ViQ2JiSnNZdVd4ZFFwYV90aU5hdFZaM3ZsYURuUVhRdm41Yng4a1NTdl9n</guid></item><item><title>正如最近的一项研究所表明的那样，大脑训练真的可以减少大脑衰老十年吗？ - The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/can-brain-training-really-shave-ten-years-off-brain-ageing-as-a-recent-study-suggests-268904</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ten-week online brain training programme helped older adults’ brains act as though they were a decade younger, a recent study has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like exercise for the body, regular &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/brain-training-7463"&gt;mental workouts&lt;/a&gt; can help keep the brain in shape. As we age, brain processes that support memory, attention and decision-making can become less efficient. Keeping the mind active is thought to build a reserve that helps people cope better with these age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that people who stay mentally, physically and socially active have a lower risk of developing dementia. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21282661/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 older adults, those who engaged in regular aerobic exercise had larger brain volumes and better cognitive performance than those who were less active, reversing age-related loss in brain volume over a couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163714000208"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found that brain training can improve older adults’ cognitive performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; adds to what we know by testing whether brain training programmes – BrainHQ, in this instance – can change the brain’s chemistry, offering biological clues about how brain training might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrainHQ is a brain training app that offers short, game-like exercises that train cognitive skills such as attention, memory and brain speed. As users improve, the challenges get harder, pushing the brain to adapt – much like increasing the weights during a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-two healthy adults from Canada, 65 and older, took part. Half of them completed brain training exercises using BrainHQ for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, over ten weeks. The other half, a comparison group, spent the same amount of time playing games designed just for entertainment, such as solitaire.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see whether the programme made a difference to the brain, all participants had specialised scans before and after the ten weeks of training. These scans can detect tiny chemical changes in brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which plays an important role in attention, learning and memory. Those who completed the speed-based exercises showed stronger activity in this area compared to those in the comparison group. The change in brain chemicals seen is described by the researchers as equivalent to shaving ten years off their biological age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ageing and cognitive decline (including Alzheimer’s disease) are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1913629/"&gt;often linked to reduced activity&lt;/a&gt; in this part of the brain. Strengthening it may therefore help delay or reduce cognitive decline and lower the risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the results look promising, we should be careful about how we interpret them. The study measured many different outcomes. Although the brain training group showed increased activity compared with their own baseline, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the study looked at so many outcomes and involved only a small number of people, some of these changes may simply be due to chance rather than real effects of the training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;With ageing, there is often a decline in part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/retired-couple-holding-hands-looking-each-1272275779"&gt;LightField Studios/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a small study involving healthy, mostly white older adults, and it looked at one specific brain training app. The findings may not apply to people with memory problems or to other types of brain-training programmes, or to longer-term outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intervention is relatively short. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534025/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; found that most interventions aiming to improve cognitive performance that are successful typically last at least four to six months. Longer-term participation is almost certainly key to achieving lasting improvement in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies like this rely on brain scans as early indicators of benefit, but it remains to be seen whether these biological changes translate into lasting improvements in functioning. Researchers are testing whether similar brain-training programmes can help people who show early signs of dementia. These studies will reveal whether boosting brain activity this way can slow cognitive decline in those already showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interventions – such as the one tested that required two and a half hours of training per week – may not suit everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, people with existing cognitive concerns who want to improve their cognitive wellbeing may struggle to access digital programmes. They may need more &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(25)00096-0/fulltext?rss=yes"&gt;community-based, supportive and lower-intensity interventions&lt;/a&gt;. To be an effective dementia programme, recruitment needs to be inclusive, especially reaching people from underserved groups who are at the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive ageing is shaped by many factors – including physical activity, social connection, healthy diet and mental wellbeing – so brain training is likely to be just one part of a broader approach to supporting brain health and dementia prevention. Keeping the mind active may not stop ageing, but it could help the brain stay younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Researchers at the University of Nottingham say they’ve come up with a new type of gel that can repair and rebuild tooth enamel — a potentially game-changing treatment, since dentistry today is largely limited to preventative care and halting the progress of decay, rather than reversing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64982-y" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the protein-based gel uses the human body’s natural growth processes from early in life to form a durable coating and fill in small cavities in teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;After being coated on a target tooth’s surface, it extracts calcium and phosphate ions from saliva to encourage new growth of minerals. These minerals then merge with the existing tooth, effectively allowing it to regrow lost enamel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While the gel has yet to be tested in human mouths, it has shown promise on extracted human teeth in a lab. That’s huge, since enamel can’t naturally regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The gel could also be used to cover dentine, the bony material beneath the enamel that can be exposed due to enamel degradation, leading to infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel,” explained lead author and University of Nottingham postdoctoral fellow Abshar Hasan in a &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/goodbye-cavities-scientists-just-found-a-way-to-regrow-tooth-enamel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Lab experiments showed that a thin, protective layer formed within just weeks of applying the gel to extracted human molar teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating ‘real-life situations’ such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel,” Hasan added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The growth actually happens within a week,” University of Nottingham biomedical engineering professor Alvaro Mata &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2502731-cavities-could-be-prevented-by-a-gel-that-restores-tooth-enamel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Mata and his colleagues are looking to commercialize the product as part of a new startup called Mintech-Bio. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, plenty of work will still be required until we can determine whether it’s safe and effective for humans. Clinical trials are scheduled for early next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our findings demonstrate a capacity to grow enamel-like structures under conditions that closely imitate various mechanical and chemical challenges found in the mouth,” the researchers wrote in their paper. “However, these tests do not fully recreate the complexity of the in vivo oral environment and, consequently, to fully confirm the capacity to regenerate natural enamel would require in vivo validation, which we envision to pursue in future work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Nonetheless, the team hopes that their “technology could potentially provide a one-pot solution for the regeneration of dental enamel independently of the level of tooth erosion.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers have found that toothpaste made from keratin, a protein naturally present in hair, skin, and wool, could both protect and repair damaged teeth while offering a sustainable alternative to traditional dental treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from King's College London discovered that keratin can rebuild tooth enamel and halt the early stages of decay. When keratin interacts with the minerals found in saliva, it forms a coating that closely replicates the composition and protective function of natural enamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sherif Elsharkawy, senior author and consultant in prosthodontics at King's College London, explained: "Unlike bones and hair, enamel does not regenerate, once it is lost, it's gone forever."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting Teeth from Erosion and Cavities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday habits, from drinking acidic beverages to poor brushing routines, wear away enamel over time. This erosion can lead to sensitivity, discomfort, and eventually tooth loss. While fluoride toothpaste helps slow this process, the keratin-based formulation in the new study went further, completely preventing it in laboratory tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keratin creates a dense, mineralized barrier over the tooth's surface, blocking the nerve channels responsible for sensitivity. This not only protects against further damage but also provides immediate relief from discomfort, addressing both cause and symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision the treatment being available in two forms: a daily-use toothpaste or a professional gel applied by dentists, similar to nail varnish. According to the team, keratin-based enamel repair products could be accessible to the public within two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Keratin Helps Teeth Heal Themselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;, scientists extracted keratin from wool and applied it to tooth surfaces. When exposed to the natural minerals present in saliva, the protein organized itself into a crystal-like structure that mimicked real enamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this microscopic framework continued to attract calcium and phosphate ions, gradually forming a durable, enamel-like layer. The finding marks an important milestone in regenerative dentistry and brings researchers closer to treatments that can rebuild the tooth's protective shell rather than just patching damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable, Natural, and Clinically Effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara Gamea, PhD researcher at King's College London and the study's first author, said: "Keratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments. Not only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin, it also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable. Keratin also looks much more natural than these treatments, as it can more closely match the color of the original tooth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research addresses growing concerns about the environmental impact of dental materials and the long-term use of fluoride. By using recycled biological materials, this approach could make dental care more eco-friendly while reducing dependence on synthetic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Era of Biotech Dentistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This technology bridges the gap between biology and dentistry, providing an eco-friendly biomaterial that mirrors natural processes," said Gamea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elsharkawy added: "We are entering an exciting era where biotechnology allows us to not just treat symptoms but restore biological function using the body's own materials. With further development and the right industry partnerships, we may soon be growing stronger, healthier smiles from something as simple as a haircut."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work received support from the Wellcome Trust Seed Award, King's College London, the Academy of Medical Sciences 'Starter Grants for Clinical Lecturers', and the National Institute of Health Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apples are a delicious, nutrient-dense fruit that is particularly high in fiber. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts say eating an apple in the morning can help you get the most out of its fiber. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may help keep your digestive system regular, improve blood sugar and help you feel full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you can’t get enough of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16369/whats-fresh-the-best-and-worst-apples-for-eating-cooking-baking/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;juicy, sweet flavor of apples&lt;/a&gt;, you aren’t alone.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering the wealth of things fiber does for our bodies, there are lots of good reasons to munch on an apple. But does the timing matter? To find out, we asked two registered dietitians to share their thoughts. Read on to find out when they recommend eating your apple to get the maximum benefits from this fiber-rich fruit.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While there’s no ‘best’ time to enjoy an apple, research suggests that the morning may be an ideal time to maximize the fiber benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mycrohnsandcolitisteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you add some chopped apples to your oats at breakfast or snack on an apple midmorning to tide you over until lunch, it’s an easy way to get a jump start on your daily fiber goals.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Can Help Keep Your Digestive System Regular &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like our day-to-day lives are governed by the clock, your body also runs on an internal clock, known as your circadian rhythm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why many people feel the urge to poop at around the same time every day. For many of us, that’s in the morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-with-more-fiber-than-an-apple-11797285" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich apple&lt;/a&gt; early in the day can help you take advantage of that increased colonic activity and nudge your body to go No. 2. In fact, apples have not one, but two different types of fiber that keep things moving smoothly. The first is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which bulks up your stool and gives you a push. The other is soluble fiber, which forms a slick gel to ease things along. If that weren’t enough, apple’s pectin also feeds your good gut bacteria to keep your gut in tip-top shape. That might help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prevent constipation&lt;/a&gt; over the long haul.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Blood Sugar Balance &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to assume that naturally sweet apples will spike your blood sugar. However, eating an apple in the a.m. may set you up for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;steadier blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; later in the day. Once again, the hero here is pectin. Its thick, sludge-like gel slows down digestion, so it takes longer for food to travel through your intestines. That doesn’t just keep you full longer. It may prevent undesirable blood sugar spikes that can cause cravings, explains &lt;a href="https://themetabolicdietitian.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny Finke, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to eating apples (or any other healthy food), there’s also something to be said for consistency. Research has linked regularly eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-low-sugar-fruits-11751935" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-glycemic index fruits&lt;/a&gt;, like apples, grapes and blueberries, to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292264/5-foods-people-should-eat-every-day-to-help-prevent-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. So, keep up that daily apple habit!

They offer loads of nutrients in a low-calorie package. And that package includes fiber, which has a solid track record for helping with weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because fiber helps you feel full, it may help you eat less overall, says Finke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For anyone who is on a weight-loss journey, she suggests eating a whole apple 10 to 15 minutes before a meal to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15325/foods-that-do-the-weight-loss-work-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;maximize those satiety benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Grab an apple for a late-morning snack, and it might help you eat less at lunch!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to a daily apple, here are a few other simple tips to help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;squeeze more fiber into your day&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Add Beans: &lt;/strong&gt;With as much as 8 grams of fiber per half-cup, adding beans to your meals is a solid strategy for racking up more fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You don’t need to change up your whole menu either. Zenker suggests simply adding canned beans to your usual meals by stirring some lentils into spaghetti sauce or blending white beans into a creamy soup along with the rest of the ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle on Some Flaxseed:&lt;/strong&gt; Flaxseeds may be small, but they pack an impressive number of nutrients into a tiny package, especially fiber. Sprinkling a couple of tablespoons of these seeds onto baked goods, oats or yogurt can deliver 4 grams of additional fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach for Whole Grains:&lt;/strong&gt; Swapping in whole-grain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way to tack more fiber onto a meal. For example, using whole-grain bread for a sandwich can give you 4 to 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Leafy Greens: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep some fresh or frozen greens on hand to boost the fiber in your meals and add color, too. Take kale, for example. One cooked cup gives you 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If kale isn’t your thing, try spinach, arugula or Swiss chard. These greens make an easy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-high-fiber-recipes-you-ll-want-to-make-from-breakfast-to-dinner-8673480" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich addition&lt;/a&gt; to eggs, sandwiches, soups or even your morning smoothie. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There may be a kernel of truth to the old adage about eating an apple a day. Apples are a delicious, nutrient-dense and conveniently portable fruit that is particularly high in fiber. Eating an apple at any time of day is a win for your health. But if you’re looking to maximize its fiber benefits, experts recommend eating your apple in the morning. It will give you a head start on your day’s fiber. Plus, it may help keep your digestive system regular, improve blood sugar and keep you feeling nice and full all morning long.&lt;br&gt;
