&lt;p&gt;When dermatologist Dr. Nicholas Perricone unveiled a diet he promised would act as a “three-day nutritional facelift” in his bestselling book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWrinkle-Cure-Unlock-Cosmeceuticals-Youthful%2Fdp%2F0446677760%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fdib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yqxbn7XTB9lGgNfaJ2T-p6nkFucFyn0cIb6FwoxIuq8Dh8qI9pE82CSDLefu8kNGwv33D76wqSZzMD6SgvTHEikW1Sx9Uh7SsZDGXM28Ia2QBL7R1Ed1ixxeQyrRiAdAOjMq8ucT9g5zaJIKfuqtbnmoQfejEtgEoSKa6O6Sblm1iopz2ztEq4Q2dxKJDfHdiPErGEE_grj7zLtuUrfHd_bKA8uEy-C_7uttBccL8KQ.w0Tthh5WuJtXz5gfTNWX29A_2QNCuL84lx9vlwnEIY4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26hvadid%3D694562032792%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvexpln%3D67%26hvlocphy%3D9197632%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvocijid%3D307442656608753823--%26hvqmt%3De%26hvrand%3D307442656608753823%26hvtargid%3Dkwd-301078282219%26hydadcr%3D15521_13558544%26keywords%3Dthe%20wrinkle%20cure%20book%26mcid%3Da3a45f1a44723c6d93d8c1aba3932b30%26qid%3D1740672374%26sr%3D8-1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F27%2Fhealth%2Fceleb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Wrinkle Cure&lt;/a&gt;,” he had his fair share of skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Famed journalist Diane Sawyer told him she believed his “claims were overstated and that she planned to challenge [him],” Perricone recalls in his new book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeauty-Molecule-Introducing-Neuroceuticals-Breakthrough%2Fdp%2F1250286794%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F27%2Fhealth%2Fceleb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Beauty Molecule&lt;/a&gt;,” due out April 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when Sawyer and Oprah Winfrey tested the nutritional facelift, they “could not believe their eyes when they witnessed the effects of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/this-diet-lowers-risk-cancer-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; after just three days.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I designed this 3-day diet to reduce puffiness, enhance contours and firm the jawline,” he told The Post. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Subbotina Anna – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon, many others were blown away by how much &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/health/three-gym-rats-in-their-70s-and-80s-reveal-how-they-stay-fit-its-like-a-game-of-whack-a-mole/"&gt;younger they looked&lt;/a&gt; — and how energetic they felt — after following the meal plan for only 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed this 3-day diet to reduce puffiness, enhance contours and firm the jawline — and including salmon twice daily will leave your skin firmer and more radiant,” Perricone told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/health/neurologist-reveals-3-ingredient-dinner-to-prevent-alzheimers/"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; is a crucial component of this diet. “You must eat salmon at least twice a day for the ideal effect,” he wrote, vowing it will “change your skin, making it firmer and more lustrous.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because salmon provides good-quality, easily digestible protein that converts into amino acids “necessary to repair the body on a cellular level.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it might sound counterintuitive, Perricone claims a “carbohydrate-heavy and protein-light diet leads to the loss of contours in the face — the sought-after chiseled look of a well-defined jawline, cheekbones and eyes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salmon is also a great source of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/im-a-holistic-doctor-3-foods-that-mimic-ozempic/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; EPA and DHA — which can help your brain, heart, metabolism, mood and skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Salmon is a great source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;volff – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Aside from salmon, the “three-day nutritional facelift” focuses on salads, berries and dark, leafy greens like spinach, arugula and kale. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/i-ate-only-raw-fruits-and-veggies-for-3-months-and-lost-77-lbs/"&gt;Berries&lt;/a&gt; are full of anti-inflammatory antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress and protect against cell damage. They’re also a good source of vitamin C, which aids in collagen production. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark, leafy greens contain chlorophyll, which can help reduce redness and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/greek-island-with-almost-no-dementia-the-two-drinks-they-love/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fight acne and eczema.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’re also rich in vitamin E, which can lessen the effect of sun damage, beta-carotene, which reduces the appearance of fine lines and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/anti-aging-breakthrough-stop-wrinkles-gray-hair-with-these-hormones/"&gt;wrinkles&lt;/a&gt; — and vitamin K, which helps keep the skin nice and plump. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, Perricone’s diet demands at least six glasses of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/health/chemical-in-us-drinking-water-linked-to-higher-risk-of-2-cancers/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; a day. He advises drinking two eight-ounce cans of hydrogen water — water that’s been enhanced with molecular hydrogen gas (H2) — every morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of his other tips include always eating protein first “as it helps slow down carbohydrate absorption, which results in control of insulin and glucose levels.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But most importantly? “Follow this diet to the letter,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dark, leafy greens contain chlorophyll, which can help reduce redness and inflammation, as well as fight acne and eczema. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;noirchocolate – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;       &lt;strong&gt;THE 3-DAY NUTRITIONAL DIET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                          &lt;strong&gt;BREAKFAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-egg omelet or 4 to 6 ounces grilled, baked or poached salmon&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Perricone does not recommend smoked salmon on the 3-day diet because of the high salt content. Otherwise, smoked salmon is fine.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-inch slice of cantaloupe or ¹∕&lt;sub&gt;³ &lt;/sub&gt;cup fresh berries&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 to 8 ounces spring water (feel free to squeeze fresh lemon into the water if desired)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No juice, coffee or toast&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you normally have coffee to start your day, drink black or green tea to prevent caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                                  &lt;strong&gt;LUNCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 ounces grilled, baked or poached poultry&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2 cups green salad, made with romaine lettuce and other dark, leafy greens such as spinach, arugula and kale. Top with 3 tablespoons cooked chickpeas. (Canned chickpeas are fine as long as you drain them.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extra-virgin olive oil dressing, with fresh-squeezed lemon to taste&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1 apple or 1 pear or 2-inch slice cantaloupe or ¹∕&lt;sub&gt;³ &lt;/sub&gt;cup berries and 6 to 8 ounces spring water&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                                  &lt;strong&gt;DINNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 ounces freshly cooked — grilled, broiled or poached — salmon on 1 cup of warmed lentils&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Green salad (as described above)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;½ cup steamed vegetables, especially asparagus, broccoli and spinach (avoid root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, beets and parsnips)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-inch slice cantaloupe&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 to 8 ounces spring water&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you follow this diet for three days to the letter, be ready for a great improvement in how you look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I remember someone in the community talking about their child who had been ‘vaccine injured’,” Johnson recalls. “It sparked a fear in me.” The science of vaccinations and immunization schedules also seemed impenetrable. “I was very conflicted, and felt like: ‘I don’t know any of this stuff, I didn’t go to school for this,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She wondered whether vaccinating her daughter had been a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson joined “crunchy” Facebook groups full of moms concerned about potentially harmful substances affecting their children, and started taking advice from a trusted anti-vax family member who seemed particularly credible because she was a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;With her next three children, Johnson chose not to vaccinate. This left them vulnerable to infections with high infant-mortality rates, like invasive pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae and whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I felt I had done the quote-unquote research,” says Johnson. She read sources she thought were rational, like Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk’s book Dissolving Illusions, which perpetuates the &lt;a href="https://vaccinarsinsardegna.org/en/science-knowledge/countering-disinformation/improved-hygiene-conditions-are-no-substitute-for-vaccinations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; that hygiene, not vaccines, is primarily responsible for the decline of infectious diseases. She and her anti-vax community were convinced the medical system was corrupt, profiting from the distribution of unsafe, unnecessary vaccines. To them, not vaccinating their children was the hard but righteous thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson soon began sharing what she had learned with others. “I had a decent following online. People were coming to me and listening to what I was sharing on the internet,” says Johnson, who remembers feeling a kind of “dopamine rush” when talking to other moms about vaccine “risks”. “I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Around 2020, Johnson’s perspective shifted abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She started feeling like her MLM job was rigged: “I was having a lot of success, and then I wasn’t. I started watching some anti-MLM content and realizing that everything I knew was just part of a lie,” says Johnson. “Then I watched my family member who I trusted fall deep into the QAnon rabbit hole. I just felt that was too ridiculous ... Like, I can’t really trust her judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9b3fe76b-6be5-4299-b84c-acb6352db0d9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How I escaped the wild west of #cleaneating Instagram and TikTok","elementId":"9b3fe76b-6be5-4299-b84c-acb6352db0d9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/16/food-nutrition-misinformation-social-media"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson learned how misinformation spreads on social media, and re-evaluated the wellness content she had been consuming.

She was “exiled” from her mom groups but didn’t really mind. She asked her pediatrician to help catch her children up on vaccines as quickly as possible. “[Pediatricians] realize that people have gotten into this anti-vaccine rhetoric,” Johnson says. “They work with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Today, Johnson has relinquished the anti-vax myths that once shaped her life and identity. For experts and activists, such stories offer a glimmer of hope. As vaccine skepticism grows in the US and whole communities become more vulnerable to preventable diseases, is it possible to break through the noise and get people the healthcare they need?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-anti-vax-sentiment-is-growing-in-the-us" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why anti-vax sentiment is growing in the US&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The anti-vax movement first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1181850/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;emerged&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-19th century in response to mandatory smallpox-vaccination laws. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, anti-vax activism was increasingly tied to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9981160/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rightwing politics&lt;/a&gt;, framed around fears of government overreach and threats to personal freedom. In recent years, fueled by distrust of medical institutions, Covid-19-related anxieties and social media misinformation, the shift has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While vaccines may carry temporary side effects like soreness and fever, as well as the rare possibility of certain more serious risks like allergic reactions, no credible scientists who study infectious disease and epidemiology think that vaccines are remotely nearly as dangerous as the diseases they prevent, says Dr Joe Pierre, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco, and author of &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/false-9780197765272" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;False&lt;/a&gt;.

Afterwards, her daughter started crying inconsolably and experienced low appetite. Greene called Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Agency of Canada’s non-emergency hotline for advice, but the nurse dismissed her concerns. She felt “kind of embarrassed”, Greene recalls, like just a panicky new mom making a big deal out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still worried, Greene went online. In a motherhood forum, she read about a frightening but &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6265562/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;false&lt;/a&gt; theory that babies lack a blood-brain barrier, making them vulnerable to brain injury from vaccines. “I found people saying: ‘They’re never going to admit it’s a vaccine side effect, but [your baby’s] brain is probably inflamed, she’s probably in pain,’” says Greene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Greene remembers a rising sense of panic and a distinct fear: “‘Something’s wrong with my kid.’” Subsequently, she decided not to vaccinate her next two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"d2d2e910-ce74-45ae-a78e-faa4fe6998d7","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d2d2e910-ce74-45ae-a78e-faa4fe6998d7" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Her awakening came at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when she observed her anti-vax community “shunning the things they said prevented disease, like hygiene and masking”. To her, that seemed like “contrarianism, not critical thinking”. Moreover, Greene never found a single study supporting the notion that infants lack a blood-brain barrier, and was shocked to see some of the people in her anti-vax community online also claiming that the Earth is flat, which she thought was ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-33" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conspiratorial excesses are unlikely to alienate every believer. “On the contrary, cognitive dissonance, the tension that arises when our beliefs butt up against reality, is typically resolved by digging our heels in even deeper,” says Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-real-life-stories-in-changing-beliefs" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;The importance of real-life stories in changing beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still, some &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-can-be-overcome-through-relatable-stories-and-accessible-information-169221" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; believe personal stories, like Johnson’s and Greene’s, are more persuasive than facts alone. To convince vaccine deniers, “scientific facts should be contextualized and made relatable to be understood as elements of a human experience”, write the authors of one 2021 report. &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/why-vaccinate/personal-stories/?_gl=1*5x0fck*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU5NzA5MTUyNi4xNzM4ODYzNjkw*_ga_CEHFEY8NBB*MTczODg2MzY4OS4xLjAuMTczODg2MzY4OS4wLjAuMA.." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Vaccine advocacy groups&lt;/a&gt; often feature personal stories as part of their education materials to convey the risks of preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Stories reveal the ways anti-vax ideology can cause harm, whether by increasing the risk of illness or distorting how children understand the world. Violet Adams, 32 (her name has been changed for her privacy), says that when she was growing up in British Columbia, her parents’ fear of vaccines instilled terror. “It’s very traumatizing as a child to hear things like: ‘The world is run by this evil, shadowy cabal,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At university, she saw firsthand that the science professors were “not brainwashed, not sheep” - and her beliefs began to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To the general public, many vaccine-preventable diseases – say, polio or smallpox – can seem like relics of the distant past; people are not always familiar with their effects. Greene argues that public messaging should depict the consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases, saying: “[People] need to know what diphtheria looks like, how it closes off your airway until you suffocate and die.” Washington state’s former secretary of health Dr Umair Shah has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/21/covid-vaccines-science-2024-election-00116520" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it may take the death of an influential figure to a vaccine-preventable disease to bring back wider acceptance of immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cc631ad0-d06b-4128-ba8e-4bb530597b2f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr Harry Seanor of Willard Parker hospital with polio survivor Mark Fresco, age eight, wearing a newer ‘Monaghan’ 1lb iron lung, and Ann Bohrer in an older-model lung, in New York on 22 June 1949.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Bettmann Archive&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Firsthand experience with vaccine-preventable diseases can be a wake-up call. In 2015, formerly anti-vax mother Kristen O’Meara watched all three of her children suffer through severe cases of rotavirus. “It was awful, and it didn’t have to happen, because I could have had them vaccinated. I felt guilty. I felt really guilty,” she later said in an &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/anti-vaxxer-mom-mind-kids-fall-ill/story?id=42351543" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. The experience led her to reconsider her stance and vaccinate her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, institutions “have to work on how to present the truth in ways that are psychologically appealing”, says Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Conspiracy beliefs can be fueled by psychological needs like uniqueness, a sense of control and social affiliation, says Pierre. Crusading for the truth is a powerful feeling; think of Johnson’s “dopamine rush”. Greene has found meaning in helping others via vaccine advocacy – a different way to satisfy those needs. She is now a nurse and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://backtothevax.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Back to the Vax&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that connects previously vaccine-hesitant parents, and a representative for the organization &lt;a href="https://www.voicesforvaccines.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Voices for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-information-and-support-can-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How information and support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Devon Greyson, a health information scientist, has studied mothers who changed their minds about vaccines in an effort to “reverse engineer” the process, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667321522000221#sec4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Greyson interviewed 23 mothers in Vancouver, Canada, whose vaccine attitudes evolved over time, whether more in favor of vaccines or further against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Mothers who became more confident in vaccines described their shift as a cognitive journey “toward facts and away from fear”, guided by trustworthy health authorities and real-world experience, says Greyson. They benefited from non-judgmental support, opportunities to ask healthcare providers questions and the reassurance of seeing with their own eyes that vaccines didn’t harm their children. Greyson suggests this framework could be useful in communicating with vaccine-hesitant individuals: instead of simply telling them to “trust science”, encourage them to think scientifically – to ask questions of trusted experts, identify reliable sources and remain intellectually flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By contrast, mothers who became more skeptical described their experience as a descent into fear and anxiety, often triggered by dismissive healthcare encounters.

Still, even small efforts to build trust, such as referring patients to reliable information and support, are “so important” in helping families make informed choices, says Martin, whose research focuses on Black Americans’ experiences in the healthcare system, including vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908879/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00027162221087936" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prebunking&lt;/a&gt;”, or proactively warning people about vaccine conspiracies, is a promising approach. Resources like the &lt;a href="https://jitsuvax.info/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Jitsuvax project&lt;/a&gt;, co-created by psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral scientists and clinicians from seven universities to combat misinformation, can help inoculate people against &lt;a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/explainers/anti-vaccine-conspiracies/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;particular conspiracies&lt;/a&gt; before they stumble upon them online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There’s no guaranteed way to snap someone out of anti-vax beliefs. But what helps is early, empathetic support from community and healthcare providers, and making space for people to change their minds as they embrace facts and critical thinking. Johnson, Adams and Greene changed their views not because they were debated into submission, but because they were open, flexible and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson is raising her kids with a solid foundation in scientific thinking. “I’m trying so hard to teach my kids critical-thinking skills,” Johnson says. “I feel like I’m a fairly smart person, and if I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=""

Green&lt;/a&gt;, MD, &lt;em&gt;Chief of the&lt;/em&gt; Division of Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology, UCSF, and lead author on the study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work shows what appear to be multiple negative effects &lt;em&gt;for some people &lt;/em&gt;when their B12 levels are in the lower range of what has long been considered adequate or normal (and would not qualify as deficient). This includes slowed transmission of signals in the brain, slowed processing speed on cognitive tests and MRI evidence of white matter injury. Most importantly, these effects are strongest when looking at the ‘active’ fraction of B12 (which is not routinely checked) rather than just total blood B12 levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale, the researchers found that higher levels of B12 also had effects that may impact cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those people with higher B12 levels had increased levels of T-Tau protein, which is associated with neurodegeneration and dementia. This association was strongest when there were low levels of active B12 and high levels of holo-HC, or ‘inactive B12’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segil suggested that further research was needed to verify why the study might have found this. Green concurred:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We also saw that high levels of ‘inactive’ B12 in the blood may be associated with a blood marker of axon injury. It should be noted that we did not have a means of directly measuring inactive B12 levels in the paper but had to calculate the level from other measurements. The full meaning of this result needs further study but it suggests that measuring total blood B12 may mislead doctors and patients in some situations to think that active B12 levels are adequate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that recommendations for B12 should be very likely be reconsidered — and not just based on B12 blood levels but considering measures of active vs inactive B12 and looking at measures of neurological and cognitive function. Measuring what is adequate by just measuring what is average (and the distribution) in the population does not prove that the levels are adequate for any nutrients,” Green told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that the observed detrimental effect of low B12 on cognitive processes may be caused by changes in the integrity of the myelin surrounding nerve cells. However, they emphasise that their study did not look into how these changes might occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they suggest that elderly people may be particularly vulnerable to declining levels of B12, so the guidelines for healthy B12 levels may need to be revised for this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is lots of additional research that needs to be done. The reasons why inadequate B12 causes neurological dysfunction— specifically which cell types in the brain and which parts of the nervous system most require B12 — is completely unclear. This needs careful scientific and laboratory work which is currently going on in our laboratory and affiliated labs.”&lt;br&gt;— Ari J. Green, MD, lead author of the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure adequate B12, people should include foods that are rich in the vitamin in their diet. Segil advised that salmon and beef are two of the best sources of B12. As plant foods do not contain B12, vegetarians and vegans might benefit from supplements to ensure healthy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;NIH states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; that even at large doses, vitamin B12 is generally considered to be safe because the body does not store excess amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Both kids and adults can get B12 deficiencies from absorption issues even if they eat a diet high in B12 products,” adding, “for the general public, I would recommend using a multivitamin with B12 in it rather than a B12 supplement, which can come in a liquid form, gel cap or regular tab,” Segil said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 14:43:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNQVNrNm9UZGN4SFJUYnctUVBRT2VKYjFTMmVlUGpIdGhyS0RfUC1lSXRtbk5OcUtKNk9vdm9ld2F0MURMTmp1Y3FRNHBsQVQzNFBhTWt3R2dDbWVMTWlhbHlXNV9kckNHX2NpMkVYeXZWeG9qZi04Y3dfaGh6S29mMGR5dFZqUTJSNXJrUDlfVXZDX29PeU5wYlRoYnJ2MnNLcE1jR3FQRmh6MlpDUVFKRTNVQjBTLTJ3Q2o5cGJwZEU1dlNjQVl5aTB3</guid></item><item><title>LAX on red alert as foreign traveler brings in deadly disease and infects unknown number - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNOFZ1TUloaDh5RFIxZmZUUUxnSl9BekVNWUdidkVVUmJwNkIyeVRMWGpaaS1fYi1uOTNkbHpCZ2JHUFVVek91ZWRMRDZNYS1VdVE5cTEzZmhyTlljR3hLZFdHQVJqWkVQUk5wc0tESFRtb3VOSGhQNnJXbExLRElSQ05GbDFFc1p2TGQ0VDUxeXhTSFVvTnBXN2E4Y1pUcmJs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-14f4d1e0-f512-11ef-afa6-c762aac65cd9"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; International airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A passenger arriving on a Korean Air flight from Seoul tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness, which is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14422449/Pediatrician-working-heart-Texas-measles-outbreak-warns-just-beginning-cases-surging-90.html"&gt;currently ripping its way through Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Travelers who were in LAX's Terminal B on February 19 during the hours of 1pm to 4pm have been warned that they could be at high risk of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The airport is working with the CDC to notify passengers on the flight who might have been close enough to the infected traveler to contract the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Passengers who fear they may have crossed paths with the patient have been advised to confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn the US is currently vulnerable to measles outbreaks because of falling vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America suffered its first fatality from the disease in a decade this week after the death of an unvaccinated child in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14429317/large-measles-outbreak-vaccinated-rfk.html"&gt;Measles is transmitted by direct contact &lt;/a&gt;with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Los Angeles International airport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In extreme cases, measles can cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-4796db20-f512-11ef-afa6-c762aac65cd9" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and may lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health says LAX passengers who have not been vaccinated 'are at risk of contracting measles if they have been exposed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts say they should monitor for symptoms, with these generally developing 7 to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, 18 people have been hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sixty-two cases are in children between the ages of five and 17 and 39 are in toddlers four years and younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only five of those infected have been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14422449/Pediatrician-working-heart-Texas-measles-outbreak-warns-just-beginning-cases-surging-90.html"&gt;vaccinated with the measles (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. The majority are unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death marks the first in the US since 2015, according to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-f4e80cd0-f464-11ef-828b-3357f2de91df" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine (MMR) is 97 percent effective at preventing the virus and is required for children to attend school, but some states, including Texas, allow exemptions based on religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across the country, the percentage of&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14384857/Girl-12-denied-heart-transplant-shes-not-vaccinated-against-COVID-flu.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14411083/Outbreak-highly-contagious-childhood-disease-expands.html"&gt;children seeking exemptions has risen &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;over the past decade, from 0.76 percent in 2014 to 3.3 percent during the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, in 2024 vaccination coverage among kindergartners declined for all shots - down to 93 percent for MMR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the Texas Department of Human and Health Services reports 91 percent of kids had received the MMR shot, which is below the ideal vaccination rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-four percent coverage is considered the standard for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The CDC posted a bird flu update to the health agency’s website on Wednesday, the first since President Donald Trump took office. The report provides a snapshot of recent human cases of H5N1, including two people who were hospitalized after being infected by different means, bringing the national total to 70 cases and one death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new update, dated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-02262025.html"&gt;Feb. 26&lt;/a&gt;, includes recently confirmed cases in Nevada, Ohio, and Wyoming. The Nevada case is the most mild of the recently confirmed cases and involved a dairy worker whose symptoms included conjunctivitis (eye redness and irritation). That worker was infected by the dairy cows they worked with and experienced only mild symptoms before recovering, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two more serious cases involve being infected by birds, though under very different conditions. The case in Ohio involves a commercial poultry farm worker who was engaging in the systematic slaughter of birds on a farm with infected poultry. The poultry farm worker experienced respiratory symptoms and what the health agency calls “severe illness” and was hospitalized. That worker is now at home and recovering, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case in Wyoming also involves someone infected by birds, but the poultry in this instance was the backyard variety. That person was infected by dead poultry on their property known to have died of bird flu. The Wyoming patient initially tested negative for influenza viruses when upper respiratory specimens were tested but another test was done after that person was hospitalized and a lower respiratory specimen collected several days after the first test were positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case in Wyoming is someone who had “underlying health conditions that can make people more vulnerable to severe influenza illness,” according to the CDC, though it’s not entirely clear what that means. That kind of language was often used during the covid-19 pandemic to rationalize the over 1.2 million deaths experienced in the U.S. since 2020 as somehow acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The USDA reports over &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;19 million birds&lt;/a&gt; are on the premises of farms and other properties that have been confirmed to have bird flu in the past 30 days, including 87 commercial flocks and 51 backyard flocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last update on the CDC’s website before Feb. 26 was dated Jan. 17, a few days before President Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. Trump has been dismantling the U.S. federal government along with his billionaire buddy Elon Musk under the auspices of DOGE, and CDC has been the victim of massive cuts, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5307117/cdc-firings-infectious-disease-response"&gt;mass firings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But the health agency currently notes that human-to-human spread still hasn’t been identified in any of the 70 cases confirmed and the risk to the general public is still considered low. Hopefully, it stays that way, as scientists worry that a mutation that would cause spread between humans would kick off a new pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

This entails, inter alia, communicating effectively the uncertainties regarding the natural history of mpox, updated information about mpox including about the efficacy of mpox vaccines, the uncertainties regarding duration of protection following vaccination, and any relevant information about clinical trials to which the local population may have access, as appropriate.

However, Dr. Lewis noted there have been two confirmed measles exposures in the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"None of those exposures ended in disease, and that’s likely due to prior immunity," he said. "If a person is fully vaccinated against measles, that’s two doses of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/unvaccinated-child-dies-of-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/unvaccinated-child-dies-of-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Texas child who was not vaccinated has died of measles, a 1st for the US in a decade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents in the area are expressing their concerns about the disease. David Schoen, a parent, said, "It’s low risk, high reward, keeping your kids' eyesight and health. It’s not worth it to go your own way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that an estimated 91.3% of children in Washington state were vaccinated for the 2023-2024 school year. However, some parents, like Christopher J. Zarati, are less worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If something was to happen, I mean, there’s nothing I can really do about it," Zarati said. "Vaccines are not 100%. I mean, that’s with every vaccine, so unfortunately, if it happens, it happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to monitor for any measles outbreaks and emphasize that vaccination remains the best protection. "It’s never too late to get it," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO SEE: &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;2 cases of measles exposure confirmed in Snohomish County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOH also says the MMR vaccine is our best defense against measles. MMR vaccination coverage rates for children dropped during the pandemic and have not recovered. In 2023, only about 75% of children aged 19-35 months in Washington were up to date on their MMR vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some data from Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County say an estimated 87% of 2-year-olds in King County have received one dose of the MMR vaccine. Young children are at risk of severe disease from measles, and receiving one dose of MMR can provide crucial protection from complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add that 72% of 4-6-year-olds in King County have received two or more doses of MMR. Children are eligible for a second dose of MMR at 4 years old, and parents should be encouraged to get the second dose as soon as possible instead of waiting until they are enrolled in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 09:36:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxQaEd0VVJTMjFoT1pnQ3pKTmNweFI4b2NqbzhwSG56YzQtRzFOaEFQOHZWc1ZxWHVpSEFlbThwY0VBSzZtQi1tRUZnVElCTmt5aDFZenVHRDVGV0N6N1ZzTmxjaHdBYTBudlU2VEQ4OHR2MEIwNUxWandwZ1dRTHB1dm82TXQ0VFhFZDdPY0FBbkRpb2NscVpBcEdTa2gwNlI5YXVGSEdDNEhYd0dwdHMwa3l0UWsyOUV1NUtXSHRqS1E3Z2RzampoMGxPSW9scjBnalJ1UHFBcDhKZGZ4dTRheHVkdlVPdjBPamN2WGRBV0huYU0xQzFZT1h2RDd4OHZC</guid></item><item><title>Study Reveals How Much Exercise Older Adults Need Each Week To Live Longer - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNR3o2cV9SVVl5Wm9uM1BzUF8xTm1Rbkc4dnhLcVFaQUQ5SGlPREkta2ZBRFpPUGRCZkhmbnZDSXMyeWhwS01WUmNGMFFuNV8wMVdlVllsTHBIVF9jejFqSXZTVjJVNWp0OTJmLWhpQkpmUXpJMkk3NjAycVc5WnI2SDNTeVgxVWdfRWhnZWpJVTVVX285WjN3VFhn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE96eHNrWmtUV0ZpUXYyWjJaX0ZvMHZ3NW9rTDdudlRLQS1FRFJTYVhmSXJCVktEWGExeFJlaVNqdUNYQ1FnTkZORE1TWkkzOUNEOGdyTE40V29FSnNCb0N4QzB5M0pZeG81UHAtajR3UzBLaDRhS0x2a2pjMk5NaEdhOVczbTVtWnRrbjdnaHdXZjBIWGV3YlJuTnBJc0RDYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is important for everyone, no matter your age.

The authors found that not exercising is a risk factor for 30 chronic conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, dementia, osteoporosis, dementia, depression and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By committing to 150-minutes of exercise each week, older adults can cut their risk of developing these conditions or slow down their progression if they do get diagnosed, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does an adequate amount of exercise help with general longevity and disease prevention, researchers found that by doing regular exercise, older adults are more able to perform necessary tasks that keep them functionally independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a statistic in this paper that said in 2014 ... one out of three older adults in the U.S. fall in any given year,” said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/phillip-yun" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Phillip Yun" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bb45e5e4b0249e5d5af0ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/phillip-yun" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Phillip Yun&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care sports medicine physician at UChicago Medicine. (Yun was not affiliated with the study.) A fall for someone who is young and healthy may not be a big deal, but for an older adult who may have less muscle strength or brittle bones, it can be hugely detrimental and lead to surgery, rehabilitation and a host of issues down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of complications that can be associated with something as innocuous as a simple fall,” Yun explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can help improve your balance, so you’re less likely to fall altogether, and can also bolster your bone and muscle health, so if you do fall, you’re less likely to get seriously hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that exercise can benefit your cognition. Exercise in older adults was found to lessen the chance of developing cognitive impairment and could help prevent Alzheimer’s disease as well. It’s also good for mental health and mood, and can help lessen the likelihood of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the difference between moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and vigorous exercise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="moderate aerobic physical activity includes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bb45e5e4b0249e5d5af0ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;moderate aerobic physical activity includes&lt;/a&gt; exercises like brisk walking, dancing, gardening and playing doubles tennis, but Yun said exactly what is moderate and what is vigorous varies from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good way to tell if you’re doing moderate aerobic physical activity is to try the “talk test” as you exercise. “The talk test basically is you’re not able to sing, but you’re still able to talk and complete sentences and have a full conversation — that is moderate aerobic physical activity,” Yun explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to measure your exercise intensity? Quantifying it. With moderate activity, you should feel like you’re exercising at a 5 or 6 on a 1 to 10 scale, Yun added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: andreswd via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;andreswd via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Walking can be a great moderate-intensity exercise to jump start your workout habit.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you add moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to your routine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t try to get in all 150 minutes of weekly exercise in one day. Instead, you should break that up into at least three days each week, Yun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes of exercise at a time is generally a good place for folks, he noted. But if you’re just entering your workout era, you could start with something small like a 10-minute walk twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I generally recommend for most people to start off with &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/walking" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bb45e5e4b0249e5d5af0ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/walking" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; because it has a low barrier of entry, and I think it’s something that you can often do on your own or with people,” Yun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If walking isn’t for you, Yun recommended you find something that you enjoy doing. This way, you’ll be more likely to continue the exercise as time goes on.

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 26, 8:55 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is speaking out on the recent outbreaks in multiple Washoe County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been digging all day trying to get answers and learned the number of schools impacted increased on Wednesday afternoon before the Washoe County School District reported a slight decrease on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 6:42 p.m. on Wednesday four Washoe County schools are on outbreak status, down from six reported Wednesday afternoon and five reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two are dealing with respiratory illness outbreaks, one with gastrointestinal, and one is dealing with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 20 classrooms are now in outbreak status. 15 of them for respiratory and five for gastrointestinal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been pressing the school district all day, but they tell us they will not release the names of the schools affected at this time. Northern Nevada Public Health tells us that's due to HIPAA policies. However, they say the families of the schools impacted have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liliana Wilbert, an epidemiologist for NNPH, says, "In order to protect the confidentiality of the schools and the families that are impacted we do not share that type of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of those affiliated with affected schools have reached out to 2 News Nevada to share that schools attended by their children have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email obtained by 2 News Nevada that was sent to parents at Van Gorder Elementary School said that the school has seen an increase in the number of students and staff members who have been absent or sent home due to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another email obtained by 2 News Nevada confirms that a STEM Night planned for Van Gorder Elementary on Tuesday was canceled and will be rescheduled due to the school being placed on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents at Rollan Melton Elementary reached out to 2 News Nevada about multiple instances of children suffering gastrointestinal issues, with more than a dozen said to have been sent home. While parents have reported illness at Rollan Melton, we have not been able to obtain any notice from the district formally naming it as a school on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District wants to make it clear that if families have not heard from them about their schools, then that means those schools are not impacted by an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says right now the respiratory illnesses they are seeing are RSV, influenza, and general influenza-like illnesses that are more commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is practicing its clean-up procedures for these illnesses. That includes removing all nearby individuals, cleaning and sanitizing contaminated areas, and keeping sick students and staff away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says if your child is starting to show any symptoms of illnesses they should stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, region-wide and not limited to schools, NNPH is reporting there are 187 RSV cases reported, 36 hospitalizations due to flu, and 19 deaths due to flu, two of those deaths being under the age of 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 26, 3:15 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting an increase in the number of schools and classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon the district announced that there are now six schools and 20 individual classrooms on outbreak status, up from five and 19 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six schools, one is on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, two are for gastrointestinal only, and three are for respiratory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 20 classrooms, 15 are on outbreak status for respiratory illness and five are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGINAL ARTICLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several schools and classrooms within the Washoe County School District are on outbreak status as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five entire schools and 19 classrooms are currently on outbreak status according to a WCSD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the schools is on outbreak status for both respiratory and gastrointestinal illness while there are two on outbreak status for respiratory illness and two for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 19 classrooms listed on outbreak status, 15 are for respiratory illness and four are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the specific schools and classrooms on outbreak status were not provided by the School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said in a statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 4 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 4 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death comes amid falling immunisation rates in the US and controversy over the appointment of vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/13/us-senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-as-health-and-human-services-leader?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;as the country’s top health official.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 130 measles cases have been reported in Texas and the neighbouring state of New Mexico this year, almost all of them in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials have said most of the cases have been concentrated in a community of followers of the Mennonite Christian sect, pockets of which are known for being wary of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the outbreak at US President Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/26/key-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-first-cabinet-meeting-with-elon-musk"&gt;first cabinet meeting on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy, who has promoted scientifically discredited research linking vaccines to autism, downplayed the outbreak as “not unusual”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country,” Kennedy told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, there were 16. So, it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases in the US hit a nearly two-decade peak of 1,274 in 2019, before plummeting during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities reported 285 cases in 2024, up from 59 in 2023 and 121 the year before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization declared measles eliminated from the US in 2000 – meaning no outbreaks had persisted for a year or more – but that status has come under threat in recent years amid growing anti-vaccine sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US last reported a measles-related death in 2015, after 12 years without a fatality linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be extremely dangerous for people who are not vaccinated, including young infants who are not usually eligible for immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated people in the US who get measles are hospitalised, and as many as one out of every 20 children with measles get pneumonia, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the first death from the disease in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. Texas health officials say the school-aged child, not vaccinated, and was hospitalized last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Alabama and Florida health officials are sounding the alarm. One Florida doctor tells WEAR News this current outbreak comes down to a nationwide decrease in vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With warmer weather on the horizon, Luke Seager says he looks forward to taking his 3-year-old son to the Bayfront Park. The growing measles outbreak could put those plans on pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would definitely be sad, you know, not being able to come to the park," said Seager. "The idea of your child getting sick is also pretty scary, especially with something pretty serious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Seager and other parents, the recent death of a young child due to measles hits close to home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports for the 2023, 2024 school year, just 88% of kindergarteners in Florida were vaccinated for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says 95% is needed for community-wide protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a little disconcerting that maybe there are some kids that could run around unvaccinated," said Seager. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports seven states with measles patients. There are no confirmed cases of the disease in Florida. Health officials across the nation and along the Gulf Coast say the growing numbers are call for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One out of 20 children can get pneumonia," said University of West Florida's Dr. Wesley Farr. "One out of 1,000 can get encephalitis or inflammation of the brain. And one to three out of every 1,000 children who get inflected with measles can die from complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farr specializes in infectious diseases. He says measles traditionally affects young children but they aren't the only ones at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adults can contract measles, if they didn't have it as a child or were not vaccinated," said Farr. "Measles in adults tends to be more severe than measles in children. The reason we hadn't seen many cases of serious measles in adults is that they either had it as a child or had the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farr says the fever, muscle aches and rash that stem from from the disease are all preventable. If you got the first version of the vaccine -- given between 1963 and 1968 -- or don't know which version of the vaccine you received, the CDC recommends at least one dose of the current vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency says if you were born before 1957 and have had measles, you likely have natural immunity. But, you should still check with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WEAR</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 03:42:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>FDA cancels pivotal advisory meeting about next season's flu vaccine - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPQjc0VUZod1RFWG94OFJ1ODQzWnpjd2I5enZnYXpsUTllSmtoem9LZDBXNnlvel9wUUY1SEdKdDA3aFVlTG9JbkpORFByenBjU3JiSU82R2xndUZzMXFUS2hHMHJjRVdLcWwwYXljWHlrc1ZKSTloTFNRbDluclgwZnZpVFhzUjV5VnV5eXNvTFIzT0d1QldIdzItUExfTGxhT0V30gGoAUFVX3lxTE90RlFyQmlHdUp2RDQ5U1lwbmJCcml6ZEF6RVZjWU9SemxSMm9BQ0NnMWVEaVFaOHg4NnNUUERDNmt6N29Na2gzemlZbzFhYjVtZldIWU1zOVl2cG96MHJwcVVkQjJfVFVONUo2TTd2ZjZoMlRDVkhqWV90b1Z2V2ktTkE1elhpNXFndDFkSHcyT1dydFJNc2tsNEtjc3ZLMENMVU1aSElNUA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting that was set to discuss what flu strains to include in next season's flu vaccine has been canceled, multiple sources told ABC News, leaving some to wonder if the meeting cancelation will delay next year's flu vaccine delivery schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;In this Oct. 14, 2015, file photo, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration campus is shown in Silver Spring, Md.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The meeting was canceled in an email sent from the FDA to members who were planning to attend the annual meeting in about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The high-profile, public meetings of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee are where independent experts review scientific data and vote on a variety of vaccine related issues.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky health officials have confirmed a measles case in the state on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials with the Kentucky Department of Public Health (KDPH) and the Franklin County Health Department said an adult "had recently traveled internationally to an area with ongoing measles transmission."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said the Kentuckian went to a gym while infectious, and they are working to contact anyone who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who went to the Planet Fitness on Allen Way in Frankfort on Monday, Feb. 17 from 9 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. may have been exposed health officials said. Anyone exposed and unvaccinated should quarantine for 21 days and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world,” KDPH Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack said. “Fortunately, measles can be prevented with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is safe and effective. Vaccines are an essential tool to keep children and adults safe and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles can cause serious health issues, especially in young children health officials said. It spreads through the air and can survive up to two hours after the infected person leaves an area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, and begins eight to 12 days after exposure health officials said. The rash typically appears three to five days after the initial symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials, the last confirmed case of measles in Kentucky was 2023.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Heat takes it out of you. After a long, hot day, we feel tired and grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sustained periods of heat do more than that – they age us faster. Cumulative heat stress changes our  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="153502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt; – how our cells turn on or off gene switches in response to environmental pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from the United States explores the pressing question of how extreme heat affects humans. The findings are concerning. The more days of intense heat a participant endured, the faster they aged. Longer periods of extreme heat accelerated ageing in older people by more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the climate heats up, humans will be exposed to more and more heat – and our bodies will respond to these stresses by ageing faster. These findings are especially pertinent to Australia, where heatwaves &lt;a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/"&gt;are expected&lt;/a&gt; to become more frequent and intense in a warmer world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How, exactly, does heat age us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ageing is natural. But the rate of ageing varies from human to human. As we go through life, our bodies are affected by stresses and shocks. For instance, if we don't get enough sleep over a long period, we will &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458022000264"&gt;age faster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While heat can directly sicken or kill us, it also has a long tail. Sustained heat &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0913352107"&gt;stresses our bodies&lt;/a&gt; and make them less efficient at doing the many jobs needed to stay alive. This is what we mean when we say it accelerates biological ageing. This deterioration is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21302421/"&gt;likely to precede&lt;/a&gt; the later development of diseases and disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that look like on a genetic level? You might think your genes don't change over your life, and this is mostly true (apart from random mutations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does change is how your genes are expressed. That is, while your DNA stays the same, your cells can switch some of its thousands of genes off or on in response to stresses. At any one time, only a fraction of the genes in any cell are turned on – meaning they are busy making proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics-and-health/epigenetics/index.html"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;. The most common and best understood pathway here is called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; (DNAm). Methylation here refers to a chemical our cells can use to block a DNA sequence from activating and producing proteins with various functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYHBbEKap0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular changes in DNAm can lead to proteins being produced more or less, which in turn can flow on to affect physiological functions and our health status. This can be both bad or good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat stress can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35413138/"&gt;alter the pattern&lt;/a&gt; of which genes are turned off or on, which in turn can affect our rate of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe heat stress can be remembered in cells, leading them to change their DNAm patterns over time. In laboratory testing, the effect is pronounced in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978736/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, chickens, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4769883/"&gt;guinea pigs&lt;/a&gt; and mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, much research on how heat affects epigenetics has focused on animals and plants. Here, the evidence is clear – even a single episode of extreme heat has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33037634/"&gt;been shown&lt;/a&gt; to have a long-lasting effect on mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only a couple of studies have been done involving humans, and they have been limited. This is the gap this new research is intended to help fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153506" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153506" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642.jpg" alt="Extreme Heat Accelerates Aging by Over Two Years, New Research Finds" class="size-full wp-image-153506" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153506" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sustained heat changes how our cells express genes – accelerating ageing. (BeritK/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by researchers at the University of Southern California involved almost 3,700 people, with an average age of 68 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat affects older people more than younger people. Our ability to control our body temperature drops as we age, and we are less resilient to outside stresses and shocks. We also know periods of extreme heat &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00635-w"&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; a wave of illness and death, especially among older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study set out to better understand what happens to human bodies at a biological level when they're exposed to intense heat over the short, medium and longer term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers took blood samples and measured  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="153502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; at thousands of sites across the genome, which were used to calculate three clocks measuring biological age, named PcPhenoAge, PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153508" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642.jpg" alt="Extreme Heat Accelerates Aging by Over Two Years, New Research Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-153508" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153508" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ageing is natural – but the speed at which we age can change. (Studio Brazil/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they looked at the levels of heat each participant would have been exposed in their geographic areas over the preceding six years, which was 2010–16. They used the US heat index to assess heat, from caution (days up to 32°C), extreme caution (32–39°C) and danger (39–51°C). They used regression modelling to see how much faster people were ageing over the normal rate of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of heat was clear in the three biological clocks. Longer term exposure to intense heat increased biological age by 2.48 years over the six year period of the study according to PCPhenoAge, 1.09 years according to PCGrimAge and 0.05 years according to DunedinPACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the period of the study, the effect was up to 2.48 years faster than normal ageing, where one calendar year equals one biological year of ageing. That is, rather than their bodies ageing the equivalent of six years over a six year period, heat could have aged their bodies up to 8.48 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the biological clocks differ quite substantially and we don't yet know why. The authors suggest the PCPhenoAge clock may capture a broader spectrum of biological ageing, covering both short term and longer term heat stress, while the other two may be more sensitive to long term heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way these researchers have conducted their study gives us confidence in their findings – the study sample was large and representative, and the use of the heat index rather than air temperature is an improvement over previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the findings don't account for whether the participants had airconditioning in their homes or spent much time outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We need to know more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, there has been little research done to date on what heat does to human epigenetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, we conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749119355812"&gt;systemic review&lt;/a&gt; of the science of how environment affects human epigenetics. We found only seven studies, with most focused on the effect of cold rather than heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have this new research which sheds light on the extent to which heat ages us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we face a warmer future, our epigenetics will change in response. There is still a lot of work to do to see how we can adapt to these changes – or if we even can, in some parts of the world.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250784/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year again, when everyone’s fighting a cold and blowing their nose. Maybe you’ve found yourself having sinus struggles, or you’ve noticed your boogers don’t look “normal.” Whatever the case may be, mucus abounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mucus is a natural product to keep our airways moist in regular times, and to work with our immune system to fight off an irritant, infection, or other inflammation in others,” said Dr. Stephen Vogel, a family medicine physician with PlushCare. “Normal mucus appears clear to white for most people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your boogers aren’t clear, then it’s possible something else might be going on, whether it’s allergies or something more serious. We spoke with doctors about what your boogers could be saying about your health, from the color to the consistency, and when you’ll want to see a doctor about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus usually means that your body is dealing with an infection. It’s often a direct result of the white blood cells fighting off a bacteria or virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yellow mucus also tends to become thicker and/or more concentrated when your body’s immune system is activated,” said &lt;a href="https://doctorconnor.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7835079" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Brynna Connor&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician and health care ambassador at NorthWestPharmacy.com. “The potential causes of yellow mucus include the common cold or a bacterial infection such as sinusitis (a sinus infection) or bronchitis (a respiratory infection).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Connor, green mucus can suggest you are suffering from a more serious bacterial infection. “The green color comes from enzymes that are released by the white blood cells as they fight infection and typically indicates a prolonged and/or more intense immune response,” Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some possible causes of green mucus include a bacterial sinus infection, bacterial bronchitis, or pneumonia. However, green mucus can also simply consist of boogers that have been in your sinuses for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING COUNTY, Wash. — At least two domestic, indoor cats were infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in King and Snohomish counties after eating potentially contaminated food linked to other &lt;a href="/article/news/health/cat-bird-flu-euthanized-multnomah-county-raw-pet-food-washington/283-48083bb3-64ac-4646-8f4d-7b064670d00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;illnesses in Oregon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cats was euthanized due to the severity of the illness. The other is being treated by a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Washington State Department of Agriculture, pet owners reported feeding the cats Wild Coast Raw food, which was &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=42075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;identified &lt;/a&gt;as a possible source of bird flu infection earlier in February. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presumptive positive results for both cats were reported by the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory on Monday, Feb. 24. The results were confirmed by a national lab Feb. 25.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pet food was previously linked to illnesses in cats in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of HPAI or H5N1, also known as bird flu, include lethargy, low appetite, fever, hypothermia, progression of illness to pneumonia, progression of illness to neurologic abnormalities and upper respiratory infection. The department of agriculture asks anyone whose pet has consumed Wild Coast Raw and has any of these symptoms to contact their veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no documented human cases of HPAI following exposure to an infected cat or contaminated raw food product, according to the department of agriculture. The strain currently circulating is considered low risk to humans, but that risk increases for those who handle contaminated raw food or care for infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts suggest people do the following to prevent contact with H5N1 or HPAI: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid a raw food diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep cats indoors and not allow them to ingest wild birds - which could be infected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit pets contact with bird feces and droppings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 virus has been ravaging bird populations throughout the U.S., including backyard and commercial farms. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Doctors in the US have treated a fetus with a rapidly progressive congenital disease from inside the womb for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving medicine to a child with severe neuromuscular complications &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they are born, a new case study details how a prospective mother agreed to take the medicine for her developing fetus while she was still pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prenatal test had shown that her fetus held two genetic mutations indicating type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which usually results in severe muscle weakness and breathing difficulties &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/spinal-muscular-atrophy"&gt;within six months of birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, most children with type 1 SMA die &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma"&gt;by their second birthday&lt;/a&gt;, usually from respiratory failure. However, the child in this study has so far made it to the age of two and a half years with no sign of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents of the treated child had previously experienced the loss of their baby to spinal muscular atrophy, and when testing showed their most recent fetus also had the progressive neuromuscular disease, they wanted to know if they could start treatments earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this single case, the FDA approved the early administration of the oral drug risdiplam, brand name Evrysdi, owned by the pharmaceutical company F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, randomized controlled &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-10-14"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown risdiplam to be both safe and effective at treating spinal muscular atrophy in newborns, and the younger the kids are when they start receiving the medicine, the better the outcomes overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the pregnant mother took a dose of risdiplam each day for six weeks before giving birth. Testing found that the medicine trickled right through her umbilical cord blood and the amniotic fluid bathing her fetus. After birth, it was the infant that was given the daily oral drug, not the mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric neurologist Michelle Farrar, who is working on a minimally invasive&lt;a href="https://kr.schn.health.nsw.gov.au/articles/2022/06/life-changing-clinical-trial-will-save-hundreds"&gt; gene therapy treatment&lt;/a&gt; for SMA in Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00534-0"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Smriti Mallapaty at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that the baby girl with SMA "has been effectively treated, with no manifestations of the condition" even 30 months after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153127" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-642x689.png" alt="Risdiplam" class="wp-image-153127 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-642x689.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-387x415.png 387w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-768x825.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-600x644.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492.png 773w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153127" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Risdiplam is sold under the brand name Evrysdi.

&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00367-7"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; funded by Roche, however, found the &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-10-14"&gt;majority of children&lt;/a&gt; with spinal muscular atrophy treated with risdiplam &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; six weeks of age could swallow, feed, sit, stand, and walk on their own after two years of treatment. None required permanent ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risdiplam works to prevent the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and body by increasing the concentration of a crucial protein, called survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Active SMN proteins are lacking in those with genetic mutations that cause spinal muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In children with SMA, motor neuron degeneration starts before the onset of symptoms, so time is of the essence if we hope to preserve muscle function," &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-10-14"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; pediatric neurologist Laurent Servais in a press release for a Roche  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's heartening to see that through early intervention with Evrysdi these children have achieved important milestones like sitting, standing, and walking that would typically be unattainable without treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the recent case study in the US will inspire and embolden doctors and parents to trial risdiplam at earlier stages of development remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Results in this single case cannot be generalized but may support the consideration of prenatal risdiplam treatment for SMA identified in utero," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2300802"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2300802"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the 2024-2025 flu season, drugmakers supplied the U.S. with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/vaccine-supply/vaxadmin.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for Americans who want to get a flu vaccine next season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA's strain selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-ordered-stop-working-immediately-upending-expectations-extended-wi-rcna189508" target="_blank"&gt;stop communicating with the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/24/us-who-flu-vaccine-meeting-london/" target="_blank"&gt;Stat News reported &lt;/a&gt;on Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" target="_blank"&gt;CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines, including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine, as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/" target="_blank"&gt;at-home nasal spray&lt;/a&gt; for influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, could undermine the vaccine regulatory process in the U.S., possibly leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier Wednesday, Texas health officials&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt; reported that an unvaccinated child in the state die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt; from the measles, the first death from the virus in a decade. An outbreak in the state has led to at least 124 cases, mostly in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;"It's a bad day for infectious diseases," said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children's Hospital who has advised the FDA on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNc3BHV19vczg2TDBjZzlIQkZOVnJhT2otbFR3Qkl2NmUxUUNieHdWVlFrWFNVYjJyZWVoV0lQbUs2VFhWLTFLSUJrT2xLSDVlMzNaemd2WFBRZW9jQlVDT0FLSURiNXBTLUxyX0JRRzczSHo4UHVqQi1HWlBDYUlkR0dqVnFuWHh3ZmlLZW0yemNQS2xSMlFPazdEdVo2UWUtcm5QYnpwRnNOZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE85Um83cGQ5UnNmMTJQUzljdjlSYmNDVS0yaHR0bVZ1dmpVTzB0RTR4eUFweHVBUGVlcmdhYzJWTzVDVEdUb2loYklxdWYwY1lBbUt5RVRR</guid></item><item><title>A Deadly Unidentified Disease Has Emerged in the DRC - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPbmx6S1dWLW01dmFRSDBqVzFIVnotSjRWRTRrMk84Z29EYXNVeVJiWUpwT2lCXzVqNk9OYVd0M3ZCdG15MXdZc1VzWmNsRmJTSmlLQXZqaF9FVm8xMFAtTm13MXppcjN1V3loUGVabDNqU001WUFpU1lIZVVJbWpYSzlIa194U2JCaUwyM2g5WEh1ZFRRTU43NFFpOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;A mysterious disease&lt;/span&gt; with Ebola-like symptoms has emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/disease-outbreaks/outbreaks-and-other-emergencies-updates"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the disease was first detected on January 21, and over the past five weeks hundreds have been infected and more than 50 people have died in the northwest of the country. Health officials are yet to determine the cause of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Initial investigations suggest the outbreak began in the village of Boloko, where three children died within days of eating the carcass of a bat. The symptoms of the infected include fever, headache, diarrhea, nosebleeds, vomiting blood, and general bleeding—which match the symptoms caused by viruses such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/ebola/"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and Marburg. However, experts have ruled out these pathogens after testing more than a dozen samples from suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In early February, health authorities recorded a second cluster of cases and deaths in the village of Bomate, several hundred kilometers away, though there is currently no known link between the clusters. As of February 15, when the WHO last reported on the outbreak, a total of 431 suspected infections had been reported, including 53 deaths. In most cases, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death was only 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Samples from 18 cases have been sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in the DRC's capital, Kinshasa, testing negative for the most common pathogens linked to hemorrhagic fever symptoms, although some tested positive for malaria. “The exact cause remains unknown, with Ebola and Marburg already ruled out, raising concerns about a severe infectious or toxic agent,” the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380529/OEW7-1016022025.pdf"&gt;WHO wrote&lt;/a&gt; in its most recent bulletin on the outbreak, stressing the urgent need to accelerate laboratory investigations, improve the management and isolation of those infected, and increase surveillance and risk communication. “The remote location and weak health care infrastructure increase the risk of further spread, requiring immediate high-level intervention to contain the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Disease outbreaks caused by pathogens in animals transferring to humans—a process known as zoonotic spillover—are becoming more common in Africa. Changing land use and climate change are two major drivers, as they can both increase contact between humans and pathogen-harboring wildlife. According to estimates &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/africa-63-jump-diseases-spread-animals-people-seen-last-decade"&gt;from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;, outbreaks of diseases transmitted from animals to people increased by 63 percent in Africa between 2012 and 2022. The continent has seen multiple outbreaks of mpox in recent years, as well as clusters of Ebola and Marburg cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Late last year, another mysterious illness killed more than 70 people in the southwest of the DRC, many of them children. Symptoms in that outbreak were flu-like, and most patient samples tested came back positive for malaria. The outbreak was later attributed to respiratory infections aggravated by malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.it/article/nuova-malattia-congo-mortale-non-identificata-pipistrelli/"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;Italia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Italian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:20:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPbmx6S1dWLW01dmFRSDBqVzFIVnotSjRWRTRrMk84Z29EYXNVeVJiWUpwT2lCXzVqNk9OYVd0M3ZCdG15MXdZc1VzWmNsRmJTSmlLQXZqaF9FVm8xMFAtTm13MXppcjN1V3loUGVabDNqU001WUFpU1lIZVVJbWpYSzlIa194U2JCaUwyM2g5WEh1ZFRRTU43NFFpOA</guid></item><item><title>CDC investigating hospitalizations of five people who recently received chikungunya vaccine - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNa3lYaW1FWGNySDVCWEZsTmhwcDhwUUJpcVk4RDFndmt5dzRKRldQdmJSQnE0NlR4clFtclkxSmo4bDhYbnctRWZNNWdPTmNGaDR3UGZJMDZUeFFZOXByNmUwbWJfdkdYRnBLdUE5eThmV0NTamsyMHRINDk4bndxVHNzWnFTRWZtcFpsM1ZrUUUtdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently investigating five hospitalizations that occurred in people who had recently received a vaccine that prevents disease caused by the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/hcp/vaccine/index.html#cdc_generic_section_3-vaccine-immunogenicity-and-side-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:notice posted Tuesday on a vaccine information page for health-care providers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;notice posted Tuesday on a vaccine information page for health-care providers&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said that the people, all 65 and older, were hospitalized for cardiac or neurologic events following vaccination with IXCHIQ, the only chikungunya vaccine currently licensed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CNN has reached out to the CDC for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya virus is typically spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c00093b6m0t1conn1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This topic will be discussed at an upcoming meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Healthcare providers should discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination with individual travelers based on their age, destination, trip duration, and planned activities,” the CDC’s online notice said in part.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The chikungunya vaccine and surveillance for adverse events originally were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to be discussed in an ACIP meeting Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, according to a draft meeting agenda, but that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;meeting has been postponed&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mdfc4f00103b6mp3h86ydu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and ACIP liaison, said the CDC investigation is an example of the agency’s vaccine surveillance system “working excellently and sending out a signal” in detecting rare events that might deserve further investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7me7xb700133b6m1fyj6ra1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And of course, the CDC and the local people who are taking care of these patients are working on that now, which is entirely appropriate. That’s the way the system is supposed to work,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7meeh8000163b6m6o6zfilc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Remember, we’re still trying to work out whether this is a causal relationship or a coincidental one,” he said about the investigation, in which he is not directly involved. “Let’s not draw any conclusions yet. That’s why they’re doing the investigation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000a3b6meozoh99e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/hcp/vaccine/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;IXCHIQ vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, administered as a single-dose shot into the muscle, contains a live, weakened version of the chikungunya virus. The vaccine, manufactured by the biotechnology company Valneva, was the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-prevent-disease-caused-chikungunya-virus" target="_blank"&gt;first vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus. The approval, in November 2023, was for people 18 and older who are at increased risk of exposure to chikungunya virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s recommended in a very restricted way to travelers who are going to countries where there is a current outbreak of chikungunya virus infection, and also to travelers who are going to countries who had experienced an outbreak within the past five years,” Schaffner said. “And also to laboratorians who work with the chikungunya virus in the laboratory.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000b3b6mx0ehk07r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN has reached out to Valneva for comment. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/173758/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;Prescribing information&lt;/a&gt; for the vaccine states, “Vaccination with IXCHIQ may cause severe or prolonged chikungunya-like adverse reactions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000c3b6m1w51yplq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chikungunya virus circulates in tropical and subtropical regions. In the United States, locally acquired infections have not been reported since 2019, according to the CDC. But cases and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks had been identified in more than 100 countries&lt;/a&gt; in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000d3b6m2eorbey1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,is%20recommended%20for%20some%20travelers." target="_blank"&gt;chikungunya infections&lt;/a&gt; include fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or rash, according to the CDC, and the best way to prevent chikungunya is to avoid mosquito bites. There are currently no medications to treat chikungunya, but infected people may feel better with rest, fluids and over-the-counter medications for pain and fever.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000e3b6mzjznmcne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Tuesday’s notice, the CDC said that common adverse reactions following vaccination that occurred in more than 10% of vaccinated people in clinical trials included tenderness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, fever and nausea. In some people, “severe or prolonged chikungunya-like adverse reactions” occurred.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7md8pl2000t3b6mz1fmyam4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chikungunya-like reactions included “fever, joint pain, headache, rash, and can also include cardiac and neurologic conditions which were serious in two cases,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in the clinical studies, said in an email Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000f3b6m42o2kalq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s notice encouraged health-care providers “to report all adverse events that might be caused by vaccination to the CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS),” by &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;submitting a report online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/uploadFile/index.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;using a PDF form&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mdc9bv000x3b6m5olzixx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The robust vaccine safety surveillance system often identifies extremely rare adverse effects of vaccines after approval,” said Barouch, an infectious disease expert not involved in the CDC investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000g3b6mgozo60v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the vaccine was approved in 2023, the FDA noted that its safety was evaluated in two clinical studies conducted in North America in which about 3,500 adults received a dose of the vaccine, with one study including about 1,000 participants who received a placebo. Severe chikungunya-like adverse reactions occurred in 1.6% of IXCHIQ recipients and none of the placebo recipients, according to the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 26, 8:55 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is speaking out on the recent outbreaks in multiple Washoe County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been digging all day trying to get answers and learned the number of schools impacted increased on Wednesday afternoon before the Washoe County School District reported a slight decrease on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 6:42 p.m. on Wednesday four Washoe County schools are on outbreak status, down from six reported Wednesday afternoon and five reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two are dealing with respiratory illness outbreaks, one with gastrointestinal, and one is dealing with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 20 classrooms are now in outbreak status. 15 of them for respiratory and five for gastrointestinal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been pressing the school district all day, but they tell us they will not release the names of the schools affected at this time. Northern Nevada Public Health tells us that's due to HIPPA policies. However, they say the families of the schools impacted have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liliana Wilbert, an epidemiologist for NNPH, says, "In order to protect the confidentiality of the schools and the families that are impacted we do not share that type of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of those affiliated with affected schools have reached out to 2 News Nevada to share that schools attended by their children have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email obtained by 2 News Nevada that was sent to parents at Van Gorder Elementary School said that the school has seen an increase in the number of students and staff members who have been absent or sent home due to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another email obtained by 2 News Nevada confirms that a STEM Night planned for Van Gorder Elementary on Tuesday was canceled and will be rescheduled due to the school being placed on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents at Rollan Melton Elementary reached out to 2 News Nevada about multiple instances of children suffering gastrointestinal issues, with more than a dozen said to have been sent home. While parents have reported illness at Rollan Melton, we have not been able to obtain any notice from the district formally naming it as a school on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District wants to make it clear that if families have not heard from them about their schools, then that means those schools are not impacted by an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says right now the respiratory illnesses they are seeing are RSV, influenza, and general influenza-like illnesses that are more commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is practicing its clean-up procedures for these illnesses. That includes removing all nearby individuals, cleaning and sanitizing contaminated areas, and keeping sick students and staff away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says if your child is starting to show any symptoms of illnesses they should stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, region-wide and not limited to schools, NNPH is reporting there are 187 RSV cases reported, 36 hospitalizations due to flu, and 19 deaths due to flu, two of those deaths being under the age of 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 26, 3:15 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting an increase in the number of schools and classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon the district announced that there are now six schools and 20 individual classrooms on outbreak status, up from five and 19 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six schools, one is on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, two are for gastrointestinal only, and three are for respiratory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 20 classrooms, 15 are on outbreak status for respiratory illness and five are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGINAL ARTICLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several schools and classrooms within the Washoe County School District are on outbreak status as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five entire schools and 19 classrooms are currently on outbreak status according to a WCSD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the schools is on outbreak status for both respiratory and gastrointestinal illness while there are two on outbreak status for respiratory illness and two for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 19 classrooms listed on outbreak status, 15 are for respiratory illness and four are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the specific schools and classrooms on outbreak status were not provided by the School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Unidentified illnesses in northwestern Congo have killed more than 50 people over the past five weeks, nearly half of them within hours after they felt sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks in two distant villages in Congo’s Equateur province began on Jan. 21 and include 419 cases and 53 deaths. Health officials still do not know the cause, or whether the cases in the two villages, which are separated by more than 120 miles (190 kilometers), are related. It’s also unclear how the diseases are spreading, including whether they are spreading between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mystery-illness-has-killed-more-than-50-people-in-congo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Mystery illness has killed more than 50 people in Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first victims in one of the villages were children who ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said this week. More infections were found in the other village, where at least some of the patients have malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outbreaks in two remote villages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illnesses have been clustered in two remote villages in different health zones of Equateur province, which is 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. More than two weeks later a second and larger outbreak was recorded in the village of Bomate, where more than 400 people have been sickened. According to WHO’s Africa office, no links have been established between the cases in the two villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, and one of the government experts deployed to respond to the outbreak, says the situations in the two villages are somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first one with a lot of deaths, that we continue to investigate because it’s an unusual situation, (and) in the second episode that we’re dealing with, we see a lot of the cases of malaria,” said Dr. Ngalebato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO Africa office said the quick progression from sickness to death in Boloko is a key concern, along with the high number of deaths in Bomate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo’s Ministry of Health said about 80 percent of the patients share similar symptoms including fever, chills, body aches and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these symptoms can be caused by many common infections, health officials initially feared the symptoms and the quick deaths of some of the victims could also be a sign of a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola, which was also linked to an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Ebola and similar diseases including Marburg have been ruled out after more than a dozen samples were collected and tested in the capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nurse-dies-from-ebola-in-uganda-as-country-declares-first-virus-outbreak-since-2022-health-ministry-says"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nurse dies from Ebola in Uganda as country declares first virus outbreak since 2022, health ministry says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said it is investigating a number of possible causes, including malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is being done in response?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo’s government says experts have been sent to the villages since Feb. 14, mainly to help investigate the cases and slow the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngalebato said patients have been responding to treatments that target the different symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote location of the villages has hindered access to patients while the weak health care infrastructure has made it difficult to carry out surveillance and manage patients. Such challenges are common in disease outbreaks in Congo. In December, an unknown illness killed dozens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest outbreaks, several victims died even before experts could even reach them, Ngalebato said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be an urgent action “to accelerate laboratory investigations, improve case management and isolation capacities, and strengthen surveillance and risk communication,” the WHO Africa office has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has been the largest bilateral donor to Congo’s health sector and has supported the training of hundreds of field epidemiologists to help detect and control diseases across the vast country. The outbreaks were detected as the Trump administration put a freeze on foreign aid during a 90-day review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a link to Congo’s forests?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where people regularly eat wild animals. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say this might be what is happening in Congo, which is home to about 60% of the forests in the Congo Basin, home to the largest expanse of tropical forest on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these viruses are viruses that have reservoirs in the forest. And so, as long as we have these forests, we will always have a few epidemics with viruses which will mutate,” said Gabriel Nsakala, a professor of public health at Congo’s National Pedagogical University, who previously worked at the Congolese health ministry on Ebola and coronavirus response programs.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s everything you need to know about the virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We’re following the &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/why-texas-measles-outbreak-may-be-the-tip-of-a-bigger-iceberg/" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles epidemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every day,” Kennedy said in response to a reporter’s question about the child’s death. The health secretary also said two people had died of the disease. A spokesman for the federal agency later clarified that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified only one death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The federal government is providing vaccines as well as technical and laboratory support in West Texas, but the state health department is leading the response, said Andrew Nixon, spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said through a spokesman that his office is in regular communication with the state health department and epidemiologists, and that vaccination teams are in the “affected area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“The state will deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,” said spokesman Andrew Mahaleris, calling the child’s death a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-oembed-type="raw-html" id="isolated-embed-2JUUOGCJINGYDDXJH5MTDI6MRI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The CDC has said it will provide only weekly updates on &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/texas-has-an-ongoing-measles-outbreak-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus/" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;the measles outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and has not yet updated its public webpage to reflect the child’s death. Texas health department data shows that a majority of the reported measles cases are in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The virus has largely spread among rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community, health department spokesperson Lara Anton said. Gaines County, which has reported 80 cases so far, has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — which is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases — is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old for the first shot, with the second coming between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-oembed-type="raw-html" id="isolated-embed-BXWXXSRIGZBRXGT4RXGHACWL2Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/18/kennedy-panel-will-examine-childhood-vaccine-schedule-after-promising-not-to-change-it/" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kennedy vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases, despite promises not to change it during his confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;By DEVI SHASTRI and AMANDA SEITZ of The Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

He had supplemental oxygen tubes protruding from his nostrils and his eyesight was impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At more than 700lbs, Mr Bockness was at an extremely heightened risk of death, but he had tried several diets – keto, Jenny Craig, fasting – and none helped him achieve lasting &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-0b6b6820-f489-11ef-842d-7dd8dafca18c"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Desperate and swayed by online success stories, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14202365/carnivore-red-meat-diet-year-effects.html"&gt;he limited his diet&lt;/a&gt; even further. Now, Mr Bockness eats only eggs, bacon, beef, lamb, butter, salt, and vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six months, he lost 205 pounds, mainly due to fluid loss from his inflamed condition. He also said his health issues disappeared; his heart rate decreased from 107 to 68 beats per minute, and his severely swollen calves recovered. He's ultimately lost 270lbs since 2022, bringing his weight down to around 450.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this diet isn’t for everyone, and even his doctor wasn't convinced it was a sustainable way of life, and in fact believed it would be fatal. Mr Bockness added his medical team was ‘astounded’ when the diet didn’t kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Relying &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13671079/I-ditched-veganism-carnivore-diet-eat-steak-day-health-benefits-amazing.html"&gt;solely on meat&lt;/a&gt; for nutrition deprives the body of key nutrients in produce and whole grains. It means &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14417279/warning-carnivore-diet-kidney-disease-stones-weight-loss.html"&gt;eating a lot of saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, which raises cholesterol. High cholesterol, or the waxy, fatty substance that builds up in the arteries, increases the odds of suffering a heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the highly restrictive diet – which eliminates all sugar, refined grains, and processed foods – is exceedingly popular for helping people feel full while still losing weight, because the lack of carbohydrates forces the body to burn fat for energy rather than glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His doctors told him he would likely die because of this, but Mr Bockness, of Bozeman, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/montana/index.html" id="mol-881b7620-f48a-11ef-842d-7dd8dafca18c" class=""&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, said: ‘If I hadn’t done carnivore, I would already be dead, I wouldn’t have made it this far.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At more than 700 lbs,Todd Bockness couldn’t walk on his own. He had supplemental oxygen tubes protruding from his nostrils. His eyesight was impaired due to intractable insulin problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The carnivore diet excludes all carbohydrates, contributing to weight loss and improving insulin levels. A diet high in protein helps the body feel fuller for longer and requires more energy to digest, translating to more calories burned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bockness had struggled with food and his weight his whole life, having been obese as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘My weight fluctuated up until I was about 38, and then my health started catching up on me. I got pretty sick.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point in 2021, his body began retaining fluid as a result of inflammation throughout his body and potential liver or kidney damage. It caused him to gain 84 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘I ballooned to well over 700 pounds, couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After first trying the keto diet, which includes plant-based foods, Bockness became a full-fledged carnivore in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I only drink water or carbonated water. I only eat eggs, bacon, beef, lamb, butter, salt, and vinegar,’ Mr Bockness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For half the week, he eats one or two meals a day. The other half, he fasts, using his body fat for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The carnivore diet has exploded in popularity in recent years, with more than 3.5billion views on TikTok as of February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Bockness lost about 270lbs while following an all animal protein diet for about three years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bockness is pictured before embarking on the carnivore diet, when, at his highest, he weighed over 700lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of Americans have reported the diet spurs weight loss, alleviates joint pain, improves energy levels, reduces bloating and IBS symptoms, clears acne, and improves sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bockness, for his part, saw his vision fully restored. High blood sugar over a long period of time can damage the eyes, causing vision to become blurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After dropping about 200 lbs, he was able to walk again. He was also able to breathe better and no longer needed supplemental oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But his doctors were still concerned about the myriad of documentable health risks of eating an animal protein-only diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: “[My doctor] wasn’t happy. He just said, “Oh, I’m worried about your diet.” That was the first time that guy had ever mentioned my diet when I was over 700 pounds on oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was breathing on my own and was able to walk again. He said he was worried about my diet.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The carnivore diet excludes all carbohydrates, contributing to weight loss and improving insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its benefits are largely anecdotal, as most available research comprises small studies and case reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In six months, he lost 205 pounds, mostly from fluid due to inflammation. His health improved—his heart rate dropped from 107 to 68, and his swollen calves healed. He eventually lost 270 pounds, reaching about 450&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bockness had struggled with food and his weight his whole life, having been obese as a child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet high in protein helps the body feel fuller for longer and requires more energy to digest, translating to more calories burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The associated weight loss could come at the expense of the person’s health, though. A primary concern with the carnivore diet is the potential deficiencies in crucial nutrients including fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2025 nutritional analysis of 2,000 people following the carnivore diet showed certain nutrients, such as riboflavin, vitamin B12, and zinc, were at recommended levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they were deficient in key nutrients, including thiamine, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, and folate.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An all-meat diet also means a high intake of saturated fat, which causes a build up of cholesterol, posing risks to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As cholesterol builds up in the blood vessels, it restricts blood flow to the heart and other organs. Over time, cholesterol buildup on arterial walls creates unstable plaque that inflames the area around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These plaques harden over time, further stiffening the arteries. In some cases, the plaques can rupture, causing a blood clot that can block the artery completely, causing a stroke or heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Bockness is not convinced of the risk, though, and will keep on with the carnivore diet until he reaches his goal weight of 280 lbs, saying that ‘the medical schools... all these companies that own all these drug companies paid for all the epidemiology studies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:43:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNYTNwcUUwU3R3bFFwM2ZGVTV2bW9xdm9URzFsWEQxM1BhMEtVZmtrZWRGTkZ5MmMtOFg3cl9uX1hkaGpJa2tialdsVTR6TGhLUEtscFJ6dDkyWmF3ZnczcVpGeXZsUjktZUlPWlpGSVN5eUZGVFhoLXNmaWNiU3BsTzlWZlhJLVFXQVZRSnNlZy1SUFQ2RVHSAZsBQVVfeXFMTldDSllPbEVqcEFQaWZ6QjZwREpTSlRWb25xTXZVMlF4dTRESTU1REpQMVdrNk5sUFMtR0dfd1FWbHZteW92RTBrc1RxckZmOV9GWVF1MnNYbElrYWhiMUh4YWRCUFotT2h6NDhJMVp1cmpjT2g3VWdxcXdWYTFhZUNIM1ZhQkVxdVFIUURKZHptUnJVdzJfazRIc00</guid></item><item><title>This Much Exercise Could Lower Dementia Risk by 41%, New Study Suggests - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9MbTNfdVljTTVac1ZqcU5yV25ZazIwVVlBb2tmUnVYa1NoejROZHhEdzVSSDM1OU1IcWhTMnZISGI2QmRRUmxTaGZ5dFNjdE5KdVUxZl96ZXdxdkZ6U2kxWno4YmFrU25QM2trVThQQlpoOXd2QVR1VFJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s no secret that exercise has many benefits. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/total-exercise-matters-more-than-number-of-days-8725667" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that found that regular physical activity reduced the risk of more than 200 diseases—even when it was squeezed into a couple of days as opposed to spreading it throughout the week. Included among those 200 diseases was dementia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is an umbrella term for a condition that affects someone’s ability to think, remember and make decisions in everyday life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of all dementia cases. Unfortunately, dementia is on the rise in America—approximately 6.7 million U.S. adults have Alzheimer’s disease and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;that number is expected to double&lt;/a&gt; by the year 2060.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dementia is incurable, it may be preventable (or at the very least, it can be slowed down and delayed). Exercise is one of the health habits that can help—and a new study suggests that just a few minutes each week can help more than you may realize. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health set out to try to clear up some of the unknowns. They published their findings in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what they found and how you can apply their findings to your life.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers pulled data from the UK Biobank, a large, long-running study in the United Kingdom that collects data from over 500,000 people. The information includes demographics—including age, sex, socioeconomic status and education level—and health information—like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI and medical history. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were voluntarily recruited into the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010. The purpose of the Biobank is to help advance modern medicine and foster a deeper understanding of disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Between February 2013 and December 2015, a subsample of 106,053 participants accepted the invitation to wear an accelerometer on their wrist for seven days. An accelerometer is similar to a smartwatch and tracks all activity, including how vigorous it is and for how long. The information gathered from the accelerometers was recorded in the Biobank.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this current study, researchers chose 89,667 of the 106,053 accelerometer participants who met their criteria. At the time they wore the accelerometer, the average age of the participants was 63; 56% were women and 59% of the total participants reported no chronic disease or frailty. These participants were followed for just over four years on average. During that time, 735 of them were diagnosed with dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the accelerometer data, they also collected demographic and medical information for the almost 90,000 participants. This included diagnoses of both dementia and frailty. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frailty is based on five factors: low hand-grip strength, slow walking speed, unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion and low self-reported physical activity. Participants were then labeled as being robust (0 factors for frailty), prefrail (1 to 2 factors for frailty) or frail (3 or more factors). The reason frailty was observed is because it’s associated with a higher risk of dementia. Plus, people experiencing frailty tend to be less active. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the minimum amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to reduce the risk of dementia. A secondary goal of this study was to assess whether the association between MVPA and dementia differed based on frailty status.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several statistical analyses were run, including adjusting for certain confounding factors (like the demographics). Researchers found that compared to those with no MVPA:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engaging in one to 35 minutes of MVPA per week was associated with a 41% reduced risk of dementia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in 36 to 70 minutes of MVPA per week was associated with a 60% lower risk of dementia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in 71 to 140 minutes of MVPA per week was associated with a 63% reduced risk of dementia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in more than 140 minutes of MVPA per week was associated with a 69% decreased risk of dementia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When considering frailty status, researchers found no difference between those labeled robust and those labeled frail. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This suggests that even frail or nearly frail older adults might be able to reduce their dementia risk through low-dose exercise,” says Amal Wanigatunga, Ph.D, M.P.H., one of the lead study authors and an ​​assistant professor in the John Hopkins Bloomberg School’s Department of Epidemiology, in a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These study authors note that the official physical activity guidelines endorsed by the Department of Health and Human Services—at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week—are unattainable for some people, including those who are frail.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, this study suggests that anything more than one minute of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity has some benefits regarding dementia prevention. In other words, every little bit counts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This concept may be difficult if you struggle with an all-or-nothing mindset. If you’re the kind of person who might give up on working out for the day if you don’t have time to do your full workout routine, try to let go of that habit. Just because you can’t get in a full hour or 30 minutes at the gym doesn’t mean it’s not worth exercising in the little time you do have. Having such a fixed mindset may eventually show up as unbelief in your ability to prevent disease or to exercise properly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Does that sound familiar? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When implementing any new habit, it’s important to begin with where you’re at. Sounds like common sense, but so many of us try to start at the end goal—which usually ends up in quickly burning out. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using physical activity as an example, if you’re currently averaging way under the recommended 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week but you decide to start there—say, by walking 20 to 25 minutes every day—you might last a few days and most likely will quickly resort to old habits. It’s not your fault. It’s just how our brains work. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if your goal is to hit that 150 minutes a week and you start with something smaller—like a 15-minute walk three times a week—and slowly increase from there, you’re more likely to meet your goal over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that this isn’t the only study to suggest that there are benefits to moving in smaller amounts than the guidelines recommend. Another &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/stair-climbing-heart-attack-study-8733002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;study we reported on&lt;/a&gt; suggests that climbing 60 to 100 steps a day—about four to eight flights of household stairs—can significantly reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. This can be done by intentionally being less efficient. For example, instead of carrying the entire laundry basket upstairs, take just a few items at a time to get more stairs in. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How about the study that suggests &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/total-exercise-matters-more-than-number-of-days-8725667" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercising just once a week&lt;/a&gt; can reduce your diabetes risk? These examples show that little changes to your routine can really make a difference in the long run. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, yes, many studies show that for disease prevention, you will enjoy some protection with almost any amount of physical activity—because it’s about the cumulative effect over time. It’s important to note, however, that while it doesn’t take much physical activity to reduce disease risk, if you want to improve your fitness level you need to engage in a higher amount of physical activity. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that any amount of physical activity may help reduce the risk of dementia, regardless of the level of frailty. You can get a head start on preventing dementia by making physical activity a habit now, since changes in the brain leading to Alzheimer’s begin decades before symptoms show up. Besides physical activity, we also know that an anti-inflammatory diet that includes plenty of fiber, healthy fats and antioxidants also contributes to reduced dementia risk, as does getting plenty of quality sleep, managing your stressors and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spending time with family and friends&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'There are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not unusual,' he added. 'We have measles outbreaks every year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. There was a rise in cases, however, in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senator Ron Wyden, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/democrats/index.html" id="mol-32412c00-f48e-11ef-b357-3f8ece99cf70"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-324809d0-f48e-11ef-b357-3f8ece99cf70"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; who tried to block RFK Jr.'s confirmation, slammed the health secretary's response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nothing about kids dying from measles is normal. Anti-vaxxers like RFK Jr. and the Republicans who enable them are responsible for every single one of these deaths,' Wyden wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health and  Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (second from left) at President Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congressman Herb Conaway, a Democrat from New Jersey who's a medical doctor, also had strong words for Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A child just died of measles - the first on mainland U.S. in a decade. I'm not surprised that RFK Jr. doesn't find this unusual. His anti-vaccine advocacy led to measles deaths in American Samoa,' he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor who was a key vote in getting Kennedy confirmed, expressed his concern about the cases but made no mention of Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Absolutely devastating news. Encouraging parents to make sure their child is up-to-date on their vaccines. The measles vaccine is safe and effective,' he wrote on X. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles is very serious and contagious, and it's important to make sure you and your child are up to date on vaccines. This is especially important for pregnant women,' he noted in an earlier post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kennedy, who is a fervent anti-vaxxer, made no mention of the measles vaccine, which is proven effective against the disease. He also made no mention of a federal response. State officials in Texas have taken the lead on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The school-aged child, who was not vaccinated, had been hospitalized and died Tuesday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death is the first attributed to measles in the U.S. since 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is facing its largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years with 124 cases seen across nine counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also spread into &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-mexico/index.html" id="mol-9834a400-f2af-11ef-a419-b9d4964cd120" class=""&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, with nine cases confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14422449/Pediatrician-working-heart-Texas-measles-outbreak-warns-just-beginning-cases-surging-90.html"&gt; highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In extreme cases, measles can cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-cb5817c0-f3ab-11ef-88ae-edf31e4f2435"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and may lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Members of the medical community took to social media to criticize Kennedy's leadership on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Alastair McAlpine, a pediatrician, wrote on X: 'Astonishing lack of leadership. In the face of a measles epidemic affecting mostly unvaccinated people, the correct response is to encourage vaccination!' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr. Nathan Boonstra pointed out a hospital wouldn't quarantine a measles patient because the disease is highly contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the kind of antivax misinfo to expect from him. People can quarantine at home, hospitals do not want you there infecting the vulnerable if you don't have to be there,' he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A sign reading 'measles testing' is seen as an outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, has raised concerns over its spread to other parts of the state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kennedy, as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency responsible for the response to epidemics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also appeared to misspeak at the Cabinet meeting, saying two people had died of the disease. A spokesman for the federal agency later clarified to the Associated Press that the CDC has identified only one death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus has been mostly seen in the rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas with several in the Mennonite community, state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gaines County, which has reported 80 cases so far, has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccination rate for the country was near 95% for 10 years before dropping to about 93% starting in 2020 during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — which is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases — is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old for the first shot, with the second coming between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine became available in 1963. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the decade before, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years old, according to the CDC. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, per the CDC, which notes: 'This was thanks to a highly effective vaccination program in the United States, as well as better measles control in the Americas region.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:28:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNM05HbS1tZE9Uci1hdU43SUJOMFFTNTRiZjNlOE1PeXJfMVdDS2lIdmhNemVqWWJodHpLc2NzQmx2TENVMGtBS2k4bG1yWko0UXNQRDFYd1l0d0hLcXZ1eU9vdEx1R0k0XzVic2t2UWZwRkNHZEtRSXhJQTVFWjJYNTNkb1B5S3J4T2RYUXZqX0ZOTk010gGaAUFVX3lxTFBZUXFxMHNjU0duR2VMTmE4UDhWMGlMekRLNzVKSzk4cmhuQ2tpcGZLaGh6NGlEWUFaRUZEZE1RajEtX2pvR0hJMURsTGhuRzVnQmNSVmdnZUlNVklTQklYVDdIRGQtaGZ0S3pjSEdMUE9mUVpNdHhyenFWWGtabjdsWm93VjZTNmp4bjQ5eGYwVWdHcTBpaERiVWc</guid></item><item><title>Your takeout containers could cause congestive heart failure — even without microwaving them - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPTnk5WE51dU9Jcy1fUlB3akgzWThKRlBDVWJNYnZMZkFqOElFY2dFX2xCbGpZZ0tUTFFlTjVXVUVWam9XcXR2ZWpCb2Nhb0lsZjNVd1JhVUJtNkFyTS1sUWNmWU5tc3NzUGt3bk8yN3ozSzJ5M0NDXzlGaS1ndzZObGJhS2pLdGhUNzlqZVRsNDRHY2RqbDVCTFFQT0tlQUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;After a long day at work, there’s nothing better than coming home, kicking off your shoes and ordering some tasty, warm takeout. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593#sec0150" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; out of China suggests that simply placing hot food into plastic takeout containers could give you heart problems — even if you don’t &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/health/the-hidden-health-hazard-lurking-in-your-office-microwave/"&gt;microwave&lt;/a&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted experiments on rats, exposing them to water that had been boiled and placed in plastic takeout lids for different durations — one, five and 15 minutes — over a period of three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were alarming — regardless of how long the plastic had been in contact with hot liquid, the rats experienced significant disruptions in the gut biome, including inflammation, which increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/15/health/first-of-its-kind-drug-can-reduce-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered significant damage to the myocardial — or heart muscle — leading them to conclude that “high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/23/health/doctor-reveals-3-symptoms-that-may-indicate-a-weak-heart/"&gt;congestive heart failure&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Since the plastic exposure came only from placing hot liquid in the containers — without any microwaving — this study suggests that simply eating hot food from plastic takeout containers may be enough to increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement this data, the researchers also asked 3,200 people to complete a survey about their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;exposure to plastic&lt;/a&gt; and their cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that those who frequently ate from plastic containers seemed to have more heart problems, particularly congestive heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has some shortcomings. First, researchers could not assess precisely which plastics the rats had in their bodies, nor did any of the rodents develop full-scale cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the human study was based on self-reported findings rather than lab results, and the researchers acknowledge that the link between the takeout containers and the cardiovascular symptoms could be due to other factors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, this is the latest evidence suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722069340" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;microplastics in food service&lt;/a&gt; can cause serious health problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors acknowledged that “further research is necessary to elucidate the health impacts of long-term exposure to plastic products.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, while it might sound extreme, they recommended that “in the meantime, to prevent ongoing harm from plastic products to human health, it is essential to avoid using plastic containers for high-temperature food.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep could be key to forestalling slow declines in brain health that may one day lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152995" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their 2023 study of 62 older, cognitively healthy adults, researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley, Stanford University, and UC Irvine in the US found individuals with brain changes associated with Alzheimer's performed better on memory function tests as they got more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was irrespective of education and physical activity, two factors along with social connection known to contribute to cognitive resilience in older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with similar Alzheimer's-linked changes who failed to get as much deep sleep didn't fare quite as well on the same tests. &lt;span&gt;By comparison, sleep made little difference to those individuals with few deposits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results, which were published in May 2023, imply having a generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory getting dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer's disease pathology," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of California (UC) Berkeley neuroscientist Matthew Walker.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/an-elderly-woman-sleeping-8527648/"&gt;Ron Lach/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study echoes &lt;a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2020/sep/sleep-apnea-alzheimers"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; which has found a build-up of amyloid-beta proteins in the brains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/link-between-alzheimer-s-disease-and-sleep-apnea-discovered-in-brain-tissue"&gt;people with disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But poor sleep is both a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;risk factor for&lt;/a&gt; and a symptom of Alzheimer's disease, making it tricky to tease apart cause and effect. Likewise, clumpy amyloid-beta proteins might only be a sign of Alzheimer's disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;not its root cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, levels of amyloid-beta proteins are commonly used as a marker of Alzheimer's disease, as research suggests they – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-find-biological-changes-visible-up-to-30-years-before-alzheimer-s-symptoms-appear"&gt;another protein called tau&lt;/a&gt; – can start clogging up brain cells decades before symptoms of the disease arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research from Walker's group found significant levels of amyloid-beta aggregating in the brains of older adults can disrupt deep sleep – also known as non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep – and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4035"&gt;impair memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some folk appear to stave off the decline that comes with Alzheimer's disease, even when levels of amyloid-beta proteins are relatively high. To find out why, Walker and colleagues monitored participants' brain waves as they slept, and then asked them to complete a memory test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those whose brain scans revealed similarly high levels of beta-amyloid deposits, getting a good night's sleep seemed to make a critical difference in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect was only seen when the researchers looked specifically at non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep, and not at other sleep wave frequencies or sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg" alt="Illustration of Brains " class="size-full wp-image-143046" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-434x415.jpg 434w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-600x574.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In people with similar amounts of beta-amyloid protein deposits, more deep sleep corresponded with improved memory function. (&lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;Matthew Walker/UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term studies in older adults are needed to test whether increasing deep sleep over a number of years can actually help preserve a person's cognitive function in that time, even as levels of amyloid-beta increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research adds to scores of studies suggesting that sleep could be a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00146/full"&gt;modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, one that could potentially forestall molecular changes by giving the brain time to clean up waste products that accumulate during the day. It also points to sleep quality being important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a certain level of brain pathology, you're not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UC Berkeley neuroscientist and lead author Zsófia Zavecz &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the study findings in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people may display molecular changes indicating a progression toward Alzheimer's disease, Zavecz says their findings suggest lifestyle factors can help buffer against those effects. "One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep," she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, though small, also hints at why getting good sleep naturally might be a better option than taking sleeping pills to get some shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research shows users of sleeping pills &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sleeping-pill-may-reduce-the-build-up-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;appear to have lower levels of amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; in their cerebrospinal fluid, which washes the brain clean at night. But these medications come with side effects; they may also lull people into shallow bouts of sleep rather than deep sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, to set yourself up for a good night's sleep, Zavecz suggests cutting out  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="152995" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; late in the day, doing some exercise, avoiding screen time, and taking a hot shower before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you snooze, rest assured scientists are working hard to figure out the knotty problems of Alzheimer's disease, which affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in May 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But don't count it out too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Blue light is vilified sometimes,” Dr. Winter says. “While there is a problem with being exposed to blue light before you go to bed, there is technically nothing wrong with blue light in general.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-help-with-sleep-in-older-adults" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does it help with sleep in older adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The study just found a link between morning blue light exposure and better activity and sleep, but experts say there’s likely a major reason why an early dose of this light wavelength was helpful: “[It] can help regulate your circadian rhythm,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/giacomina-massaro-giordano" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/giacomina-massaro-giordano" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mina Massaro-Giordano," class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Mina Massaro-Giordano,&lt;/a&gt; MD, co-director of the Penn Dry Eye and Ocular Surface Center and a professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with this term, your circadian rhythm is your body’s natural 24-hour cycle. It helps regulate a slew of physiological and behavioral processes in your body, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). Exposure to light and darkness have the biggest impact on your circadian rhythm, per the NIH. Essentially, these two modes can signal to your body that it's time to get up or to wind down for bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So, in the morning, blue light can be helpful. Dr. Winter even calls it "awesome." Why? “It can help your body wake up for the day," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;And it's &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; helpful for older adults due to biological changes that affect our eyes' light receptors, says study co-author &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen__;!!Ivohdkk!mK2T8FqX4tcxIeIjjZBG1qNqDurLDLRg0ElnoVyW6XKdduL7enyqxtvyWuqfEmzgk7P1yffQHkS2wLjkneGEWA$" title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen__;!!Ivohdkk!mK2T8FqX4tcxIeIjjZBG1qNqDurLDLRg0ElnoVyW6XKdduL7enyqxtvyWuqfEmzgk7P1yffQHkS2wLjkneGEWA$" data-outlook-id="8bdd4a2f-3d19-470f-af14-3167edc7d734" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen__;!!Ivohdkk!mK2T8FqX4tcxIeIjjZBG1qNqDurLDLRg0ElnoVyW6XKdduL7enyqxtvyWuqfEmzgk7P1yffQHkS2wLjkneGEWA$" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daan van der Veen" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Daan van der Veen&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, senior lecturer in Sleep and Chronobiology at the University of Surrey. "Normally, our circadian clocks stay synchronized with the day-night cycle through special blue light receptors in our eyes," he says. "But as we age, our ability to perceive this light declines due to natural changes like yellowing or clouding of the eye’s lens and a loss of light-sensitive cells in the retina."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For older adults, early morning blue light exposure may help support good sleep and activity, van der Veen says. "This may not work for everybody, [but] it does give real-world evidence that this simple and affordable approach could potentially help many people enjoy better sleep as they age, just by making sure they get the right kind of light at the right time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-help-with-activity-in-older-adults" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does it help with activity in older adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It’s all linked, Dr. Winter says. What he means is that being exposed to blue light in the morning can help reinforce the message going to your brain and body that it’s time to get up and be active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If you wake up in the morning and sit in a dark house, it doesn’t allow your brain to understand that it’s daytime,” Dr. Winter says. But getting an early hit of blue light can help signal that you should get moving, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-i-get-more-blue-light-exposure" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I get more blue light exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While this study used special lights, Dr. Winter says that getting out in the sun or even sitting near a light window during the day can also give you a dose of blue light. And he recommends doing what you can to get that sunlight exposure early. Try opening your shades as soon as you get up or eating breakfast next to a window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just keep in mind that blue light exposure at night can throw your circadian rhythm off, so it's best to avoid scrolling on your phone or working on your computer before you hop in bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

Older people living in hotter areas of the US showed faster aging at the molecular level than people living in cooler areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The study looked at measures of a person’s biological, or epigenetic, age, which is based on how a person’s body is functioning at the molecular and cellular levels and doesn’t necessarily match a person’s chronological age based on birth. Longer-term exposure to heat was associated with an increase in a person’s biological age by up to 2.48 years. The impact on the body is comparable to the effects of smoking, according to the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Extreme heat is already the&lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt; deadliest type of weather disaster&lt;/a&gt; in the US, a threat that’s growing as climate change leads to &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/heat-waves-and-climate-change/"&gt;more frequent and intense heatwaves&lt;/a&gt;. The new research shows how there are more subtle, insidious ways that prolonged heat exposure can affect the body beyond heat illness or stroke in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;The impact on the body is comparable to the effects of smoking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“We’re kind of surprised [at] how massive this impact could be,” says Eun Young Choi, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral associate at the University of Southern California. “The effects of extreme heat might not show up right away as a diagnosable health condition, but it could be taking a silent toll at the cellular and the molecular level which could years later develop into disability and disease.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The research included blood samples collected from 3,686 adults aged 56 or older living across the US. The study authors compared those samples with heat index data, a measure of temperature and humidity, between 2010 and 2016. They found a correlation between greater exposure to extreme heat and a bigger jump in epigenetic age. A person living in a place where the heat index is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above for half the year experienced up to 14 more months of biological aging compared to someone living somewhere with less than 10 days a year that hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“The thing that is interesting here is that a lot of observational data focuses on acute impacts of extreme heat exposure – this paper underlines that there may be chronic impacts on epigenetic age that are important predictors of adverse health,” Amruta Nori-Sarma, deputy director of Harvard Chan C-CHANGE and assistant professor of environmental health and population sciences says in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Nori-Sarma and Choi say it’s important to keep in mind, however, that the study doesn’t take into consideration whether a person had access to air conditioning or other ways to stay cool. There’s room for more research into what factors might make an individual more resilient or more vulnerable to heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“Our finding doesn’t necessarily mean that every person living in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, has an older biological age. This is really an average impact,” Choi says. “Two people in the same neighborhood could have very different levels of personal exposure depending on whether they have air conditioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;That also shows that there are steps that can be taken to keep people safe in a warming world. Aside from stopping climate change, that can look like planting more trees and painting rooftops white to &lt;a href="/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;prevent urban areas from trapping as much heat&lt;/a&gt;, and opening up more public spaces where people can get access to air conditioning. Finding solutions gets easier to do when people are more aware of the potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Verge</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:43:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPbVllUjdIWkJuWEdHVUVOU2VXcUZGYUVaOE16ZU9CQW82b1hBSE5lTVZQdU9mdVZZVEkwbU0zMlVyNHBGTDRkN2tLNVl6Z3pEUXN2NU9XVzFWLS1wTjN2UWJMdkdVTVZPQnFwYlVqekZyWGVtOWlvUGtFWm9ERTdWOQ</guid></item><item><title>This is the worst flu season in 15 years.

Precautions like social distancing and face mask use, while critical in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, led to fewer influenza cases during the pandemic and therefore fewer antibody development in individuals to protect against subsequent flu seasons like the one occurring now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:43:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE52eXVlSl91bndNTWxMV0tORDJVYXpHdi03Sm5zWjlzdVJacjRFdUJCRzBaLWZ4eEdOTlB2Uk1Cc3pnTDJRLTFqZVRCb1pzRHd0NTRXMlE1WUM3YnQtNGY1U1ZJMWlqcC13VjJ3N1NPal9aaWV4MnR5U1FQZ3k</guid></item><item><title>Texas child is first reported US measles death in a decade as outbreak hits more than 130 people - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQMU5DWUNxUFRpYTd6UzdMMEJ1S0xsWmRDV1R1VUp3cHY1d2xIM3lXR3plczc1NUtGXzlXUnozZ2lhcE9kcnlYcVZTTGozS0k2WWlpMmVtMU5rV0pabWpNU19STGhqcTlObVB5RHVxa0xiVmZGckFRRkpDLXFmcE5iN3c2MHJUTzRRNW01ZEhLbHdBN1RTdkhoOXhSbmJpTWI0cHA0N2U4WlFXYVh2OWh4Q1NVeVE2R29nT3cySkh1b3ZKZWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQMU5DWUNxUFRpYTd6UzdMMEJ1S0xsWmRDV1R1VUp3cHY1d2xIM3lXR3plczc1NUtGXzlXUnozZ2lhcE9kcnlYcVZTTGozS0k2WWlpMmVtMU5rV0pabWpNU19STGhqcTlObVB5RHVxa0xiVmZGckFRRkpDLXFmcE5iN3c2MHJUTzRRNW01ZEhLbHdBN1RTdkhoOXhSbmJpTWI0cHA0N2U4WlFXYVh2OWh4Q1NVeVE2R29nT3cySkh1b3ZKZWc</guid></item><item><title>Eleanor Maguire, Neuroscientist Who Studied the Brains of London Cabdrivers, Dies at 54 - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1CNGpFUW00d3JvNmMwZzRJTjBQempLMXh4M0hLaVhsZ3BrRnZPR2RWQjEyQ1hyMndTNXp1MU9Pd01TbmdCaWh3LVh1SjBxVF9ZcW0yMGNVT3JEMEdnc2JkVnp3MlA4N1li?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1CNGpFUW00d3JvNmMwZzRJTjBQempLMXh4M0hLaVhsZ3BrRnZPR2RWQjEyQ1hyMndTNXp1MU9Pd01TbmdCaWh3LVh1SjBxVF9ZcW0yMGNVT3JEMEdnc2JkVnp3MlA4N1li</guid></item><item><title>CDC shares clinical and sequencing details from 3 recent human H5N1 cases - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPby03R2pDYkZUeVJ1T212SGctUVZCbXpYV3VTM05vVzdkcFlGYml6c0FBd2d0SjZnQ2NZUWg3T0hOdXdnWmJpcVlzek5FS0VYNGhRQ3dubVNHRGdjejltTEM2dld2U0U3cUZPWDdMSmMwUXk2U3FMRXRJUjB6TC1heUpKUjR2VWRUWWlnZC1hTzlGTnUwdEduQjI4dno1cmY3bVlTLWNIUVBBTUoyNHN4bzdtRXNDU0w3VndSZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) today announced a new round of funding targeting therapeutics for gram-negative bacterial infections and rapid diagnostics for typhoid fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards for gram-negative therapeutics will be restricted to direct-acting small-molecule therapeutics that demonstrate activity against both susceptible and multidrug-resistant organisms, with a preference for products with both intravenous and oral step-down options. New antibiotics for gram-negative pathogens, which are a leading cause of deaths from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), have been a focus for CARB-X since its inception in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For typhoid fever diagnostics, CARB-X is interested in affordable, easy-to-use tests for diagnosing acute infections caused by &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt; serovar Typhi in low-resource settings. An estimated 11 million to 21 million cases of typhoid fever occur each year, primarily among people in low- and middle-income countries in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New antibiotics needed for gram-negative pathogens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Although progress has been made in the discovery and early development of therapeutics addressing various AMR challenges, there is broad agreement that we still need a new antibiotic, particularly an orally available one, with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens," Erin Duffy, PhD, CARB-X's chief of research and development, said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://carb-x.org/carb-x-news/carb-x-launches-2025-funding-round-targeting-global-infectious-disease-threats/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. "At the same time, fast, affordable, and accessible diagnostics for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;S. typhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are essential to improve early detection and treatment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CARB-X says applicants from around the world, particularly countries in which the AMR burden is high, are encouraged to apply. Proposals can be submitted from April 16 through April 30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since 2016, CARB-X has supported 113 early-stage projects designed to prevent, treat, and diagnose antibiotic-resistant infections. Of those projects, 19 have advanced into or completed clinical trials, 12 remain active in clinical development, and 2 products have reached the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Lung perfusion, or how blood flows in and out of the lungs, can thus be hard to detect in pediatric patients.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging without contrasts or radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of radiation exposure and the necessity for intravenous contrast agent, CT [computed tomography] is not used as a standard diagnostic tool in children suspected of having PCC," the authors wrote. "Instead, pulmonary function tests and echocardiography, along with a comprehensive review of medical history, are performed to rule out pulmonary and cardiac differential diagnoses. However, these examinations frequently show normal lung and cardiac function in symptomatic patients, complicating the diagnostic process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PREFUL MRI, however, is a contrast agent–free and radiation-free imaging modality that may be more suitable for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, 54 participants (27 with long COVID and 27 without) underwent PREFUL from April 2022 to April 2023. The imaging assessed regional ventilation (oxygen flow), flow-volume loop correlation metric (FVL-CM), quantified perfusion (blood flow), ventilation and perfusion defect percentages, and ventilation-perfusion ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median age of participants was 15 years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung injuries linked to chronic fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PREFUL results showed that kids with long COVID had lung injuries that correlated to specific long-COVID symptoms and overall loss of blood flow in the lungs. In participants with long COVID, greater lung perfusion correlated with increased chronic fatigue severity. In addition, higher ventilation-perfusion mismatch correlated with increased heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research provides the first comprehensive evidence of measurable regional lung perfusion abnormalities in pediatric post-COVID-19 condition using radiation-free, contrast-free lung imaging," said Gesa H. Pöhler, MD, &lt;u&gt;a senior physician&lt;/u&gt; at the Hannover Medical School in Germany and first author of the study, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074080"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Radiological Society of North America, which publishes the journal.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said PREFUL could also be used on long-COVID patients to determine how or if they are improving.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quantitative lung MRI establishes a potential imaging biomarker profiling and helps to enable disease severity follow-up for this complex condition in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quantitative lung MRI establishes a potential imaging biomarker profiling and helps to enable disease severity follow-up for this complex condition in the future," Pöhler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded, "Further investigations should prioritize multicenter longitudinal studies with larger cohorts to validate these findings and evaluate the progression of lung abnormalities at various stages after COVID-19 infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So far in 2025, no wildlife cases have been reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there have been no human cases reported, the county says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can spread to people if it gets in someone's eyes, nose or mouth or if it's inhaled; however, the county says that's a rare occurrence, emphasizing that the risk to people is still low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bird Flu has been devastating for wildlife populations around the globe, poultry and dairy cattle in our country and has infrequently affected people and cats,” said Dr. Seema Shah, medical director of San Diego County's Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch. “The County is actively monitoring wild birds and expanding testing, along with keeping tabs on people exposed to those animals in case they exhibit symptoms. We are also working with veterinarians, healthcare providers, farmers and wildlife groups to provide guidance and resources.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county recommends taking the following precautions to lower your risk of contracting the bird flu:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-warns-against-raw-milk-products-amid-bird-flu-risk/" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;consuming raw milk&lt;/a&gt; or dairy products or feeding them to your pets because raw milk is not pasteurized. Pasteurization is a heating process that kills harmful pathogens like bird flu or bacteria like salmonella, toxin producing E. coli. and listeria &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid feeding raw pet food products to pets and talk to your pet’s veterinarian about safe and healthy diets &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water when handling raw foods like meats and poultry and cook them to recommended temperature before serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching sick or dead birds or animals and report them to animal control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t let your pets eat or touch sick or dead bird or animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your cats indoors and supervise pets outdoors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get the seasonal flu vaccine. While it does not protect against bird flu, it can protect you from getting both the seasonal flu and bird flu at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reported cases of house cats dying from bird flu after consuming raw milk or food products happened in Santa Barbara County, San Mateo, Los Angeles, Washington and Oregon, the county said. &lt;br&gt;The following symptoms are signs of bird flu in cats:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurological issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of coordination, tremors, seizures or blindness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discharge from eyes &amp;amp; nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Respiratory issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing fast, sneezing or coughing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your pet is sick and you inform your veterinarian, be sure to let them know if it has eaten a raw food diet, interacted with poultry or dairy cattle or if it hunts wild birds or other wild animals. &lt;br&gt;The county says farmworkers, people with backyard flocks, wildlife workers and those who work with animals are the people most at risk for bird flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need more information about bird flu, follow this &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/avianinfluenza.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;link to the county website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s not clear when or where this second death cited by Kennedy occurred or whether there was a second death at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for his office told HuffPost in an email that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “is aware of the death of one child in Texas from measles.” They did not comment on or explain the second death cited by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death announced Wednesday is the first attributed to measles in the U.S. since 2015, the CDC, which did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Associated Press" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services has &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="reported 124 cases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;reported 124 cases&lt;/a&gt; as of Tuesday, making it the largest outbreak the state has seen in nearly 30 years, state health officials have said.

But could it also affect how their DNA functions, and accelerate the aging process itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study,&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, suggests it could. The analysis of over 3,600 older adults in the United States found that those living in neighborhoods prone to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/10/well/live/heat-body-dehydration-health.html" title=""&gt;extreme heat&lt;/a&gt; — classified as 90 degrees or above — showed more accelerated aging at a molecular level compared with those in areas less prone to extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings suggest that heat waves and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/09/climate/2024-heat-record-climate-goal.html" title=""&gt;rising temperatures&lt;/a&gt; from climate change could be chemically modifying people’s DNA and speeding up their biological aging. The study authors estimated that a person living in an area that reached 90 degrees or above for 140 days or more in a year could age up to 14 months faster than someone in an area with fewer than 10 extreme heat days a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed three biomarker aging estimates, known as epigenetic clocks, which were derived from blood samples of people age 56 and older as part of a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/resource/health-and-retirement-study-hrs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;separate national population study&lt;/a&gt;. They then looked at these age estimates alongside six years of daily climate data, comparing them across geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Epigenetic clocks measure biological changes that could predict the future risk of disease or death associated with older age. They estimate “how well the body is functioning at the molecular and the cellular level,” said Eun Young Choi, a postdoctoral associate at the U.S.C.

While DNA is fixed at birth, external factors like stress or pollution can trigger molecular changes that turn genes on and off and affect how they operate. “DNA is like a blueprint,” Dr. Choi said, but these &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/well/live/aging-biology-dna.html" title=""&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; are like the “switchboard that controls which part of the blueprint gets activated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This is the first population-level analysis to establish a connection between heat exposure and epigenetic aging in humans, building on separate research finding similar changes in &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978736/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33037634/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4769883/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;guinea pigs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Her psychiatrist seems to be trying various medications, some of which require careful monitoring and are risky for women of childbearing age. My grandchild is not responsible about taking meds properly, getting lab work done or using birth control. I know her doctor can’t discuss her case with me, but would it be wrong for me to voice my concerns, given the potential risks? &lt;/em&gt;— Name Withheld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;From the Ethicist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In general, a psychiatrist will know if patients aren’t keeping on top of their blood work and other safety requirements — the lab results will typically be sent to their office. Still, nothing stops you from sharing your concerns with the doctor. Just keep in mind that a responsible psychiatrist may feel that patients have the right to know about communications regarding their care. If she later learned you contacted the doctor without her knowledge, after all, she could feel that a paternalistic alliance was formed behind her back. So assume that your message may be shared with her. Your right to voice concerns doesn’t come with a right to confidentiality — and what feels like protection to you may feel like betrayal to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-2upsz0 eoo0vm40" id="link-66bb32fb"&gt;A Bonus Question&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;My 12-year-old son, a seventh grader, was found watching pornography on his iPad. When investigating where he got the link to this site from, we found it had been sent by a friend in their chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;While we now have implemented parental controls and had a conversation about this with our son, we don’t know if we should inform the parents of this other child about what’s happened. We saw that the link came through their chat, but we can’t tell for sure whether his friend saw it, too, or just forwarded it. We have no idea what the parents know, or how we would even approach the topic with them, or how well it would go over with them if we did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;The easiest thing would be to forget about the whole situation and move on. But we feel that may be morally regrettable. &lt;/em&gt;— Name Withheld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;From the Ethicist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents are always measuring their children’s progress to make sure they aren’t lagging behind. As you remind us, though, there are areas where their lagging behind would suit us just fine. What’s unusual about the situation you describe, I’m afraid, is just that your son was caught. To judge from several studies, he’s at the age when American youth, on average, first view pornography. In her 2021 book ‘‘Pornography and Public Health,’’ Emily F. Rothman, a public-health expert at Boston University, notes that an interest in sexual imagery at that age makes sense, developmentally speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-880428" data-gramm="false"&gt;Burton Caldwell poses for a selfie with another of his many donor-kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He'd used his own sperm to inseminate Victoria's mother, Maralee, allegedly without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria immediately confronted her mother, who she soon realized had not been fully transparent about the treatment she had undergone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fertility medicine was making great strides in the 70s and early 80s, and ethical standards and practices had not yet matured. It was not uncommon then for clinicians to use their own sperm, or samples from medical students and interns, as fresh specimens were preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, samples were also mixed up, and the male donor's identity was a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maralee and other hopeful moms were told not to ask too many questions and to count any pregnancy as a blessing, says Victoria who, after several heart-wrenching talks with her mother, acknowledges that Maralee 'did the best she could with the information that she had at that time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the bombshells kept dropping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria learned that many families in the same area had used Caldwell, whose clinic was in nearby New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria ultimately discovered that she had gone to school with at least four of her siblings without knowing about it at the time – her high school sweetheart being among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It transpired that her ex-boyfriend's mom had also been treated at Caldwell's clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He did 23andMe and then, within a few more weeks, he sent me the [message] that said: "You are my sister".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The revelation was tough to navigate. Victoria and her former boyfriend had been 'inseparable' friends for years before enjoying an 'unconditional love' when they dated for about a year, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We now have to figure out how to turn that love into a sibling sort of love; we're both struggling with it,' she admits, adding that she still grapples with the 'attraction that pulls us together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It makes sense why we were so incredibly comfortable together and unconditional with each other, especially at a high school age,' she says. 'I thought it was rare, but now I understand it's because we share 24 percent of our DNA.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-619141" data-gramm="false"&gt;The shocking message Victoria Hill received from her high school boyfriend after he received his DNA test results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-686452" data-gramm="false"&gt;Victoria now worries about what will happen to her own kids when they grow up and start dating, with so many first cousins in the community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria also struggles to manage her feelings toward her true biological dad, revealing that she felt compelled to knock on Caldwell's door at his Connecticut home seeking answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What she discovered was an old and infirm man but one who appears to have no regrets about fathering so many children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He simply explained that was the role of a fertility doctor back then, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think he's a narcissist,' she says. 'I spend my career psychoanalyzing people, and I can't do it for him.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell had little interest in striking up a relationship with his new-found 'daughter', Victoria says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm grateful I'm alive. I love my blue eyes, my intelligence, my athleticism, and that's from him, because he thought he was this elite person,' she says. 'But, I also don't think that I should be a product of fraud, and my mother shouldn't have been subjected to medical abuse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria's mother, Maralee, is among four patients who are suing Caldwell in two separate lawsuits, alleging that he used his own sperm to inseminate patients without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's variously accused in the lawsuits of misconduct, inflicting emotional distress, assault and battery, failure to obtain informed consent, fraud, fraudulent concealment and other torts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January, state Superior Court Judge Robin Wilson ordered Yale to participate in discovery in the lawsuits by providing documents related to Caldwell from 1974 to 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale entities named in the ruling include Yale New Haven Hospital, Yale University, also known as Yale School of Medicine, and Yale New Haven Health Services Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell, his lawyer, and Yale did not answer the Mail's requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Yale New Haven Health spokesperson said 'there is no evidence' of its 'involvement in the conduct alleged against Dr. Caldwell.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-643051" data-gramm="false"&gt;The mom-of-two is a clinical social worker from southern Connecticut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-850053" data-gramm="false"&gt;Victoria says lawmakers and the courts need to get tougher on dodgy doctors who commit 'fertility fraud'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-717189" data-gramm="false"&gt;Yale School of Medicine (pictured) has been ordered to hand over documents about any work with Dr Caldwell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such cases have become more common thanks to at-home DNA testing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in five Americans have taken a mail-in DNA test, recent YouGov polling shows. A quarter of them said the test results uncovered close relatives they previously didn't know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria is now part of a groundswell of donor-conceived Americans seeking to expose what they say are shifty practices in the fertility industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a dozen states have passed laws to tighten the rules on fertility clinics in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Victoria and others say the legal landscape is still patchy, and the chances of winning civil suits against Caldwell and other practitioners are slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's crazy to me that it's so unregulated,' Victoria says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say that at least 80 doctors across the US has been caught or accused of secretly using their own sperm to impregnate patients. Among the most famous is Donald Cline, a former Indiana fertility doctor who provided sperm to father at least 94 donor children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria says she doubts Connecticut will bolster its fertility clinic laws or that Caldwell will face justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, she worries about what will happen when her two young children start dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We will be DNA testing people that they want to be serious with, because my kids have over 40 first cousins in this area,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, as Nickel noted: “These tests carry the potential for healthy people to receive unnecessary diagnoses, which could lead to unnecessary medical treatments or impact mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said she was struck by the “really personal narratives” being used: “Fearmongering that if you don’t do this test, you’re not taking care of your own health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For example, despite the science of the gut microbiome test being in its very early stages, an Instagram account with over 65,000 followers promoted the test to its followers, telling them: “You DESERVE to be healthy. It is your BIRTHRIGHT. These tests will let us know with CERTAINTY what is causing your specific health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Researchers involved in the study found the overwhelming majority of posts (87.1%) mentioned benefits of the tests, with harms mentioned by less than 15% of posts, and only 6% mentioned overdiagnosis or overuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A promotional tone was used in 83.8% of posts – more than half (50.7%) encouraged viewers to take action and get the test, and 68% of account holders had financial interests involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Posts from doctors were more likely to mention harms and less likely to have an overall promotional tone but Nickel said in some cases they were also “really strongly promoting the test”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One medical doctor with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more than 65,000 followers on TikTok promoted the multi-cancer early detection test to their followers, telling them: “As you get older the chance of cancer is pretty high, if you do this test yearly then you’ll pretty much catch cancer early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;We should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/01/expert-says-overdiagnosis-means-australian-cancer-screening-tests-must-be-handled-very-carefully" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harms of cancer overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; were most clear, Nickel said, with both the full-body MRI and multi-cancer early detection test promoted as a way to identify early forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Overdiagnosis refers to the diagnosis of very early forms of disease that are unlikely to cause any symptoms or problems but knowledge of which can do more harm than good, leading to psychological stress and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/09/overdiagnosis-some-breast-cancer-treatments-may-have-been-unnecessary-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unnecessary treatments including major surgery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition to concerns about overdiagnosis, there were the financial costs of the tests themselves (full-body MRIs cost upwards of $800 in Australia) and of costly interventions pursued as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Despite egg-timer tests being &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dont-believe-the-hype-egg-timer-tests-cant-reliably-predict-your-chance-of-conceiving-or-menopause-timing-207008" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unable to reliably predict a woman’s chance of conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, Nickel said there were concerns women who received low results may experience unnecessary anxiety, and go down the path of elective egg freezing or IVF interventions when they may not have been needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said the test “preys on the insecurity” of women regarding their future capacity to conceive, noting it was often promoted to younger women who might be years away from the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A medical doctor with more than 70,000 TikTok followers promoted the test: “Whether you’re in your teens or 30s, empowering yourself with fertility knowledge is extremely important. For women, age is not a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The testosterone test was most closely linked to promotion of treatments or supplements, and often carried “really clear narratives around masculinity”, Nickel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A TikTok account with close to 100,000 followers promoted the testosterone test by telling followers: “Watch out for this scary sign of low testosterone levels … You should be waking up in the morning with a boner. If you’re not waking up in the morning with a boner there’s a large possibility you have a low testosterone level. Get it checked!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said there were also potential dangers for men taking some testosterone supplements because of a lack of long-term evidence around safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She said the problem overall was that because these tests were often sold direct to consumers, they “take the middle man – the doctor – out of the equation” and the space for a person to discuss with a medical professional whether they need the test or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Stacy Carter, the director of the Australian Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Engagement, Evidence and Values at the University of Wollongong, said the study used robust methods and “shows clearly that influential social media posts promote testing and talk up the alleged benefits of testing – even when tests are useless, or potentially harmful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study adds to the evidence that medical misinformation is common on social media, and suggests we should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested,” Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said stronger regulation was needed so that the onus was not on individuals to see through the misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOTjMwZmRpYmZLS3ZLd19fWEFVQWdEM1l4d1NqVjhBcGZnTmQzUDZWdTBYSWFRTUVYT0duWlVGZGNrUndJMGJrOGRIY3ZBY3QzOGZFMF9xRGdZQ3pnVEE1ZU9lZl9PeDZlZ3prR1cxY1V0MjZ3X0o4RGdOdlhCbHQ1b0lRQmxiVmtxdGxHRWtYdHAyZVlQcmY1TWJNUkhrYVM2ZGJwU29ROXQ3dnZVLWduUWNyZ2pLalZKcHRJT1dNNnpuYWZkS1dzTDVSUjgtbXI2RGZXUHc5eVZRVmhCNmc1cHZB</guid></item></channel></rss>
