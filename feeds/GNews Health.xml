For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: "A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said there was still "room for doubt and for clarification from further research".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was "urgently needed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Food and Drink Federation says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines," says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the Food and Drink Federation, which represents industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Current UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:53:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9tbmQ2bngtODhXdmdMWm03Rmk3QWI3NXJUMlVhUjF4ZVEtdnE2WUpOWklTUVd4RmE2RHhTRnlkbnBEWG9kazhiZmg2ZFNlRy1KbWRIamNvRUxZUdIBX0FVX3lxTE42dWdXSU8ycEFsd0RkQ0RfQjZvc0FCU1RteEJqSktTYlYtLUYwZ3dCRjhHdWFvamd1eVFnOFhqM1I2Z0NLUFV3aEx1RWZBa1BBaEVobXdiNkZHdkhreFZ3</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州现在是全国幼儿园麻疹疫苗接种率最低的地区之一--《星报》</title><link>https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-now-has-one-of-the-nations-lowest-kindergarten-measles-vaccination-rates/601471694</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt; &lt;p data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;Vercel Security Checkpoint&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="hide-mobile" data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;|&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-astro-cid-nbv56vs3&gt;sfo1::1763562901-TMw3WpD2l452rQTSIPJ4ZSvuv3Ylxfec&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNMnd3cFpOUVJLOW1aZ3podXZSQXFkWVFBVHdDYjBBRGJ5SmZOeFpQZnliaFd1dk43OGRTaVVNcDk3UVlLeG0zVFk4MG0ySWhsLUtMUWQxZ2xyXzU2T0V4LXJXcnAwbTRoWGZIRUhOLUFOejhLSlZyYzM5WjJXMC1fdTBUZTEzbEs2VVBhU2docjdIXzJPaHJuYlY2WWkzT25FZ3dPLUJyaU5oeldlc2dyakJYYks2YlhtYmRGYQ</guid></item><item><title>三种呼吸道病毒正在将人们送往新泽西州的医院- NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/11/a-trio-of-respiratory-viruses-is-sending-people-to-the-hospital-in-nj.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5ZU3O4PPNBDWVAPFJL53CMXHZQ"&gt;It’s that time of year again when New Jersey hospitals are seeing an increase in admissions associated with COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CJWBJTJFH5D7FFC7Q7DKFXRSHU"&gt;Since the week ending Oct. 25, hospitalizations associated with these respiratory viruses have increased, according to the state’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/respiratory-viruses/data-and-reports/#surveillance-reports" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nj.gov/health/respiratory-viruses/data-and-reports/#surveillance-reports"&gt;respiratory illness surveillance report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SSFMTSQ2ERABXPAIK7DHELBBCU"&gt;The majority of hospitalizations with influenza and COVID have been reported in ages 65 and older, while the majority of admissions with RSV have been reported in children 0-4 years old and adults 65 years and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="D562MU2FR5FY3DY3JTCOS3FOGQ"&gt;Despite the increase, cases are nowhere near the peak they reached last season when the &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/01/youre-not-imagining-it-the-quad-demic-is-making-everyone-sick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/01/youre-not-imagining-it-the-quad-demic-is-making-everyone-sick.html"&gt;“quad-demic”&lt;/a&gt; was in full swing and overall respiratory illness activity in New Jersey was very high.

                Doctors note that getting the flu shot is a good way to be prepared for what's feared could be a rough season for the illness.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. may be entering another rough winter for flu, according to early data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The signs are, it could be a big season," says &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/labs/webby-lab/webby-lab-team.html" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Webby&lt;/a&gt;, who studies the flu at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. "The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first clue to what may be in store is what influenza did during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere," Webby says. "It actually lasted for a longer period of time — the tail of the season went on for longer than typical."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the United Kingdom, are being hit hard. That often foreshadows what's in store for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another clue is the Northern Hemisphere's dominant flu strain so far. It's an H3N2 flu virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; flu tracker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And H3N2 viruses "tend to be a little bit more problematic," Webby says. "When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The last major flu season dominated by H3N2 was 2016-2017.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, a new H3N2 variant recently evolved and has become the dominant strain in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3525/caitlin-m-rivers" target="_blank"&gt;Caitlin Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. "And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And she says the flu shot this year "may not be as good a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That said, data from the U.K. indicates the vaccines still make a difference, Rivers says. In the U.K., the vaccines appear to be about 70% to 75% protective against hospitalization in children and about 30% to 40% protective against hospitalization in adults.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Definitely get it as soon as possible. Because activity is low right now. But it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season," Rivers says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And people don't want to catch or spread the flu over Thanksgiving. The flu kills between roughly 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. every winter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I do have concerns that uptake of both the influenza and the annual COVID vaccine won't be as high this year as it had been in previous years," Rivers said. She is concerned by rhetoric coming from federal health officials questioning "whether vaccines are safe and effective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that they are," she says. "And they are important for protecting against severe illness. So it's really important that people go out and get them this year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a written statement to NPR, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said: "It is too early to know what viruses will spread this season, in what proportion, and how well the vaccine will work in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The statement added: "The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Individuals should speak to their healthcare provider on the risks and benefits of a vaccine."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t need to wait to get information back and classify you as drug sensitive, this or that regimen. There is no need to go through all of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Access to swift diagnostic tests for TB is patchy and it can take days or weeks in some places for doctors to get laboratories to identify the TB type a patient has before they can be helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr William Brumskine, clinical research site leader at the Aurum Institute in Rustenburg, South &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, said he hoped overall care would be improved. “The hope of having a universal regimen that is shorter, that has less side-effects, is you will have less individuals coming in for clinic visits [and so] the health care providers will have more time to give individual care to patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2692e17f-4fc2-463e-8bbc-8152b2e93a56" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Phase-2 trials of a sorfequiline-based regimen at the University of Cape Town Lung Institute.

The current gold-standard treatment, introduced in 2019, successfully treats 90% of people within six months. Researchers hope using sorfequiline could improve things further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beaumont said excitement had built before the full trial results arrived. “It’s incredible when you start getting these little anecdotes from the sites [such as]: ‘This patient got cured so fast.

    &lt;p&gt;Rates of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/messages/pandemic-center-tracking-report-12770578?e=87eb75ed9e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;are surging&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, and other states and localities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whooping-cough-deaths-us-most-since-2017/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials. Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pertussis cases increase in a cyclical fashion driven by waning immunity, but the size of the outbreak and the potential for severe outcomes in children who cannot be vaccinated can be mitigated by high coverage and good communication to folks at risk," said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program, who resigned in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the first pertussis vaccine became available in the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/whooping-cough" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt;, whooping cough was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;one of the most common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; childhood diseases and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-16-pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;major cause of childhood death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. Today, children get a series of DTaP shots (full-dose version) starting at 2 months old, and teens and adults receive a Tdap booster (lower-dose version) every 10 years. (Both vaccines target diphtheria and tetanus in addition to pertussis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;8 in 10 toddlers&lt;/a&gt; had received four doses of the DTaP vaccine by age 2, and case rates were controlled. But vaccine coverage has declined since the COVID pandemic and increases in state nonmedical exemptions have widened immunity gaps, which is when the proportion of individuals who are immune falls below the level needed to contain spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas logged &lt;a href="https://www.tarrantcountytx.gov/content/dam/main/public-health/han-documents/TCPH_pertussis_HAN_05_25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1,928 pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. By October 2025, the state had &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;exceeded 3,500&lt;/a&gt;. National numbers are just as stark: In the first three months of 2025, the U.S. tallied &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r704" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;6,600 cases&lt;/a&gt; — four times last year's pace and 25 times 2023's. Several states are posting their highest case totals in a decade, and outbreaks from Louisiana to South Dakota to Idaho make clear this surge isn't regional. It's everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key factors behind these numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas lawmakers recently passed a law that &lt;a href="https://www.texaspolicyresearch.com/bills/89th-legislature-hb-1586/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;made it easier&lt;/a&gt; for parents to claim nonmedical exemptions from school vaccine requirements by allowing them to download exemption forms online. These forms now go straight to schools, not health departments, making the exemptions harder to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Dr. Phil Huang said the full impact of the new exemption rule is not yet known because it began this school year, but he expects it will make school-level vaccination rates fall even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's already noted a dramatic drop in vaccinations. Normally, during back-to-school season, "our whole front downstairs area is packed," he said. "We did not see that this year."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang believes fear of immigration enforcement may be keeping at least some families, especially Hispanic families, from getting vaccinated. Dallas County is about 40% Hispanic. "We think that a lot of them are deterred by the ICE activity," he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More complications: These vaccines protect against severe disease, but protection against infection fades over time, as is the case with the COVID and influenza vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. switched in the 1990s from whole-cell pertussis vaccines to "acellular" ones, which cause fewer side effects but do not last as long. Because more adults today than in the past received the acellular vaccine as children, many have lost immunity over time and may unknowingly pass the infection to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Babies face the greatest risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants under a year old. Some stop breathing during coughing fits. Many need hospital care, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; of whom develop pneumonia, and about 1% of whom die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this high risk, the CDC urges pregnant women to get a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/tdap-vaccination-during-pregnancy.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. This allows the mother's antibodies to pass to the baby before birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials once promoted "cocooning," vaccinating all family members and caregivers around the baby, but that strategy was hard to carry out in real life and is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6041a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;no longer widely recommended&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccination of pregnant women and babies at 2 months of age remains the strongest protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better testing finds more cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589663/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;PCR testing&lt;/a&gt; is also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surv-manual/php/table-of-contents/chapter-10-pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;uncovering more pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; than in the past. Many clinics now routinely use this lab-based technology to test for several respiratory infections at once, including pertussis. Ten years ago, these panels were uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC experts say this explains part of the rise in case counts. But the large number of infant hospitalizations and the size of state outbreaks show that true transmission has also increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A growing worry: antibiotic resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors normally treat pertussis with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;macrolide antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. These drugs work best early in the illness and help stop spread. Another drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is an option for some older infants and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/antibiotic-resistance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;macrolide-resistant pertussis&lt;/a&gt; has become common abroad, especially in China, and recent reports show resistance rising in Peru. In the U.S., resistant cases have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials warn that resistant strains could spread more easily through international travel. Because treatment options are limited, especially for very young infants, health workers are watching this closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang said macrolide resistance has not been seen yet in Dallas County. But he is aware of the national concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of whooping cough has no single cause. Instead, several problems are occurring at once: falling vaccine coverage, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/pregnant-april-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;about 60%&lt;/a&gt; of pregnant women receiving Tdap, waning immunity, improved testing, and early signs of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts say solutions must match the problem's complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the nation, clinicians are being told to have a higher suspicion for pertussis when they see patients, especially children or caregivers of newborns with a persistent cough or coughing fits followed by vomiting. Babies who stop breathing or turn blue need immediate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstetricians are encouraged to discuss Tdap during every pregnancy. Pediatricians and family doctors are urged to check booster status for teens and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several states have issued health advisories over the past two years, including &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/increase-pertussis-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;issued alerts&lt;/a&gt; in both 2024 and 2025 urging clinicians to stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huang said Dallas County is trying to rebuild public health outreach programs that were cut when COVID funding ended. But staffing is still limited. "There's just a lot of different things that are making it more difficult," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that Dallas County now receives immunization registry data only once a month, rather than daily, making it harder to track vaccine coverage. "We don't have that yet. … It's not real time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protecting the youngest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the holiday season approaches, experts urge families with newborns to take extra care:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure infants and children are up to date with their childhood vaccines and that everyone in the family is up to date with their vaccines for influenza, COVID, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep sick visitors away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek care quickly if an infant has a cough or pauses breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28.

The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme).

   &lt;p&gt;Could smoking pot lead people to drink less alcohol?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an elaborate and provocative experiment, scientists doled out joints and free drinks to see whether this idea — sometimes described as "California sober" — survived scientific scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new research offers some of the strongest data yet suggesting that smoking weed does, at least in the short term, curb how much people drink.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday — and are sure to raise questions about the merits of swapping one of these substances for another, especially given growing concern in the public health field about the popularity of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And the researchers are cautious about making any recommendations based on their findings at this point.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you," says &lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jmetrik" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Metrik&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the research does bring scientists closer to understanding the link between these two substances, at a time when many people are leaning on marijuana to cut back on drinking, without waiting for the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really moves the field forward by helping to resolve one of the unresolved questions in the literature," says &lt;a href="https://health.yorku.ca/health-profiles/?mid=1895430" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Wardell&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at York University. "This gives us more confidence that there's a real effect here."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98340" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Getting high for science&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the Brown study, the team took pains to replicate the real-life circumstances of getting stoned and drinking, while still maintaining a tightly-controlled study that could point toward a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;They constructed a laboratory that resembles a bar, with comfy seats and a tap, and ensured each participant had their preferred alcoholic beverage on hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink," says Metrik, who ended up spending substantial time shuttling between liquor stores looking for special vintages and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiment included three separate sessions. In one of them, participants smoked a marijuana joint with higher levels of the psychoactive compound, THC; in another they used a lower potency strain; and the last, researchers gave them a placebo with a trace amount of THC that wasn't enough to get them high.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;After toking up in a designated smoking room, each participant spent the next two hours in the "bar lab" on their own where they had the opportunity to drink up to eight mini drinks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The people who smoked the higher potency cannabis ended up drinking 27% less alcohol, and the lower potency about 19% less, compared to the placebo. People who used cannabis also delayed their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is an important signal that we're detecting," says Metrik. "It is telling us that cannabinoids could play a potential therapeutic role in alcohol use disorder."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that cannabis may reduce alcohol cravings and how much people drink. But the results have been largely inconclusive, in part because the data often come from observational studies, which are less reliable and can be muddied by other factors. Animal studies have also indicated potential biological mechanisms behind weed's effect on alcohol; however, there's a question of how much this applies to humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new study also builds on what a team of researchers in Colorado &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871625003138" target="_blank"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in a slightly different experiment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There, participants instead picked up their marijuana from a dispensary, smoked it at home and then visited a mobile lab parked nearby, where they were offered alcoholic beverages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The amount people ended up drinking dropped by about 25% when they were already stoned. Cravings also went down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These findings are all converging on a similar story," says &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/39978" target="_blank"&gt;Hollis Karoly&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz who led the study. But she points out there are still big questions about how much you can extrapolate from this new evidence. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98341" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Replacing one problem with another?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One obvious limitation is that how someone behaves when every sip they are taking is under close observation may not necessarily reflect what happens in a much looser, real-world social setting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And beyond that, Karoly says this pattern toward reduced alcohol consumption wasn't true for everyone in their study. In a minority of people, it actually led them to drink &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This really highlights the fact that individual differences matter," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another unanswered question centers on who's being studied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Brown trial met the criteria for "cannabis use disorder," and about 40% for alcohol use disorder. That could indicate their "drug of choice" was not necessarily alcohol in the first place, says &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/rajita-sinha/" target="_blank"&gt;Rajita Sinha&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For people with problem drinking, cannabis &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a potential treatment, she says. This approach, on the other hand, "may also be promoting more cannabis use and that would be problematic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once you're in the throes of daily cannabis use, it's very hard to kick that habit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those involved in this work acknowledge the tension in this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cannabis doesn't carry the same risks of extreme harm as alcohol, which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;is a leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of preventable death in the U.S and kills more than 170,000 people a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Wardell says cannabis is clearly "not a harm-free substance," either.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While research on its effect has not kept up with its surging popularity, studies have shown marijuana can impair cognition and memory, trigger a serious gastrointestinal syndrome that causes nausea and vomiting, increase the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric illness, and impact relationships and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Wardell says this latest study doesn't actually tell us whether the negative outcomes of alcohol are worse than cannabis in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We would have to choose which one for a given individual might be less harmful and make sure that it's not inadvertently just replacing one problem with another," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In her role as a clinical psychologist, Metrik at Brown has seen     some patients with severe alcoholism who successfully stopped drinking with the help of cannabis, though some have then gone on to develop issues with that drug.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In her mind, the problem right now is that many people are relying on cannabis to treat their alcohol problems, without any guidance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We see this all the time, and we don't know what to tell them. There's no clear messaging," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

became a tense, silent war zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is set in a classic off-campus housing situation, where a fitness-focused student lives with their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/friends/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; and his new girlfriend. The narrator is a creature of habit, a gym-goer who strictly tracks their macros, weighs their food, and consistently turns down junk food. This disciplined lifestyle, which had never been an issue before, was about to become a major point of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, the new roommate pulled the narrator aside for a serious talk. She revealed that she has an &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/hey-pandas-share-your-experiences-with-eating-disorders/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; and that the narrator’s strict habits were triggering her desire to relapse. She then made a series of requests: that the narrator stop weighing food in front of her and generally be “less strict” with their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrator’s response was blunt, telling her that while they hoped she was okay, she didn’t have the right to ask them to change their entire &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, and that her ED “isn’t really their problem.” This, predictably, did not go over well. The roommate called them a jerk, and the friend in the middle has chosen the path of a conscientious objector, refusing to take sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the apartment is a cold war zone. The narrator is left wondering if they are the jerk for setting a firm boundary around their own health and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/weird-thing-you-doing-lots/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;habits&lt;/a&gt;, or if they should have compromised their lifestyle to make their roommate more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="roommate-eating-disorder-food-3" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-eating-disorder-food/?image_id=roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="“Am I The Jerk For Telling My Roommate It\'s Not My Problem If I Trigger Their ED?”" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-eating-disorder-food/?media_id=roommate-eating-disorder-food-3" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9674773" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/roommate-eating-disorder-food-3.jpg" alt="Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED." title="Young woman and man arguing indoors, highlighting conflict about health nut roomie and strict diet triggering ED." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/couple-looking-desperate-frustrated-stressed-unhappy-annoyed-shouting-screaming_17361152.htm#from_element=cross_selling__photo" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;kues1 / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roommate’s request, while difficult, comes from a very real and painful place. As outlined by &lt;a href="https://equip.health/articles/understanding-eds/how-to-avoid-triggering-someone-with-an-eating-disorder" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Equip Health&lt;/a&gt;, specific behaviors like weighing food, strict dieting, and labeling foods as “good” or “bad” are common and powerful triggers for individuals with eating disorders. While the OP’s behaviour wasn’t intentionally triggering, it did push the wrong buttons in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a crucial difference between asking for reasonable accommodations and demanding control over another person’s life. According to Eating Disorder Specialist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/help-my-roommates-living-behaviors-are-triggering" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Kelly Flack&lt;/a&gt;, while the home should be a “safe place,” the person with the ED is ultimately responsible for their own recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reasonable request might be, “Could we avoid talking about weight or calories at dinner?” An unreasonable one, which is what happened here, is demanding a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/recording-snooring-roommate/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;roommate&lt;/a&gt; fundamentally change their personal diet and stop their own health practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while the narrator’s delivery was blunt, their refusal to alter their lifestyle was a necessary boundary. As experts at The Emily Program &lt;a href="https://emilyprogram.com/blog/coping-with-triggers-in-eating-disorder-recovery/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;, a key part of eating disorder recovery is learning to develop coping skills to manage triggers, as it is impossible to eliminate them from the world entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you agree that the roommate needed to learn independent coping skills, or should her demands have been met?

&lt;p&gt;More than 40 experts from around the world published their research in top medical journal The Lancet, blaming UPFs for poor diets globally and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/brazilian-study-links-ultraprocessed-foods-to-early-death/a-72376669"&gt;a rise in diseases&lt;/a&gt;, from obesity to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's about the evidence we have today about … ultra-processed foods and human health," Carlos Monteiro, a lead researcher from University of Sao Paulo, said at an online briefing on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we know right now justifies global public action."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Researchers blame food industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that UPFs currently represent more than half of all calories eaten in the United States, Australia and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/how-unhealthy-are-processed-foods/a-68276757"&gt;blamed massive corporations for changing global diets&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades by using aggressive marketing to sell products made with inferior ingredients and artificial methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight UPF manufacturers — Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Danone, Fomento Economico Mexicano, Mondelez, and Kraft Heinz — account for 42% of the sector's $1.5 trillion (€1.3 trillion) in assets in 2021, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The key driver of the global rise in UPFs is the growing economic and political power of the UPF industry, and its restructuring of food systems for profitability above all else," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry comprises UPF manufacturers at its core, but also a broader network of co-dependent actors who collectively drive the production, marketing and consumption of UPFs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Africa's processed food crisis — and its real costs" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Africa's processed food crisis — and its real costs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-73457359" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="73457359" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/69695215_605.webp" data-duration="04:51"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/Events/mp4/vdt/2025/dwvgeng250711_dwvgeng250710_tfs_food-ltr-wid_01imw_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/Events/mp4/vdt/2025/dwvgeng250711_dwvgeng250710_tfs_food-ltr-wid_01imw_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have urged countries to introduce warnings on package labels, restrict marketing and levy taxes on certain UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The politics of food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "Ultra-processed foods" has often been met with some criticism, with some scientists calling it "too simple."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disagreement on UPFs among the scientific community has spurred an intense debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge criticisms in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; series, saying more evidence is needed, but they also say the signal is already strong enough for governments to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also argued against criticism of their work on UPFs, saying efforts to "manufacture scientific doubt" on the subject were similar to tactics used by the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/tobacco/t-74329342"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; industry.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel have just discovered a way to destroy harmful 'senescent' cells that accumulate with age and ramp up the kind of tissue damage and inflammation that slowly brings life to a grinding halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"&gt;CD4 T immune cells&lt;/a&gt; transform into assassins of the damaging tissues when biological aging is detected in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new fighters, called CD4-Eomes (after the protein they produce), have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201848000"&gt;spotted before&lt;/a&gt;. However, this latest study highlights for the first time how closely they're linked to senescent cells and aging at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4-Eomes cells in modulating tissue senescence, with implications for age-related diseases and longevity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00953-8"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affectionately referred to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/zombie-cells-are-still-alive-but-can-t-function-and-they-accumulate-with-age"&gt;as zombie cells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/does-cellular-senescence-hold-secrets-healthier-aging"&gt;senescent tissues&lt;/a&gt; no longer divide into fresh new generations of cells, yet remain functional enough to churn out molecules that trigger inflammation in their local environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized units that attack senescent cells tend to be more abundant as we approach old age, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907883116"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown, prompting researchers to take a closer look at the CD4-Eomes cells to see precisely what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182096" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseTest.jpg" alt="Mouse experiment outline" class="wp-image-182096 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseTest.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseTest-600x317.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182096" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers added CD4 T cells collected from young mice to both young and old mice. (Elyahu et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the cells in mice at different ages, the researchers made two key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the switch to CD4-Eomes was triggered by the presence of senescent cells, as if the immune system detects the risk of pending inflammation and adapts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, when the mice were genetically edited to remove CD4-Eomes specializations, senescent cells became even more abundant. It's direct evidence that CD4-Eomes immune cells are keeping senescent cells in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed similar protective effects in chronic disease, specifically in a mouse model of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"&gt;liver cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;. Scarring was reduced and senescent cell levels dropped when the CD4-Eomes cells were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates how immune systems can adapt to combat aging over time, and that there are elements of an older immune system (specifically CD4-Eomes cells) that need to be considered in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-injections-hide-environmental-costs-we-may-not-want-to-pay"&gt;anti-aging research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People say that to reverse aging and 'rejuvenate', we need to reset their immune system like the immune systems of people in their 20s," &lt;a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/news-and-articles/bgu-scientists-one-step-closer-to-understanding-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurophysiologist Alon Monsonego, from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, our research shows that this might not be the case. So, one of the axioms of how to reduce aging may be incorrect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of scope for future research here, not least confirming that the same &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-bad-immune-cells-actually-secret-weapon-against-infection-b-silenced-redemption-lymphocytes"&gt;immune system processes&lt;/a&gt; are happening in humans as well as mice. The study team also wants to analyze how CD4-Eomes cell reactions might differ between people based on their genetics, their level of aging, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, boosting CD4-Eomes levels to increase senescent cell clearance could be an effective way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-aging-two-sharp-peaks"&gt;slowing biological aging&lt;/a&gt; and reducing some of the damage caused by inflammation later in life – but that's still some way off, and won't happen until scientists have a much better understanding of these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People don't need a supercharged immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/news-and-articles/bgu-scientists-one-step-closer-to-understanding-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Monsonego. "They need one that is working properly and appropriate for their stage in life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00953-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Once the clocks have gone back and darkness falls before many of us even leave work, the rhythms of winter can feel heavier — shorter days, darker evenings, and often, later dinners. But shifting &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/chrononutrition-58033"&gt;when we eat&lt;/a&gt; during the winter could make these months a little easier on our bodies and minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies operate on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137792/"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt; – internal 24-hour clocks that regulate sleep, metabolism, digestion and hormone cycles. These rhythms are naturally synchronised with light and dark, so when daylight fades earlier, our metabolism also begins to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection between metabolism and daylight may help explain why a growing body of research from the field of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17132135"&gt;chrononutrition&lt;/a&gt; suggests that when we eat may be nearly as important as what we eat. Chrononutrition examines how meal timing interacts with out internal body clock, and what affect short days might have on mood, metabolism and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-late-can-change-how-you-burn-calories-and-store-fat-depressing-study-shows"&gt;Eating Late Can Change How You Burn Calories And Store Fat, Depressing Study Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa354"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; that healthy adults who ate dinner at 10pm experienced 20% higher blood sugar peaks and burned 10% less fat compared to those who ate dinner at 6pm. This was despite both groups eating identical meals and having similar bedtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broader analyses support the same trends, with a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825750"&gt;meta-analysis of 29 trials&lt;/a&gt; reporting that earlier eating windows, fewer meals and eating the bulk of one's calories earlier in the day were linked to greater weight loss and improved metabolic markers (such as better blood pressure and lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17132135"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; links consistent late-night eating – especially close to bedtime – with poorer health outcomes and a greater risk of obesity and metabolic disorders such as type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182140" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier dinners may better align with the body's natural metabolic rhythms, particularly when the last meal occurs well before the body enters its "rest" phase. This might explain why eating earlier has health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many chronobiologists conclude that aligning &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18231/j.ijnmhs.2024.019"&gt;food intake with circadian biology&lt;/a&gt; represents a promising, low-cost method of improving metabolic outcomes – especially when combined with other lifestyle factors such as physical activity and &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/safe2eat/your-nutrition-needs"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eating with intent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In winter, especially in northern latitudes, shorter days and longer nights can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/29.1.25"&gt;disrupt circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced sunlight can lower serotonin levels, contributing to low mood or &lt;a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/985"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt; (SAD). When paired with longer evenings indoors, it's common for people to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01451"&gt;snack more often or delay eating dinner&lt;/a&gt; until later at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But digestion, hormone release (including those that help with sleep and digestion) and even the amount of calories you burn throughout the day all follow circadian rhythms. When meals are pushed too close to sleep, these processes overlap in ways that can affect both metabolism and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.20463/pan.2025.0003"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; – potentially increasing risks of poor sleep and metabolic ill health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182145" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-642x361.jpg" alt="This Is What Time You Should Eat Dinner During Winter" class="wp-image-182145 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/winter-dinner.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182145" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Try not to eat dinner too close to bedtime. (Iuliia Isaieva/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While light and dark have the biggest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms"&gt;influence on circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, food intake, stress, physical activity and temperature also affect them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, should you eat dinner earlier in winter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, yes — at least a little earlier. There are three main reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first has to do with metabolic alignment. Eating when your metabolism is still active supports better &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep5030034"&gt;blood sugar control, energy use and fat burning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second has to do with digestion. Leaving a few hours between dinner and bedtime allows digestion to wind down before sleep, which may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308172"&gt;improve sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third reason has to do with supporting mood and circadian rhythms. A &lt;a href="https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/efd2.70092"&gt;consistent eating window and earlier dinner&lt;/a&gt; can help anchor daily routines – especially helpful when other time cues (such as daylight) are weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the caveat: this isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Many different factors – such as how active you are, if you have any chronic conditions and your schedule – need to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elite athlete training in the evening may need a later meal to support performance and recovery. But someone less active might benefit more from an earlier, lighter dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825750"&gt;rather than rigid rules&lt;/a&gt;, think of meal timing as a flexible tool in your nutrition toolkit. The real focus should be on eating with intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-time-of-day-you-eat-in-later-life-could-foreshadow-an-early-death"&gt;The Time of Day You Eat in Later Life Could Foreshadow an Early Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means taking into account your goals (such as whether you want to lose weight or boost athletic performance), how often you exercise, how close to bedtime you normally eat, how you feel depending on the time of day you eat dinner and what's realistic given your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're eating after 9pm most nights and waking up sluggish or find sleep less restful, experimenting with earlier meals may be worthwhile. But if you're training late or eating socially, that's fine too — focus on quality over timing, choosing lighter, balanced meals and allowing at least two to three hours before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other mealtime tips you can try during the darker months include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finishing dinner earlier, ideally between 5.30pm–7.00pm, or at least two to three hours before bedtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;front loading your calories by making breakfast and lunch more substantial while there's more daylight and your metabolism is more active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;planning around activity, so if you exercise late, have your main meal earlier and a small recovery snack afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping a consistent eating window, finishing eating by around 8pm most nights to support circadian alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reflecting and adjusting by noting how meal timing affects your energy, sleep quality and mood for a week or two then changing as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staying flexible by remembering perfection isn't required – a regular schedule and awareness of what you need is what counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter settles in, paying attention to when you eat may be just as important as what you eat. Aligning mealtimes with your body's natural rhythms can help steady energy, mood and sleep through the darker months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real key is intentionality: making choices that serve your health, not rigid rules that create stress. The healthiest rhythm is the one that harmonises with both your biology and your lifestyle.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269559/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to manage medium-level anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of anxiety like a volume knob,” Dr Warrier explains. “It can be at a low level, where it’s almost like a whisper. It can be at a medium level, where you know it’s there. Or it can be at a very high level, where it’s screaming.” For low-level &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/anxiety" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, simple techniques like deep breathing or stretching can help. “Even basic practices such as box breathing or slow exhalation can calm your nervous system. In a way, it’s telling your body that you are safe,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When anxiety rises to a medium level, manifesting as restlessness or feeling on edge, Dr Warrier recommends grounding techniques. “Connect with your body’s sensory system. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can taste, and one thing you can smell.&lt;/span&gt; This brings you back to your body and helps you calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other strategies for medium-level anxiety include a quick body scan to check in with each part of your body or taking a walk. “The rhythmic action of walking can also help calm your nervous system,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do during high-level anxiety or panic attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-level anxiety, such as during a panic attack or overwhelming stress, requires a more immediate intervention. “This is where you need a slight shock to reset your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-warns-hands-shaking-slurred-speech-are-signs-of-nervous-system-disorders-5-symptoms-you-should-not-ignore-101761714665596.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="nervous system"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, either by splashing cold water on your face or keeping an ice cube in your mouth. Cold water activates the mammalian dive reflex, which brings down your heart rate, stimulates the vagus nerve, and calms you down,” explains Dr Warrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By understanding the intensity of anxiety and using the right technique for each level, it becomes easier to regain control and calm the nervous system. As Dr Warrier notes, “Different levels of anxiety need different tools. The key is to match your response to your body’s needs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

That possibility is inching closer to reality thanks to breakthroughs in regenerative dentistry. In April this year, a team at King’s College London (KCL), in collaboration with Imperial College London, announced that they had engineered a biomaterial scaffold that allows cells to communicate and form tooth-like structures in vitro — a key step toward lab-grown human teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ana Angelova Volponi, director of regenerative dentistry at KCL, said the research could “revolutionise dental care”. The study also notes that while some animals such as sharks and elephants can grow new teeth throughout their lives, humans get only one adult set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Essential dental tips for healthier teeth and gums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, if you lose a permanent tooth — whether from decay, trauma or congenital absence — treatment typically involves implants, bridges or dentures. While effective, these rely on synthetic materials, surgical intervention, and often require long-term maintenance. The KCL researchers emphasise that a biologically grown tooth would integrate naturally into the jawbone, with nerves and ligaments intact, behaving like a real tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could reduce the long-term risks of wear, failure, or rejection that come with artificial replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Reason To Smile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough lies not in producing a fully-grown tooth yet, but in creating the right laboratory environment for tooth-forming cells to do their work. In earlier experiments, cells placed into scaffolds failed to organise properly because developmental signals arrived all at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, according to ScienceAlert, uses a hydrogel scaffold — a water-rich polymer — that releases signals gradually, mimicking the natural “matrix” in which teeth form. Within this structure, epithelial and mesenchymal cells (derived from mouse embryos for now) were able to interact and begin the early stages of tooth formation. As The Independent reports, scientists are exploring two possible pathways toward clinical use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Transplanting immature tooth-forming cells — a “tooth bud” — into the empty socket and letting it grow naturally; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Growing a full tooth in the lab, then implanting it surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each approach has trade-offs: in-mouth growth could minimise surgery, while lab-grown teeth offer greater control. It’s too early to say which will prove more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What The Advantage Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional fillings and implants come with drawbacks. Fillings can weaken surrounding tooth structures, while implants require drilling and bone anchoring — with risks of rejection, bone loss or limited lifespan. A lab-grown biological tooth, derived from the patient’s own cells, would integrate organically with bone and ligament, potentially remodeling and repairing itself like a natural tooth. Still, the technology isn’t ready for patients. Much of the work remains pre-clinical, using animal or mixed human-mouse models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest KCL study relied on mouse embryo-derived progenitor cells to test the hydrogel scaffold, not yet fully human adult cells, ScienceAlert notes. Experts also point out that engineered teeth currently lack full maturation — they don’t yet have a complete blood-vessel network, nerve supply or fully developed enamel and roots. Elsewhere, researchers in Japan are running early clinical trials of treatments that stimulate natural tooth regrowth in patients born without certain teeth — a different, but complementary, line of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Challenges ahead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several technical, clinical and ethical hurdles remain. Scientists still need to figure out how a lab-grown tooth could integrate seamlessly with nerves, blood vessels, periodontal ligaments and bone to function like a real one. To avoid rejection, each tooth ideally needs to be grown from the patient’s own cells — a process difficult to scale. And even if perfected, the path from lab to clinic involves years of trials, approvals, manufacturing protocols and cost testing before dentists can routinely offer regrown teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;A Broader Dental Vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, tooth regeneration could transform dentistry itself. The field would shift from repairing damage with synthetic materials to restoring natural biology, focusing on prevention and regeneration. Someday, “just grow a new tooth” could replace “book a filling” as a standard line in dental care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though timelines are uncertain, researchers are cautiously optimistic. Some predict that within the next decade, the technology could reach early human trials, starting with simpler, single-tooth cases before expanding to more complex restorations. Either way, the groundwork is being laid for a future where smiles can truly grow back — one cell at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxQaGZ2VzM1MDBtZWVzWVlreWVqbkZPaUdnZ2hSbE5HRlFmdjhSX19iU1BLY0d4SWtidWFkQzhJa1lMV0UtZFBWWEttSC04SlJQUWVwNEJJVVJvTHpYWGxtcGljaVQ3NFZCbTlhMGRfZFhqeVRwZWNhX3VzVXlzVVYwV1JZV3ZpalgwVUhGZmNiRWpjeUdNcnlycTlYRDBIOXg5RFpwN2ZCbTBzTFIwc25EWDZQMjhjS1RGakswVEN5UGNYS3RlRy1wRUtZekJqMEJWNGxCWFJoVXM2MlBObVo1b242b1VnNDNrbERLcXFiUEV5S0FkV1k5Sjl5Zw</guid></item><item><title>威尔逊中学周三因诺如病毒疑似爆发而关闭- ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4</title><link>https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2025/11/19/wilson-middle-school-closes-wednesday-amid-suspected-norovirus-outbreak/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WYANDOTTE, Mich.&lt;/strong&gt;

plague. The same disease that wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century has never been eradicated. It's caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is spread to animals by fleas. A handful of cases are reported in the United States each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease spread to the U.S. in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early 1900s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt; likely via an infected rodent on a steamship.

If untreated, the infection can spread to the lungs (pneumonic) or the whole body (septicemic), which is almost always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking, and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present," warned Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County acting director of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is a plague case concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The plague is &lt;a href="https://netec.org/2024/03/25/climate-change-and-infectious-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a vector-borne disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a vector-borne disease&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it is transmitted to humans via the bites of infected vectors such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. As the heat-trapping pollution produced by human activity causes global temperatures to rise, it creates the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A warmer planet means longer breeding seasons for vectors and extends their ranges.

For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evidence reviewed by 43 of the world’s leading experts suggests that diets high in UPF are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A systematic review of 104 long-term studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;conducted for the series&lt;/a&gt; found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, and early death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the Lancet series authors, Prof Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, said the findings underlined why urgent action is needed to tackle UPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body. The evidence strongly suggests that humans are not biologically adapted to consume them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He and his colleagues in Brazil came up with the Nova classification system for foods. It groups them by level of processing, ranging from one – unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables – to four: ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This category is made up of products that have been industrially manufactured, often using artificial flavours, emulsifiers and colouring. They include soft drinks and packaged snacks, and tend to be extremely palatable and high in calories but low in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also designed and marketed to displace fresh food and traditional meals, while maximising corporate profits, Monteiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critics argue UPF is an ill-defined category and existing health policies, such as those aimed at reducing sugar and salt consumption, are sufficient to deal with the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Monteiro and his co-authors acknowledged valid scientific critiques of Nova and UPF – such as lack of long-term clinical and community trials, an emerging understanding of mechanisms, and the existence of subgroups with different nutritional values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, they argued future research must not delay immediate action to tackle the scourge of UPF, which they say is justified by the current evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals,” Monteiro warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/uk-government-drops-healthy-eating-push-after-lobbying-by-ultra-processed-food-firms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extensive marketing and political lobbying&lt;/a&gt; to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The second paper in the series proposes policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing and consumption. Although some countries have brought in rules to reformulate foods and control UPF, “the global public health response is still nascent, akin to where the tobacco control movement was decades ago”, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The third paper says that global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPF. UPF is a leading cause of the “chronic disease pandemic” linked to diet, with food companies putting profit above all else, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The main barrier to protecting health is “corporate political activities, coordinated transnationally through a global network of front groups, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and research partners, to counter opposition and block regulation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Series co-author Prof Barry Popkin, from the University of North Carolina, said: “We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also proposed stronger marketing restrictions, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/22/uk-ban-on-junk-food-adverts-targeting-children-is-delayed-until-next-year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adverts aimed at children, as well as banning UPF in public places such as schools&lt;/a&gt; and hospitals and putting limits on UPF sales and shelf space in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One success story is Brazil’s national school food programme, which has eliminated most UPF and will require 90% of food to be fresh or minimally processed by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists not involved in the series broadly welcomed the review of evidence but also called for more research into UPF, cautioning that association with health harm may not mean causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQYTY2WWw2Yi00SlJfSllFS09FajVTSGpDX29pMDlQd2JCMy1pMXpiQ2J0NnFuVzZfNE5FcW81WlU3M3JtYUpaWW9ram1ub0RjNy1kNloxU1JJOG9jSy1XRXNLWGNjMURBa3l2S1BkdXRUeXVGOEZQdU4wZDVLU05OYXFqaFpkRGVKT0laUDczRmEzRWxoY0E1NzhDZW5BODQwWEd5S1JSYl90UEwwWkQ2dUlUazUzVEFXWFVvSmFPdw</guid></item><item><title>维生素D过量如何导致肾脏损伤：需要注意的6个症状-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-vitamin-d-overdose-leads-to-kidney-damage-6-symptoms-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/125418369.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and immune function by helping the body effectively absorb calcium. However, the recent surge in supplement use has amplified the risk of overdosing (hypervitaminosis D), often occurring when people take high doses without medical oversight. The primary danger lies in the resulting hypercalcaemia, excessive calcium in the blood. The kidneys are forced to filter this overload, causing calcium to deposit in their tissues, a condition known as nephrocalcinosis. This prolonged strain can severely damage the filtering units, leading to acute kidney injury or irreversible failure. Recognising the subtle warning signs is vital, as early symptoms like nausea, persistent thirst, and frequent urination signal a critical electrolyte imbalance and escalating risk to renal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vitamin D overdose affects the kidneys&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive vitamin D intake forces the kidneys to filter high amounts of calcium over prolonged periods. This can cause calcium to deposit in the kidney tissue, gradually forming kidney stones or permanent calcium deposits, a condition called nephrocalcinosis. Over time, this overload may damage the kidneys’ filtering units, resulting in acute kidney injury or, in severe cases, irreversible kidney failure. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4206014/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a case study documented in the Journal of Renal Injury Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, vitamin D intoxication (overdose) can lead to acute or chronic renal injury and can result not only from self-administration but also from dispensing or prescribing errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Chronic hypercalcemia can also affect other organs, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications and disturbances in electrolyte balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common symptoms of vitamin D overdose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea and vomiting: Excess vitamin D raises calcium levels in the blood, which can irritate the stomach and digestive tract. This often leads to persistent nausea and episodes of vomiting, which are among the earliest signs of overdose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent thirst and frequent urination: High vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), forcing the kidneys to work harder to remove it. This results in frequent urination and intense thirst as the body tries to maintain fluid balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness and fatigue: Elevated calcium levels affect muscle function, leading to general weakness and fatigue. Even routine activities may feel more exhausting, and muscles may feel sore or unusually tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion and cognitive issues: Excess vitamin D can impact the nervous system, causing symptoms like confusion, poor concentration, or disorientation. These cognitive effects may be subtle at first but can worsen if the overdose continues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower back or side pain: Pain in the lower back or sides may indicate that the kidneys are under stress. High calcium levels can cause kidney stones or impair kidney function, resulting in discomfort in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling in the legs and difficulty breathing: In severe cases, prolonged vitamin D overdose can cause kidney damage, leading to fluid retention. This may present as swelling in the legs and ankles, as well as shortness of breath due to fluid buildup, which are serious warning signs of potential kidney failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do adults need?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, most adults require only a small amount of vitamin D daily, typically ranging from 400 to 1,000 international units (IU). Regular intake above 4,000 IU can push levels into a potentially harmful range, especially when extremely high doses of 8,000–12,000 IU are taken consistently over months or years. Another common cause of overdose is the accidental daily consumption of high-dose vitamin D capsules that are intended for weekly use, such as 60,000 IU capsules. Excess vitamin D leads to the accumulation of calcium in the blood, a condition known as hypercalcaemia. This excess calcium must be filtered through the kidneys, which can strain their delicate structures and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent vitamin D overdose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overdose usually occurs when supplements are taken without proper medical guidance, when multiple products containing vitamin D are used simultaneously, or when high-dose injections are administered without regulation. To avoid complications, vitamin D should be taken only if recommended by a healthcare professional. It is important not to exceed prescribed doses, even if higher amounts seem beneficial. Individuals taking long-term supplements should also undergo periodic blood tests to monitor vitamin D and calcium levels. This helps ensure the body is receiving an adequate but safe amount, minimising the risk of kidney damage and other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is undeniably important for health, but more is not always better. Careful use under medical supervision ensures the benefits of supplementation while preventing potential harm. Proper guidance, regular monitoring, and awareness of the symptoms of overdose can protect the kidneys and other organs from the adverse effects of excessive vitamin D. By following these precautions, individuals can safely support bone strength, immunity, and overall well-being without risking long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201694" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3 in 2,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are born with auditory impairments. The good news is that popping a Viagra could come with a surprising perk beyond the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/192090" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt; highlighted a mutation in a gene called CPD, which results in a form of deafness known as sensorineural hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Chicago, the University of Miami and several institutions in Turkey uncovered that the condition could be targeted by two treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One is a common supplement, while the other is the popular erectile dysfunction drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study is exciting because we found a new gene mutation that’s linked to deafness, and more importantly, we have a therapeutic target that can actually mitigate this condition,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://neurology.uchicago.edu/faculty/rong-zhai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rong Grace Zhai&lt;/a&gt;, a neurological diseases professor at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One treatment was sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra and other&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" rel="nofollow" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt; ED medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In healthy hearing, the CPD gene instructs an enzyme to maintain levels of the amino acid arginine, which produces nitric oxide, helping send signals through the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the CPD gene pathway is disrupted, causing oxidative stress and cell death in the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear hair cells&lt;/a&gt; responsible for hearing and balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the ear loses the function of the CPD gene, the ability to detect sound waves goes too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study authors addressed this loss in two ways using fruit flies with CPD mutations: sildenafil to stimulate nitric oxide production and a separate &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/vitamin-supplements-could-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-doctor/"&gt;arginine supplement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Both treatments improved hearing loss in the flies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that CPD maintains the level of arginine in the hair cells to allow a quick signaling cascade by generating nitric oxide,” Zhai explained. “These hair cells in particular are more sensitive or vulnerable to the loss of CPD.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids and cochlear implants, though the initial study results may lead to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found a promising therapeutic avenue for these patients,” said Zhai. “It is a good example of our efforts to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for treating rare diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unsurprising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 9171 subtype “continues, unfortunately uninterrupted, across multiple jurisdictions,” David Sugerman, who leads the CDC measles response, said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, local health officials are pessimistic that they’ll be able to stamp out the virus’ spread, saying that vaccination efforts have had “limited” impact. As Ars reported previously, vaccination rates are dangerously low in two measles hotspots: northwestern Mohave County, Arizona, and the southwest health district of Utah. Vaccination rates among kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year were 78.4 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively. That’s well below the 95 percent target needed to keep the virus from spreading onward in the communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, public health officials in Arizona and Utah have reported barriers to responding to the outbreak. Around a quarter of cases don’t know how they were exposed, suggesting cases and exposures are being missed. In late October, health officials in Salt Lake County, Utah, said that a person likely infected with measles &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/"&gt;refused to cooperate&lt;/a&gt; with their investigation, leaving them unable to confirm the probable case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kimberlin, who sits on a panel of experts that analyzes measles data for the United States’ elimination status review, told the Times, “It would not surprise me in the least if there’s continued spread across these next several months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the CDC  has tallied 1,723 measles cases across 42 states. Most (87 percent) of those cases were linked to outbreaks, of which there have been 45 this year. For context, there were 16 outbreaks and a total of 285 measles cases in the US last year. This year’s measles cases mark a 33-year high.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28. He told DailyMail.com if he had not had routine bloodwork done for baseball, he may not have been diagnosed 'until it was too late'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key example researchers found pertained to two beneficial bacterial species, which survived in a test tube when exposed to the antifungal drug bifonazole. The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme). But in the gut community, they relied on other bacteria for this. The drug disrupted the supply, starving them of heme. The graph lines represent the abundance of different bacterial species as the drug concentration increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors across the US have been sounding the alarm for years about a rising number of bacterial strains that have become resistant to common antibiotics, requiring high doses of less commonly used drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drug-resistant infections have since been dubbed ‘superbugs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society's most recent investigation revealed a dramatic surge in colorectal cancer among adults under 55, with diagnoses in 45- to 49-year-olds accelerating from a one percent annual increase before 2019 to a 12 percent yearly rise through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate analysis posited that colon cancer is among the fastest-growing cancers in young adults, particularly 20 to 29-year-olds, where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;cases are surging by 2.4&lt;/a&gt; percent per year on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has already been projected to become the most common cancer in people under 50 by the year 2030.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team’s work gives other scientists a tool to predict a drug's impact on gut bacteria, opening the door to strategies that protect or rapidly rebuild a healthy microbiome after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shi said: ‘Our study pushes a shift from thinking of drugs as acting on a single microbe to thinking of them as acting on an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can understand and model the ecosystem response, we could one day choose drugs and accompanying diets or probiotics not only based on how well they treat a disease, but also on how they preserve or promote a healthy microbiome.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01243-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425012437%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study has uncovered microscopic abnormalities in the blood of long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients&lt;/strong&gt; that may help explain the condition’s lingering symptoms. These hidden structures, discovered through advanced imaging techniques, show a significant departure from typical blood composition. The findings could reshape how we understand and diagnose long COVID. And if confirmed, they might finally provide a tangible target for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Microclots And Immune Webs: Unseen Triggers Behind Lingering Illness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the hunt for what fuels &lt;strong&gt;long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;—a condition that continues to puzzle scientists years after the pandemic began—a team of international researchers has turned its attention to the blood. Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70613" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, reveal that people suffering from long COVID consistently show an unusually high presence of two little-known but potentially harmful agents: &lt;em&gt;microclots&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;neutrophil extracellular traps&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;NETs&lt;/em&gt;. These substances, although naturally occurring, appear to become harmful when they accumulate and interact in excessive or abnormal ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are not the types of blood clots you’d see in a stroke or pulmonary embolism,” explains Dr. Alain Thierry, lead author of the study and a geneticist at &lt;strong&gt;Montpellier University&lt;/strong&gt; in France. Instead, they are much smaller—microscopic in fact—yet significant enough to disrupt blood flow in tiny vessels, particularly in areas like the brain, muscles, and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used &lt;strong&gt;imaging flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy&lt;/strong&gt; on blood samples from 50 long COVID patients and 38 healthy individuals. They found that microclots were nearly 20 times more abundant in those with long COVID—and, more surprisingly, that NETs were not just floating freely, but were physically embedded within the microclots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a robust association between biomarkers indicative of thromboinflammatory activity and long COVID,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They propose that this entanglement of NETs and clots forms structures that are resistant to the body’s natural blood-clearing processes, a disruption that could directly explain symptoms such as &lt;em&gt;brain fog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;chronic pain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Journal of Medical Virology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When The Immune System Traps Itself: How The Body’s Defenses May Turn Against It&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NETs are normally part of the immune system’s frontline defense. These sticky webs of DNA and enzymes, released by white blood cells, trap invading pathogens before they can spread. In typical cases, NETs are quickly dissolved after doing their job. But in long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients,&lt;/strong&gt; researchers found that NETs lingered in large quantities, intertwining with microclots and potentially amplifying the damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of these biomarker linkages not only presents a possible novel diagnostic methodology,” the authors write, “but also novel therapeutic targets, offering prospects for future markedly improved clinical management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While both microclots and NETs had been previously observed separately in other diseases, their &lt;strong&gt;combined presence and physical interaction&lt;/strong&gt; in long COVID patients marks a striking new insight. This synergy may explain why some people develop persistent symptoms long after the infection has cleared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This finding suggests the existence of underlying physiological interactions between microclots and NETs that, when dysregulated, may become pathogenic,” says Thierry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; In other words, the body’s own immune response may be creating self-sustaining, harmful blood structures that prolong illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could also help explain why standard diagnostic tests often fail to detect long COVID—these interactions happen at a microscopic level and wouldn’t necessarily show up on conventional scans or blood work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward A Blood-Based Test? AI Models See The Invisible&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more remarkable aspects of the study was the use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/asian-militaries-and-artificial-intelligence/" data-type="post" data-id="42190"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to analyze anonymized blood samples. The AI was able to correctly identify long COVID patients with 91% accuracy based solely on the presence and patterns of microclots and NETs. This raises the possibility of developing a reliable &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic blood test&lt;/strong&gt; for a condition that has, until now, largely been diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could transform how doctors screen for and manage long COVID, and even open the door to personalized treatments aimed at breaking down these resistant structures in the blood. Clinical applications are still a long way off, but this research offers a promising roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the authors caution that more research is needed to prove causation—not just correlation—the patterns they uncovered mark a significant leap forward. If confirmed by future studies, the blood of long COVID patients may hold the key not only to diagnosis but to treatment strategies that could finally bring relief to millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

However, researchers say it takes time for the body to recover and reach the level of someone who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Tasdighi emphasized that this doesn't mean cessation doesn't have immediate effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's important that people know that when they stop smoking, their risk goes down immediately and significantly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Miao agreed, adding that the study's most important takeaway is that "it's important to quit smoking early on, and no amount of smoking is without risk and health consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's not just patients who should heed the results of this study, the authors stressed. Physicians should also consider changing the way they inquire about smoking because the number of packs someone smokes per year is not necessarily predictive of long-term health risks, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Clinicians need a more nuanced approach that incorporates other ways to identify and quantify cigarette use, like smoking status and smoking intensity," Miao said, noting that whether it's smoking one cigarette a day or one a week, no amount of smoking is safe, and quitting remains the best thing someone can do for their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;To learn more about quitting smoking, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or make an appointment with your health care provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Radhika Malhotra, MD, is an internal medicine-preventive medicine resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 19:07:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOMGhZajNuWk5yWWhsOWJwbW85eG94Q3FZcE1IaDVzY3hEQnl2d0tNWXVveEYtUmF5cGpMYjQ3b2hfTExyeTNEM1VPT2VFclE5b3ZiZ183THBZYjZ4cWRIclg0a0p2VEhRd3prZFMzS2JnWXNsNm5PTWZPSGR6SVdaWExZNEVtUGFuZ1pUM3FfWFFKUGZlRXNXWDhzLVpyNkx5QkowTVc1dnhTUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOQjBmdDZlOUstQmZJejA3VDVMZXBGcDlxWFhacFdES19Bc0lvdGR3dThKQ2ZRbVpqY3dRdi1ielM2NVlvaUd5WmZyU1ZXZzExY2twbUNwNzJuNzd1OU9yZktxamNLSVNqR1gwTHluNWRKV2VBSTdyZF9fMm1NSnI2UERTYkgyRDRGUGFYZFJnUWVLREY3STZQNnltQS1ab2hZX1J3YXlzSHBmVk5IaDhN</guid></item><item><title>随着逃避免疫系统的新变种的出现，医生们准备迎接另一个破纪录的流感季节-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15302131/record-breaking-flu-season-variant-usa-subcladek.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is gearing up for another potentially record-breaking &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-ff867f50-c48e-11f0-b7f8-33463a5fea75" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; season, with a new variant spreading globally that is cause for concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts expect the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season to equal or exceed last year's numbers, which had an estimated 47 to 82 million illnesses and 27,000 to 130,000 deaths, making it the worst in almost a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was also considered one of the most intense flu breakouts in at least 15 years, with exceptionally high rates of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and pediatric deaths, driven by a high severity of circulating strains and a lack of optimal vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A map tracking epidemic trends in the US related to flu shows cases of the virus are likely growing or currently growing in all states that report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of influenza currently make up two percent of positive lab tests of all respiratory specimens tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, visits to the doctor this week for influenza-like illness are up slightly this week to 2.1 percent of all visits, indicating early signs of rising flu activity. Children and younger adults are said to be driving much of the increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new flu variant that is currently raising concerns for its ability to partially evade the immune system and the seasonal vaccine is a variant of the existing H3N2 influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strain, which has been dubbed 'Subclade K', has spread rapidly in several countries, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-ff8bfd90-c48e-11f0-b7f8-33463a5fea75"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-ff8b8860-c48e-11f0-b7f8-33463a5fea75"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and it is expected to hit the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html"&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are designed to protect against the three main groups of flu Type A and B viruses that research indicates are most likely to spread and cause illness among people during the upcoming flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US is gearing up for yet another record-breaking flu season with a new variant spreading globally adding further cause for concern (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, the recommended US flu vaccine does not protect against Subclade K, and is only designed to block the influenza A viruses, H1N1 and H3N2, and the influenza B virus, Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, f&lt;span&gt;lu vaccination coverage in the US has been slipping steadily since the COVID‑19 pandemic, according to recent CDC data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 2023–24 season, just 55.4 percent of children (ages six months to 17 years) received a flu shot, down two percentage points from the prior year and 8.3 points below pre‑pandemic levels in 2019–20.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, only 44.9 percent of adults were vaccinated, also two points lower than in 2022–23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Subclade K is thought to have emerged at the tail end of Southern Hemisphere's flu season (which is May through October as opposed to October through May in the US) and early data from the UK and Japan suggests it is already represented in most flu samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been detected in North America, although it is unclear what proportion of samples it currently accounts for there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the recent record-breaking government shutdown and internal staffing changes, up-to-date national flu activity information from the CDC was temporarily unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government organization resumed updating its flu surveillance reports after the shutdown ended on November 12, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From November 3 to 9, the CDC reported that there&lt;span&gt; were 1,665 influenza-associated hospitalizations, which marks a five percent increase from the previous week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospitalization rate is currently one per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the peak of last year's flu season, that rate was 13.5 per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most frequently reported influenza strain is H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the nationwide level for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is low but both are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Alabama and New Hampshire, levels for respiratory illnesses are moderate, where as elsewhere across the country they are low to very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of yet, there has been no reporting from the CDC on the Subclade K strain.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Alabama and New Hampshire, levels for respiratory illnesses are moderate, where as elsewhere across the country they are low to very low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The CDC uses data from emergency department visits to model epidemic trends. This model helps reveal if the number of new respiratory infections is growing or declining in each state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Subclade K flu symptoms are similar to other flu strains, with high fever, severe body aches, and fatigue being common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main concern is its rapid spread and ability to bypass some immunity, meaning vaccinations might not offer adequate protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anecdotal reports suggest in Australia it caused more severe body aches, longer-lasting tiredness and symptoms come on more suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation from the flu can make it difficult for the lungs to transfer enough oxygen to the rest of the body, raising the risk of deadly complications, including death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu can lead to pneumonia, which can cause respiratory failure, deadly sepsis, or inflammation of the heart, brain and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also make existing chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma worse, and require hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned the reason it may spread more quickly is because it has a higher reproduction rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, the CDC and other health bodies warn that immunizations are still the best way to prevent serious illness from all strains of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone aged six months and older is advised to be up to date with the flu vaccine annually, each season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In week 45 of the influenza season (November 3 to 9) there were 1,665 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations, which marks a 5 percent increase form the previous week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A visual showing flu vaccination intent in the US among adults. Plummeting vaccination rates were cited as one of the main reasons for a rise in flu cases in the US for the 2024-2025 season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older residents in nursing homes are at heightened risk of severe illness and death from any one of the three viruses due to their weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the 2021-2022 flu season, the death rate for people 65 years and older was around 7.4 per 100,000 population, compared to 0.1 per 100,000 people among those aged 18 to 49 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plummeting vaccination rates were cited as one of the main reasons for a rise in flu cases in the US for the 2024-2025 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The flu vaccination rate for US children declined from about 64 percent five years ago to 49 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Childhood vaccinations in general have been declining, driven by online misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, health secretary Robert F.

The harmful effects were seen only in male mice, offering new clues about how microplastics may affect cardiovascular health in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="embedded-entity align-left"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Changcheng Zhou&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Our findings fit into a broader pattern seen in cardiovascular research, where males and females often respond differently,” said lead researcher &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/changchz"&gt;Changcheng Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucr.edu/"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. “Although the precise mechanism isn’t yet known, factors like sex chromosomes and hormones, particularly the protective effects of estrogen, may play a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are now found nearly everywhere: in food, water, the air, and even inside the human body. Recent human studies have detected microplastics in atherosclerotic plaques and linked higher levels to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, scientists didn’t understand whether or how microplastics directly contribute to artery damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely,” Zhou said. “Still, the best strategy is to reduce exposure by limiting plastic use in food and water containers, reducing single-use plastics, and avoiding highly-processed foods. There are currently no effective ways to remove microplastics from the body, so minimizing exposure and maintaining overall cardiovascular health — through diet, exercise, and managing risk factors — remains essential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in Environment International, Zhou and his team report their use of a well-established mouse model for studying heart disease: LDLR-deficient mice, which are prone to developing atherosclerosis. They fed both male and female mice a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, similar to a lean, healthy person’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then gave the mice a daily dose of microplastics (10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) for nine weeks at levels considered environmentally relevant and similar to what humans may encounter through contaminated food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found microplastics dramatically worsened atherosclerosis, but only in males. In male mice, microplastic exposure increased plaque buildup by 63% in the aortic root, the first section of the aorta that attaches to the heart; and 624% in the brachiocephalic artery, a blood vessel that branches off the aorta in the upper chest. In female mice, the same exposure did not significantly worsen plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found microplastics did not make the mice obese or raise their cholesterol. The mice remained lean, and their blood lipid levels did not change, meaning the increased artery damage was not due to traditional risk factors like weight gain or high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found microplastics altered key cells that line the arteries. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, a technology that helps identify which genes are expressed in each cell and at what level, the team found that microplastics disrupted the activity and proportions of several types of cells involved in atherosclerosis, especially endothelial cells — the cells that line blood vessels and regulate inflammation and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found endothelial cells were the most affected by microplastic exposure,” Zhou said. “Since endothelial cells are the first to encounter circulating microplastics, their dysfunction can initiate inflammation and plaque formation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the team’s experiments, fluorescent microplastics were found to enter plaques and localize within the endothelial layer — findings consistent with recent human studies showing microplastics in arterial lesions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding the researchers report from their experiments is that microplastics triggered harmful gene activity in both mouse and human endothelial cells. Exposure to microplastics was found to activate pro-atherogenic (plaque-promoting) genes in endothelial cells from mice and humans, suggesting a shared biological response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides some of the strongest evidence so far that microplastics may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease, not just correlate with it,” Zhou said. “The surprising sex-specific effect — harming males but not females — could help researchers uncover protective factors or mechanisms that differ between men and women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou and his team acknowledge that more research is needed to understand why males are more vulnerable. The researchers plan to perform studies to determine if similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would like to investigate how different types or sizes of microplastics affect vascular cells,” Zhou said. “We will also look into the molecular mechanisms behind endothelial dysfunction and explore how microplastics affect male and female arteries differently. As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou was joined in the study by colleagues at UCR, Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was partially supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I live with several cocker spaniels. They are smart and affectionate, but sometimes air-headed, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/com0000352"&gt;impulsive&lt;/a&gt; and extremely sensitive. It's common for friends to describe my dogs as "having  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="181952" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;" as one of my canine whirlwinds whizz past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are increasingly aware of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-its-time-to-rethink-the-notion-of-an-autism-spectrum-263243"&gt;neurodiversity&lt;/a&gt;, and diagnoses such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and ADHD (&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/adhd-adults/"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt;) are becoming more common. And scientists are starting to give their attention to the idea that some of our animal cousins may also experience the world in different ways because of diversity in how their brains function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept is new, but this research may help deepen our bonds with our pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-dogs-replacing-babies-in-countries-with-declining-birth-rates"&gt;Are Dogs Replacing Babies in Countries With Declining Birth Rates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has lived with, trained, or cared for animals will be aware of how &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-020-09776-w"&gt;individual their differences in personality&lt;/a&gt; can be. But can animals really be neurodivergent? What might this mean for how we care for, train, and manage them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dneu.22960"&gt;Neurodiversity&lt;/a&gt; is a variation in how people behave and how their brains function. This is the result of structural and chemical differences in the brain. But diagnosing animals with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/9781786393401.0167"&gt;human conditions can be problematic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals cannot directly tell us how they perceive the world, or answer typical diagnostic questions. We can only ever describe animal behavior through the lens of our own understanding, for example &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635717304321"&gt;labelling some dogs as impulsive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those dogs, however, their outward impulsivity might be normal behavior for their breed, in the same way that many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1558787815001549"&gt;cats are solitary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research indicates that a range of species, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02276-9"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.549810/full"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/14/7550"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8645879/"&gt;non-human primates&lt;/a&gt;, can show genetic and behavioral signs of neurodivergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, structural differences in genes known to be associated with hypersocial behavior &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08837"&gt;have been found in dogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938411004689"&gt;Impulsive behavior in dogs&lt;/a&gt; is also linked to low levels of the neurotransmitters &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/serotonin-vs-dopamine.html"&gt;serotonin and dopamine&lt;/a&gt;. Serotonin is important for emotional stability, while dopamine helps with focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imbalances and difficulty in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11604610/"&gt;regulating these neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; may also be associated with ADHD in people, and is often characterized by impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also raises the interesting possibility that by breeding animals to live alongside us, we selected animals with behavior similar to what is reported by neurodiverse people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181967" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181967" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DogProudlyHoldingVeryBigStock-e1763438355855.jpg" alt="Dog proudly holding Very Big Stick" class="wp-image-181967 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181967" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Other dogs are very into their stick collections too. ( Teamjackson/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Modelling animal autism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have developed &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.845155/full"&gt;animal models of autism&lt;/a&gt; to help them understand factors linked to increased risk and to be able to explore potential &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu3793#core-R45-1"&gt;therapeutic support&lt;/a&gt;. These models are developed from selectively bred, laboratory-housed animals and might not fully represent typical population diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they are still valuable in helping us understand the biological basis of neurodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some beagle dogs have a mutation in a gene called Shank3, which is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.183"&gt;linked with autism in humans&lt;/a&gt; and often characterized by difficulties in social interactions. Beagles with the Shank3 mutation also &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu3793"&gt;exhibit low desire&lt;/a&gt; to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_space"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that they have reduced cell-to-cell signaling in regions of the brain linked with attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also demonstrate less of what is known as &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30550-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419305501%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;neural coupling&lt;/a&gt; with people. Neural coupling is where the brain activity of two or more individuals aligns when interacting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It typically occurs when people are &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/abstract/S0166-2236(20)30150-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0166223620301508%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;storytelling or teaching&lt;/a&gt;, but a &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202402493"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; also found it happens when dogs and humans gaze into each other's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shank3 mutation might therefore result in impaired neural processing and signaling, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/gazing-at-your-dog-can-connect-your-brain-with-theirs-research-shows-239859"&gt;limiting spontaneous social interactions&lt;/a&gt; and bonding between dogs and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, multiple factors are involved in the development of the brain and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puppies who have had &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60546-w"&gt;limited or negative&lt;/a&gt; early experiences with people might become less social and people-oriented. It is not easy to identify if the cause of this behavior is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.01.022"&gt;biological, environmental, or a combination&lt;/a&gt; of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shank3 canine research has also provided a hint at potential supportive medical interventions for human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181952" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single dose of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-023-01574-8"&gt;the psychedelic drug LSD&lt;/a&gt; was given to dogs with the Shank3 mutation. This resulted in increased attention and enhanced neural coupling with people over five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2020705118"&gt;Mice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201682"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; also seem to show a greater inclination to social behavior after  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lsd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73096" data-postid="181952" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; administration. There are obviously legal, safety, and ethical issues associated with its use, but animal models can certainly help us understand the underlying differences in how the neurodivergent brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models might also help us diagnose human neurodivergence. Typical adult diagnostic processes involve lengthy &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1403129/full?fbp=fb.1.1743206400031.71078435847139346"&gt;discussion and review&lt;/a&gt; of how someone copes with daily life, which can be difficult as neurodivergent people often have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-patterns-of-conversation-could-help-identify-early-signs-of-autism-in-children-227499"&gt;communication difficulties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs with behavioural differences are similarly evaluated using &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209852"&gt;assessment scales&lt;/a&gt;, mostly administered by their handlers and carers. However, video analysis and machine-based learning have been trialled as a more objective way to identify dogs with ADHD-like behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this method, dogs' movements in a new environment and when exposed to a robot dog were analyzed by machine, rather than a person. Results from a 2021 study of dogs showed &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/10/2806"&gt;81 percent agreement&lt;/a&gt; between objective and more traditional diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of animal research may help make the case for &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12993-018-0143-x"&gt;minimizing subjectivity&lt;/a&gt; in human diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12993-018-0143-x"&gt;Objective measurements&lt;/a&gt; have in fact also been trialed for humans, such as &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054720972786"&gt;eye movement in ADHD assessments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Neurodiverse behaviors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral problems in cats and dogs that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1558787818302727?via%3Dihub"&gt;harm their well-being are common&lt;/a&gt;. One 2024 paper that collected owner-reported data from over 43,000 dogs in the US reported that more than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S155878782400090X"&gt;99 percent of pet dogs enrolled in the study&lt;/a&gt; presented with at least one behavioral problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182029" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cat_scratching_642.jpg" alt="cat scratching furniture" class="wp-image-182029 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cat_scratching_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cat_scratching_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182029" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Behavioral problems in pets that can harm their well-being are common. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGcEyCZcAw/"&gt;Cantemir Ghita's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, some of the reported behavioral concerns, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1558787818302727"&gt;separation-related behaviors, fear, anxiety, and obsessive behavior&lt;/a&gt;, mimic challenges associated with some forms of neurodivergence in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1558787820300356"&gt;Managing pets with such behavioural problems can be distressing&lt;/a&gt; and may even lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59837-z"&gt;rehoming or euthanasia&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps this could sometimes be avoided if owners had a better understanding of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the evidence suggests that like us, animals can experience and respond to the world differently. Some of this will be due to natural differences in personality, but it is also likely that a proportion of our pets have differences in their brain structure and chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurodivergent children benefit from an &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/too-many-neurodiverse-children-dont-have-a-full-diagnosis-heres-why-169038"&gt;appreciation of their specific and sometimes complex needs&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps we can also create enriching management and training approaches for our potentially neurodiverse animal companions.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265888/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

While most HPV infections clear on their own, there are more than 200 strains of the virus, and about 14 are known to cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The CDC &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/index.html"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; nearly all &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;sexually&lt;/a&gt; active people will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives, and about 10 per cent of men and 3.6 per cent of women are known to have it. Many people clear the virus within one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It can take decades, however, for the infection to actually cause &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the back of the throat, known as throat cancer, or oropharyngeal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Michael Douglas was &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-hpv-453877-20250807"&gt;diagnosed with throat cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, and although the actor said publicly that the stage four disease was possibly &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-causes-678858-20250807"&gt;linked to oral sex&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/film"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; star acknowledged other risk factors like being a smoker and a drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Men who have sex with other men 'have higher risk than straight men' (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are men more likely to be diagnosed with HPV cancer than women?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Around two in three new HPV-related head and neck cancer cases in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; are in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Karis Betts, a cancer epidemiologist from Cancer Research UK, told LADbible that 'it can take decades' for HPV to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;On why men often face higher rates of HPV cancers, the expert further explained: “There are studies that look at risk for different people. Straight women who have sex with men have a higher risk than women who have sex exclusively with women. And men who have sex with men have higher risk than straight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The HPV vaccine is also available up to age 40 for men who have sex with men because the risk is slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Nearly one in 96 UK females and one in 43 UK males will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer in their lifetime (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Men have higher rates of head and neck cancers than women. This kind of historically links to other risk factors as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“If you look a few decades ago, there were really high rates of smoking in men, high rates of alcohol, and they’ve consistently been higher than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Men have higher rates of head and neck cancers, particularly in the mouth and throat, and these cancers are also caused by other things that are more prevalent in men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She stressed that 'smoking and alcohol are going to be much bigger drivers of head and neck cancers than HPV'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Men are diagnosed with HPV cancer more than women (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid HPV-related throat cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;HPV spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex, touching, and sharing sex toys.

Or should you be cutting out cardio, relying solely on supersets, smashing calisthenics, attending military bootcamps, doing everything on the bosu ball, using only kettlebells, taking protein immediately after your workout, nailing creatine, eating lots and lots of beef, training at a specific heart rate, squatting with your partner on your shoulders, performing every workout without your top on, or adding a resistance band to absolutely everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of suggestions goes on. There’s a gym obsession for everyone, but none of it will get you in shape the way that focusing on the (somewhat less sexy) essentials will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's go back to basics. This is the only information you really need to tackle the perennial question: how long does it take to build muscle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we actually build muscle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of building muscle is known as &lt;em&gt;hypertrophy&lt;/em&gt;. We enter hypertrophy when we apply tension to our muscles during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This tension stimulates a cascade of biological signals in the body which leads to an increase in muscle protein synthesis, a process during which new proteins are produced and integrated into the muscle fibers, leading to larger and stronger muscles,” explains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Harry Cox&lt;/a&gt;, founder of London’s high-end &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.clubqhealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.clubqhealth.com/"}' href="https://www.clubqhealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Club Q Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we actually do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resistance training&lt;/em&gt; is a great way to build muscle in the gym. Essentially, this means moving your body with weights to make those movements harder. A bicep curl with a dumbbell is harder than it would be with no weight, for instance. This is resistance training. The heavier the weight—or greater the resistance—the more our muscles are forced to adapt, making them grow stronger over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do it right and you can build muscle by weight training as little as two to three times a week, according to fitness expert &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pennyweston.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pennyweston.com/"}' href="https://pennyweston.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Weston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should always make sure to increase your weights to push yourself and ensure you are creating as much resistance, and therefore muscle trauma, as possible,” she says, referring to a method called &lt;em&gt;progressive overload&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To progressively overload your muscles, you’ll want to go heavier on at least two out of your four sets per exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:05:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE4wUFZpbGY2d3o2QVFkYWRjVVJlRDg3WTJFZjUxOHYzVFEyVk5mZUJBZldaY3dGZzEzMUJ5LVY1d0FCM3NfcGFNQlBqdU1OU3hfckxWb1RIcENJSjQxYTd3Y3FsaHc4czdMWFdMdGhObDF3Zw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现二甲双胍可能阻碍关键的运动益处- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251117095648.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A widely used medication for diabetes prevention may unexpectedly interfere with one of the most reliable ways to lower disease risk: regular physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rutgers-led team reported in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; that metformin appeared to weaken several important benefits normally gained from exercise. These include improvements in blood vessel function, overall fitness and the body's ability to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, medical guidance has encouraged people with elevated blood sugar to combine metformin with consistent exercise. The expectation was that two well-established treatments would reinforce one another. According to the Rutgers researchers, the evidence suggests a different outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most health care providers assume one plus one equals two," said Steven Malin, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health in the School of Arts and Sciences and the lead author of the study. "The problem is that most evidence shows metformin blunts exercise benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Tested Metformin's Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this issue, Malin and his colleagues enrolled 72 adults considered at risk for metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of conditions known to raise the likelihood of both diabetes and heart disease. Participants were separated into four groups: high-intensity exercise with placebo, high-intensity exercise with metformin, low-intensity exercise with placebo and low-intensity exercise with metformin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a 16-week training period, the research team measured how well participants' blood vessels responded to insulin. This response helps vessels widen and deliver oxygen, hormones and nutrients after eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that exercise alone strengthened vascular insulin sensitivity. Blood vessels became more responsive to insulin, allowing greater blood flow to the muscles. This is important because insulin-assisted dilation helps move glucose from the bloodstream into body tissues, lowering blood sugar after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metformin Significantly Reduced Expected Gains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When metformin was added, these improvements became noticeably smaller. The medication also appeared to limit gains in aerobic capacity and lessen positive changes in inflammation and fasting blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Blood vessel function improved with exercise training, regardless of intensity," Malin said. "Metformin blunted that observation, suggesting one type of exercise intensity is not better either with the drug for blood vessel health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are concerning because exercise is intended to support healthy blood sugar levels and improve physical capability. If metformin reduces these effects, patients relying on both may not receive the degree of protection they expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you exercise and take metformin and your blood glucose does not go down, that's a problem," Malin said. "People taking metformin also didn't gain fitness. That means their physical function isn't getting better and that could have long-term health risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Life Consequences for Daily Function and Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malin noted that exercise-driven fitness improvements influence everyday activities such as climbing stairs, playing with children or maintaining an active social life. If these gains are diminished, overall quality of life can suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that the findings should not prompt anyone to stop taking metformin or abandon exercise. Instead, the study highlights the need for physicians to closely consider how these interventions interact and to monitor patient progress. Malin hopes that future studies will help identify approaches that preserve the positive effects of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Metformin May Interfere With Exercise Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason metformin dampens exercise benefits is still being investigated. Malin explained that metformin partly works by inhibiting specific mitochondrial processes. This action reduces oxidative stress and helps regulate blood sugar. However, the same interference may block the cellular changes typically triggered by exercise, including better mitochondrial efficiency and improved aerobic performance. In essence, the mechanism that makes metformin effective may also hinder the body's ability to fully respond to physical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have suggested a similar pattern, but this trial is one of the first to look closely at vascular insulin sensitivity, a key factor in both glucose control and cardiovascular health. By demonstrating that metformin can limit changes in both major arteries and small capillaries across different exercise intensities, the researchers highlight how complex these combined treatments can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Diabetes Prevention and Clinical Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malin pointed out that nearly 35 million people in the United States live with type 2 diabetes, and prevention strategies often depend on a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. If these approaches do not work together as expected, long-term risks may increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to figure out how to best recommend exercise with metformin," Malin said. "We also need to consider how other medications interact with exercise to develop better guidelines for doctors to help people lower chronic disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;

This suggests that we may be able to develop treatment or prevention strategies that are helpful for young people with a range of common disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dIewYy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The findings are significant because they suggest that mental health disorders should not be studied in isolation as they traditionally are" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-569078"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The findings are significant because they suggest that mental health disorders should not be studied in isolation as they traditionally are&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that girls and boys are more alike than previously thought, as both experienced similar changes in brain structure with the same mental health disorders. This was surprising given that previous, albeit much smaller, studies had suggested that girls and boys with the same disorder might show different changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is despite considerable evidence showing ADHD and conduct disorder is more common in boys, and depression and anxiety is more common in adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephane De Brito from the University of Birmingham, who also contributed to the study, said: “At this point in time, while we can say that the brain is involved in all four of the disorders that we studied, it seems unlikely that these changes in brain structure can explain why there are important sex differences in the prevalence of these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means we might have to look at other factors such as the child's early environment or experiences, which might interact with changes in the structure or function of the brain to increase risk for developing disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together 68 international research groups across five continents from the global alliance group of scientists at the ENIGMA Consortium, which specialises in understanding brain structure and genetic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ftgoqS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Brains with either of the four conditions tended to have a reduce surface area in regions responsible for processing emotions, responding to threats and maintaining awareness of bodily states" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-569079"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Brains with either of the four conditions tended to have a reduce surface area in regions responsible for processing emotions, responding to threats and maintaining awareness of bodily states&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (University of Bath)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalised anxiety disorder is defined as feelings of stress or worry that affect your daily life and are difficult to control.

Symptoms of ADHD, according to the NHS, usually start before the age of 12 and include being easily distracted, finding it hard to listen or follow instructions and forgetting everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct disorder is defined as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which societal norms, rules or laws are violated.

The number of affected individuals increased from 378 million in 1990 to 788 million in 2023. As populations have expanded and grown older, the condition has reached a point where it is now listed among the top 10 causes of death across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from NYU Langone Health, the University of Glasgow, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington led the investigation. Their work focused on chronic kidney disease, a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose the ability to clear waste and extra fluid from the bloodstream. Early stages often produce no noticeable symptoms, while advanced disease may require dialysis, kidney replacement therapy, or a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Burden and Mortality Trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study estimates that roughly 14% of adults worldwide live with chronic kidney disease. In addition, approximately 1.5 million people died from the condition in 2023. When changes in population age structures are taken into account, this represents more than a 6% increase in deaths since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that chronic kidney disease is common, deadly, and getting worse as a major public health issue," said study co-senior author Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. "These findings support efforts to recognize the condition alongside cancer, heart disease, and mental health concerns as a major priority for policymakers around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Health Priority for Global Agencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the World Health Organization added chronic kidney disease to its list of health priorities aimed at reducing early deaths from noncontagious diseases by one-third before 2030. Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that identifying current patterns in the disease is essential for developing effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new report was published online Nov. 7 in The Lancet and, according to the authors, represents the most detailed assessment of chronic kidney disease in nearly ten years. It is also being presented at the American Society of Nephrology's annual Kidney Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, considered the most wide-ranging effort to track health-related loss in countries over long periods of time. Findings from this initiative frequently inform public health policy and guide future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate the new estimates, the team examined 2,230 scientific papers and national health datasets from 133 countries. Their work centered not only on diagnoses and deaths, but also on the level of disability associated with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to Heart Disease and Leading Risk Factors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key conclusion was that impaired kidney function is a major contributor to heart disease. The study reports that it accounted for about 12% of global cardiovascular deaths. In 2023, chronic kidney disease ranked as the 12th leading cause of disability-related reductions in quality of life. High blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high body mass index (a measure of obesity) were identified as the most significant risk factors for developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most individuals in the study were in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. Coresh emphasizes that this is a crucial window for intervention, as timely treatment and lifestyle changes can prevent the need for dialysis or transplantation later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Treatment Remains Uneven Worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh also points out that in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and other lower-income regions, many people do not receive dialysis or transplants. These therapies are less accessible and often too expensive for widespread use in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated," said study co-lead author Morgan Grams, MD, PhD. "Our report underscores the need for more urine testing to catch it early and the need to ensure that patients can afford and access therapy once they are diagnosed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapies but Slow Global Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grams, the Susan and Morris Mark Professor of Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that several new medications introduced over the past five years can slow disease progression and reduce the likelihood of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Even so, she explains that it will take time before the benefits of these treatments are reflected worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also warns that because chronic kidney disease is often not tested for, its true global prevalence may be even higher than the study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Support and Research Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was funded by National Institutes of Health grant R01DK100446, the Gates Foundation, and the National Kidney Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh serves as a scientific adviser and equity holder in Healthy.io, a health technology company that provides remote clinical testing and related services. He also works as a consultant for SomaLogic. These roles are disclosed and managed according to NYU Langone Health policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Coresh and Grams, Patrick Mark, PhD, at the University of Glasgow, and Lauryn Stafford, MS, at IHME at the University of Washington in Seattle, were co-lead authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional co-senior authors included Jennifer Lees, PhD, at the University of Glasgow, and Theo Vos, PhD, and Liane Ong, PhD, at IHME at the University of Washington in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Aging sneaks up on everyone, but nothing prepares you for the moment you realize your parents are getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not something that happens slowly in your mind. It hits you all at once, like an emotional punch you didn’t see coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, they’re lecturing you about “real music” or fixing the kitchen sink like it’s no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next, you’re helping them figure out how to refill a prescription or turn on closed captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are eight moments that make you stop in your tracks and realize your parents aren’t invincible anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) They start repeating the same stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard the one about their first apartment more times than you can count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rent was cheap, the neighbors were weird, and they had to walk uphill both ways to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that they don’t remember telling you before. It’s that those memories have become more alive than the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past feels comfortable to them, like a well-worn sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to interrupt my dad when he started his story about his first guitar gig. Now, I just listen. Because one day, I’ll wish I could hear it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start realizing that their memories matter more than their plans, and that’s a hard truth to sit with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Their physical pace slows down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it’s barely noticeable. Maybe your mom walks a little slower at the park, or your dad takes his time getting out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, you realize they’re always a few steps behind. They rest more often, sit longer, and move with a kind of caution you never saw before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this with my mom last year when she visited California. She used to insist on walking everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, she suggested we drive to the café two blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a quiet, heartbreaking shift. The same people who once carried you up the stairs now take them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Technology starts to leave them behind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when they laughed at you for being glued to your phone? Now they struggle to find the camera app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve explained what “the cloud” is more times than you can count. And every time, it feels like starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about time. They grew up in a world that didn’t constantly update itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere between Facebook and streaming services, they reached their limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s tough to watch isn’t the confusion itself, but the &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-9-habits-people-fall-into-as-they-age-that-quietly-destroy-their-confidence/"&gt;loss of confidence&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it. The people who once taught you everything now turn to you for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Their health becomes a constant conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, dinner talk sounds like a medical briefing. They mention cholesterol, blood pressure, or that “funny pain” that won’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start recognizing the names of their medications and the days of their doctor appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time my dad called just to tell me about a new supplement he was taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not about music, not about his day, just &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-vitamin-d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. That’s when it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You realize you’ve entered a new stage of life, where “How are you doing?” really means “How’s your health holding up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) They start saying “I’m tired” more often&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just at the end of a long day. Sometimes, it’s in the middle of a sentence, or after a story, or while looking out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m just tired.” Those three words mean more than they let on. It’s not only &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-eeling-exhausted-psychology-says-these-7-common-habits-are-secretly-draining-your-energy/"&gt;physical exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s life fatigue, the kind that comes from decades of being responsible for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boomers are the generation that pushed through everything. Work, bills, parenting, social change. They didn’t rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when they finally say they’re tired, it’s like a quiet confession that they can’t keep pushing forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a moment that softens you. You start seeing their strength as something that came at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) They lose touch with what’s current&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mention a new artist, and they ask, “Who?” You show them a viral video, and they blink like you’re &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-9-refined-hobbies-that-secretly-reveal-a-high-value-personality/"&gt;speaking another language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not trying to be out of touch. They just stopped keeping up. The noise of trends, names, and updates no longer matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom once told me she didn’t recognize anyone performing at the Grammys. Not one name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the same woman who raised me on Fleetwood Mac and Joni Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That realization stings. The people who gave you your love of culture now live outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about music or memes. It’s about time pulling you in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) They start talking about the past like it’s all that matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their stories start with “Back in my day” or “When you were little” more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not nostalgia in the lighthearted sense. It’s comfort. The past feels safer than a world they no longer recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but nostalgia isn’t just reminiscing. It’s a kind of psychological anchor. It helps people &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-people-who-live-peacefully-despite-chaos-around-them-usually-display-these-9-traits/"&gt;feel grounded&lt;/a&gt; when everything around them moves too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts a little when you realize they’re living more in memory than in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re trying to make new memories with them, and they’re holding onto the old ones like lifelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) They start needing you in ways they never did before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is the hardest to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mom asks you to help her with her online banking. Your dad wants you to drive him to the doctor, “just in case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start filling out forms for them, &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-10-practical-skills-boomers-have-that-younger-people-pay-hundreds-of-dollars-to-outsource/"&gt;fixing appliances&lt;/a&gt;, and organizing paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become the one who remembers things, who plans, who takes charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift happens quietly, and suddenly you’re the adult in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt it the day my dad asked me to organize his medications. This was the same man who once built my first bike from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him confused over pill bottles broke something inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You realize the roles have reversed. The people who once held your world together now lean on you to keep theirs steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The quiet ache of realizing they’re human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these moments are loud or dramatic. They’re small changes you notice in passing. But together, they paint a picture that’s impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your boomer parents aren’t superheroes anymore. They’re human. Vulnerable. Slowing down in a world that refuses to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that realization hurts, because it reflects your own timeline too. You see where you came from, and you catch a glimpse of where you’re heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that’s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to slow down with them. To listen to those old stories again. To take the drive to the café, even if it’s only two blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because one day, you’ll wish for just one more story, one more walk, one more reminder that they were here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s Your Plant-Powered Archetype?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what your everyday habits say about your deeper purpose—and how they ripple out to impact the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 90-second quiz reveals the plant-powered role you’re here to play, and the tiny shift that makes it even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr.
Lois Anne Cook (née Simmons), age 76, passed away on November 3,
2025, in Eureka, California. Born on October 22, 1949, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lois lived a life defined by service,
compassion, and an unwavering dedication to healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
pursued her medical education at the David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA and completed her residency in pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. Her commitment to public health led her to serve as a
Fellow in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control from 1985 to 1987, where she focused on the
epidemiology of birth defects and developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her
career was marked by a deep devotion to children and families. From
June 1988 to June 1999, she served as a developmental pediatrician
and multidisciplinary team leader for the United States Department of
Defense’s Exceptional Family Member Program. In this role, she worked
tirelessly to ensure that military families with special needs
children received the support and care they deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In
June 2001, Lois founded Comprehensive Pediatric Care, P.C., where she
served as owner and pediatrician until May 2013. Her practice was not
just a place of medicine but a sanctuary of hope for countless
families. She later continued her work as a developmental
pediatrician at Open Door Clinic from June 2013 to July 2014 and then
as a pediatric hospitalist at Mad River Community Hospital beginning
in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
also gave generously of her time as a mentor with the Meritius
Foundation, helping guide and inspire future generations of
caregivers and leaders. Her professional life was a testament to her
belief that every child deserved not only medical care but also
affirmation, encouragement, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Outside
of her professional accomplishments, Lois lived with profound
spiritual depth. Her spirituality transcended any single tradition —
it was an ever-present force in how she moved through life, treated
others, and found meaning in both the ordinary and extraordinary.
Whether hiking with her beloved dogs Lulu and Muzzy or listening to
meditation books through her earbuds, she found peace and purpose in
nature and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every
day, rain or shine, she walked Lulu and Muzzy at the dog park near
her home in McKinleyville. During blackberry season, she would return
from those walks with bags full of berries she had picked along the
way — simple joys that reflected her deep connection to the world
around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
was an avid reader with an extensive library that reflected both her
intellectual curiosity and spiritual journey. She inspired countless
people to believe in themselves and pursue their dreams. Through her
example, she showed that anything is possible when guided by love,
faith, and determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
leaves behind her daughter Jennifer Paris; her sister Jeanne; and
brothers Leon, John, Mark, and Joe. She was preceded in death by her
daughter Marian Jessica Cook and brother Danny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois’s
legacy lives on in the lives of those she touched — patients who
felt truly seen and heard under her care; colleagues who were
uplifted by her wisdom; family members who were nourished by her
love; and friends who were transformed by her presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
was truly an instrument of God — relentless in her pursuit of
healing, committed wholly to service, and gifted with one of the most
compassionate hearts imaginable. She gave selflessly — never
hesitating to offer help or comfort — and never stopped searching
for answers when it came to those under her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
May
her memory bring comfort to all who knew her and continue to inspire
those who follow in her footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The obituary above was submitted on behalf of Dr. Lois Cook’s loved ones.

&lt;p&gt;Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans’ views on childhood vaccines, vaccine research and vaccine policy. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,111 adults from Oct. 20 to 26, 2025. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, presidential vote (among voters) and other factors. &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/the-american-trends-panel/"&gt;Read more about the ATP’s methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_questionnaire.pdf"&gt;questions used for this report&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_topline.pdf"&gt;topline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/childhood-vaccines-methodology/"&gt;survey methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A majority of Americans (63%) are highly confident that childhood vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness. And majorities say these vaccines protect both vaccinated children (69%) and the wider community (65%), though larger shares of Democrats than Republicans hold these views.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;By comparison, smaller shares of U.S. adults – and Republicans in particular – are extremely or very confident that childhood vaccines have gotten enough safety testing (53%) or that the vaccine schedule is safe (51%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Overwhelming majorities of both Democrats (92%) and Republicans (78%) say the benefits of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine outweigh the risks. Still, among Republicans, this share is down from 91% in 2016.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Republican support for MMR vaccine school requirements also continues to slip, from 79% in 2019 to 52% today.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say medical scientists should have a major role in childhood vaccine policy decisions. In turn, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say parents of young children should have a major role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a year that has seen &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv"&gt;evolving federal vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000"&gt;historic measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, 63% of Americans have high confidence in the effectiveness of childhood vaccines. But trust dips somewhat when it comes to their safety testing (53%) and schedule (51%). This drop-off is especially pronounced among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Pew Research Center survey asked Americans about their views on childhood vaccines, vaccine research and related policy. This study builds on the Center’s broader work tracking Americans’ attitudes about &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/science/science-issues/medicine-health/vaccines/"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/science/trust-in-science/"&gt;trust in science&lt;/a&gt;. This analysis covers findings on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/11/18/have-changes-to-cdc-guidelines-influenced-americans-covid-19-vaccine-decisions/"&gt;How have changes to CDC recommendations influenced Americans’ COVID-19 vaccine decisions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A majority of Americans (63%) are extremely or very confident that childhood vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;with Democrats and Democrat-leaners much more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaners to express a high level of confidence (80% vs. 48%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, there’s somewhat less certainty, and more &lt;em&gt;uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;, about these vaccines’ safety testing and schedule &lt;/strong&gt;– that is, the timing and number of vaccines children get. About half of Americans are extremely or very confident that childhood vaccines have been tested enough for safety (53%) or that the schedule is safe (51%). On the flip side, about one-in-five are not too or not at all confident in either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This doubt is heavily driven by Republicans, who are divided between high and low confidence in childhood vaccine safety.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, 32% of Republicans have high confidence in the vaccine schedule’s safety, and 31% have low confidence. Democrats are much more aligned: 71% have high confidence and 7% have low confidence in the schedule’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="views-by-demographic-group"&gt;Views by demographic group&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Across all three vaccine dimensions we asked about, &lt;strong&gt;older adults are somewhat more likely than younger ones to trust childhood vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, 63% of people ages 65 and older express high confidence in vaccine safety testing, compared with about half of adults under 50 (49%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race and ethnicity:&lt;/strong&gt; Asian (70%) and White (66%) adults are more likely to be highly confident childhood vaccines are effective against serious illness, compared with Black (54%) and Hispanic (58%) adults. When it comes to trust in their safety testing and schedule, Asian adults are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to be extremely or very confident.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with more education are more likely than those with less education to express trust in the effectiveness, safety and schedule of childhood vaccines. For example, two-thirds of adults with a postgraduate degree say they are highly confident in the vaccine schedule, compared with less than half of those who have a high school education or less (44%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But low confidence in vaccine safety testing and the schedule is not limited to adults with a high school degree or less.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, similar shares of Americans with a four-year college degree (19%), some college (21%) or high school degree or less (19%) are not too or not at all confident in the vaccine schedule’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents of children under age 18, &lt;/strong&gt;who are in the thick of childhood vaccine decisions, are slightly more likely than adults without minor children to have low confidence in the effectiveness, safety testing and schedule of these vaccines. For example, 24% of parents have low confidence in the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule, compared with 17% of adults who don’t have minor children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more on parents’ views on childhood vaccines, refer to this additional analysis: &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/parents-confidence-in-childhood-vaccine-effectiveness-safety-testing-and-schedule/"&gt;Parents’ confidence in childhood vaccine effectiveness, safety testing and schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. measles cases in 2025 reached their &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;highest level in more than two decades&lt;/a&gt;, with the vast majority of reported cases occurring among unvaccinated people. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has been part of routine child immunization in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/measles"&gt;since the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline"&gt;share of children receiving it&lt;/a&gt; has dipped in recent years, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;strong&gt;Americans’ positive views on the MMR vaccine have largely held since we first started asking about this in 2016.&lt;/strong&gt; A solid majority (84%) says its benefits outweigh its risks. And seven-in-ten say the vaccine’s preventative health benefits are high or very high, while just 15% say the same about the risk of side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overwhelming majorities of both Democrats (92%) and Republicans (78%) say that the MMR vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks. Yet Republicans are more likely than Democrats to rate the risk of side effects as high (20% vs. 9%) and less likely to say the preventative health benefits are high (62% vs. 80%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Republicans have grown less positive about the MMR vaccine over time. In 2016, 75% of Republicans rated its preventive health benefits of highly, compared with 62% today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/childhood-vaccines-appendix/"&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt; for views of the MMR vaccine by demographic group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 id="8c4f90b810311e0057221944ad1ff0aa" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;School MMR requirements&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine is currently required for children to enter public school &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-indicator/state-vaccine-requirements-for-children/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D"&gt;in every state&lt;/a&gt;, but school vaccine policies have been a flashpoint of debate as Florida plans to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/florida-plans-end-all-state-vaccine-mandates-including-schools-2025-09-03/"&gt;eliminate school vaccine requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, a vast majority of U.S. adults have said healthy children should be required to get the vaccine to attend public school because of the potential risks for others when children are not vaccinated. &lt;strong&gt;But support for school MMR requirements dropped from 82% in 2019 to 69% in 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This decline is largely because of a steep slide in support among Republicans. &lt;/strong&gt;In 2019, before the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, 79% of Republicans said healthy children should be required to get the MMR vaccine to attend school. This share sunk to 57% in 2023, then to 52% in 2025. In contrast, Democrats’ views on school MMR requirements have remained stable, with solid majority support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For views on school vaccine requirements by demographic group, refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/11/18/childhood-vaccines-appendix/"&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond trust in childhood vaccines, this survey also looks at Americans’ impressions of the scientists who study them. Previous Center research has found that U.S. adults &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/trust-in-science-2024-appendix/ps_2024-11-14_trust-in-science_a-02/"&gt;largely trust medical scientists&lt;/a&gt; to act in the public’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to research on childhood vaccine risks and benefits, a vast majority (87%) say medical scientists’ findings are &lt;strong&gt;influenced by the best available scientific evidence&lt;/strong&gt; either most of the time (49%) or some of the time (38%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, 85% say their research is &lt;strong&gt;influenced by concern for the best interests of children’s health &lt;/strong&gt;at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Majorities also see the interests of &lt;strong&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/strong&gt; (77%) and scientists’ own &lt;strong&gt;political leanings&lt;/strong&gt; (64%) as influential at least some of the time. Smaller shares say these factors influence childhood vaccine research &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time, compared with the role of scientific evidence and concern for children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partisans disagree about how often these factors influence medical scientists’ research:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say scientists are influenced most of the time by the best available scientific evidence (66% vs. 35%) and by the best interests of children’s health (62% vs. 34%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;But Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say scientists are influenced most of the time by the interests of pharmaceutical companies (45% vs. 22%) or by their own political leanings (29% vs. 14%).The shares of Republicans saying medical scientists are influenced this much by concern for children and the best scientific evidence have dropped since 2016 (-18 and -13 percentage points, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many groups – from scientists to parents to government and heads of industry – have a stake in childhood vaccine policy. How much influence do Americans think they should have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americans largely say medical scientists should play a major role in childhood vaccine policy.&lt;/strong&gt; Roughly three-quarters say scientists should have a major role in these decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A smaller majority (59%) see a major role for &lt;strong&gt;parents of young children &lt;/strong&gt;in vaccine policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around four-in-ten or fewer say the general public (37%), federal officials (27%), state officials (26%), pharmaceutical leaders (25%) or health insurance providers (17%) should play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About half of Americans say &lt;strong&gt;health insurance company leaders should&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; role&lt;/strong&gt; in making decisions on childhood vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 id="e751683aa4fbfc8d870d626de8251b29" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Views by party&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous Center work has found that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support scientists playing an active role in &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/ps_2024-11-14_trust-in-science_00-08/"&gt;policy debates about scientific issues&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, a much larger share of Democrats (85%) than Republicans (62%) say medical scientists should have a major role in decisions about childhood vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-420-wide"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/?attachment_id=279667"&gt;&lt;img data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" sizes="auto, (max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" src="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?w=420" alt="Chart shows Far more Republicans than Democrats say parents with young children should have a major role in policy decisions about childhood vaccines" class="wp-image-279667 not-transparent" srcset="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png 840w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=230,300 230w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=768,1000 768w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=786,1024 786w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=311,405 311w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=200,260 200w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=260,339 260w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=310,404 310w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=420,547 420w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=640,834 640w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=740,964 740w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=160,208 160w, https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/PS_2025.11.18_childhood-vaccines_0-09.png?resize=320,417 320w"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Views are reversed when it comes to the role of parents with young children. &lt;strong&gt;Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say parents of young children should have a major role &lt;/strong&gt;in policy decisions about childhood vaccines (71% vs. 46%). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are smaller partisan differences for the other groups we asked about. For example, 44% of Republicans say the general public should play a major role, compared with 30% of Democrats. And small shares in both parties say health insurance company leaders should have a major role (14% Republicans and 18% Democrats).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 id="9105dc163aa30405598727b45ce38203" class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Views by education&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults with more education are more likely to say medical scientists should have a major role in childhood vaccine policy decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; Americans with a postgraduate degree (86%) overwhelmingly hold this view, compared with a smaller majority among those who have a high school education or less (65%). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults with a high school education or less are more likely than those with at least a four-year college degree to support a major role for parents with young children (68% vs. 49%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 data-is-section="true" data-wp-context='{"id":"to-what-extent-do-childhood-vaccines-protect-children-and-communities"}' data-wp-interactive='{"namespace":"prc-block\/table-of-contents"}' class="wp-block-heading" id="to-what-extent-do-childhood-vaccines-protect-children-and-communities"&gt;To what extent do childhood vaccines protect children and communities?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines can protect a vaccinated child from serious illness, but broad vaccine coverage also protects the wider community – a concept often called “&lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/what-do-vaccines-do/how-herd-immunity-works"&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mirroring their overall confidence in childhood vaccine effectiveness, majorities of U.S. adults see both of these preventive qualities. About seven-in-ten say childhood vaccines help prevent serious illness among vaccinated children a great deal or quite a bit. A similar share (65%) say the same about vaccines protecting everybody in the local community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both parties share these attitudes at least somewhat, though they are more common among Democrats than Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democrats overwhelmingly think childhood vaccines do a lot to prevent illness among children (82%) and across the local community (80%).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Republicans’ views are more tepid: 57% say these vaccines do a lot to protect vaccinated children, while 52% say they do a lot to protect the community. Roughly one-in-ten say childhood vaccines &lt;em&gt;do not help much or at all&lt;/em&gt; on these fronts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Older adults and those with more education are more likely than younger and those with less education to say childhood vaccines protect both vaccinated children and the broader community, though majorities across age and education groups still say this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Pew Research Center</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 14:57:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNa0cydk50c0xFYm0wdnh2MkhqbkticDdqQ0lnRklYbUp2LXR6SzVOWGxxNFgwWTQzRDByN0hBRjNObGp0UGhpY0dxVFZqQndya2hsR3N0bGV1THZWWXZnOGR5RG1jY1lReDN3eDQ2bU0zRGF6R0xRZW5laDhCUDcxV2k3amxmamttZ29jaVFwUEFYdGtpY3VQSmZDTThNZjlPZ045YkkycTg1UWpsOFRhTmcwbXVkY00</guid></item><item><title>这个美国州的预期寿命比全国平均水平低四年-而且越来越糟糕-银河日报</title><link>https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/11/life-expectancy-in-this-u-s-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average-and-its-getting-worse/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content dynamic-entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina residents are dying younger—and not by chance. In a country already struggling with declining longevity, the Palmetto State has fallen further behind. In 2022, its average life expectancy stood at &lt;strong&gt;73.5 years&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;four full years&lt;/strong&gt; below the U.S. average of &lt;strong&gt;77.5&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Center for Health Statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That gap reflects a complex interplay of preventable risk factors: air pollution, chronic disease, limited healthcare access, and mental illness. Unlike in many high-performing states, public infrastructure in South Carolina fails to consistently support healthy behaviors or provide timely, continuous care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report from Earth.com&lt;/a&gt; highlights South Carolina’s lagging performance across multiple health indices, including access to parks, smoking prevalence, and food environment quality. Together, these indicators point to a population exposed to cumulative risk—and a state system that struggles to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, life expectancy in the United States rebounded slightly in 2022 following a COVID-induced drop, but improvements are uneven. South Carolina’s figures remain well below the national mean, a red flag for both state and federal health planners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Air Pollution and Its Long Tail on Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more insidious but well-documented drivers of early mortality is &lt;strong&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/strong&gt;, especially &lt;strong&gt;PM2.5&lt;/strong&gt;—particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. As detailed by the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, these pollutants can enter the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/air-quality-alert-issued-across-the-u-s-heres-the-full-list-of-affected-states-and-counties/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="97425" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lungs and bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;, exacerbating &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/caffeine-intake-dangerous-heart-risks/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7529" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While South Carolina doesn’t consistently exceed EPA thresholds for PM2.5, &lt;strong&gt;regional exposure hotspots&lt;/strong&gt; remain, particularly in urban centers and along industrial corridors. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthy States Index&lt;/a&gt; notes that South Carolina has a low density of public green spaces and a disproportionately high number of unhealthy food outlets—both of which discourage physical activity and limit access to healthier lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These factors aren’t incidental. The EPA warns that even low to moderate exposure to PM2.5 can increase the risk of &lt;strong&gt;premature death&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly among older adults and individuals with preexisting heart or lung disease. South Carolina’s uneven air quality and built environment reflect national trends in health disparity—rural, low-income, and nonwhite communities tend to bear the heaviest burden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mental Illness Cuts Deeper Than Suicide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pivotal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analyzed over 200 studies and found that individuals with mental disorders face more than double the risk of early death compared to the general population. On average, mental illness shortens life by &lt;strong&gt;10 years&lt;/strong&gt;—often not through suicide, but through &lt;strong&gt;natural causes&lt;/strong&gt; like cardiovascular disease, infection, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review found that &lt;strong&gt;67.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of deaths in people with mental disorders were due to physical illness, not external causes. Despite this, many states—including South Carolina—lack adequate psychiatric infrastructure. Rural areas in particular remain designated as &lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas&lt;/strong&gt;, according to data from the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the issue, mental illness is tightly linked to &lt;strong&gt;higher rates of tobacco use&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;poor diet&lt;/strong&gt;—each of which magnifies risk for premature death. The state’s &lt;strong&gt;elevated smoking prevalence&lt;/strong&gt;, cited in the &lt;em&gt;Earth.com&lt;/em&gt; report, remains above national averages despite public health campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Broken Links in Care and Follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another structural issue driving South Carolina’s longevity gap is &lt;strong&gt;continuity of care&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;Earth.com&lt;/em&gt; analysis, the state shows elevated &lt;strong&gt;hospital readmission rates&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting significant deficiencies in post-discharge support and care coordination. For patients with chronic illnesses, follow-up visits, access to medications, and transportation to clinics are often lacking—especially in rural or low-income zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readmission rates serve as a proxy for overall system performance. High figures often point to underinvestment in &lt;strong&gt;preventive care&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;primary medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;social support services&lt;/strong&gt;. In a region with high rates of &lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hypertension&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;, these gaps can compound quickly into excess mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; further reinforce the link between chronic disease and early death. In 2022, heart disease and cancer remained the two leading causes of mortality nationwide. Both are heavily influenced by behavior, environment, and system-level access to early detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Geography of Health Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s four-year life expectancy gap is not an anomaly—it is an early warning. The disparity reflects a widening health divide between high-income, infrastructure-rich regions and those where systems are under-resourced or absent altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications are economic as well as epidemiological. Poorer health outcomes increase state healthcare costs, reduce workforce productivity, and impose a heavier burden on safety-net services. Public health is infrastructure, and its erosion has measurable downstream effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State averages can also obscure deep &lt;strong&gt;intra-state variation&lt;/strong&gt;. Some counties in South Carolina outperform the national average, while others lag by nearly a decade. These pockets of high risk, shaped by poverty, pollution, and limited access to services, reinforce the urgent need for targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
