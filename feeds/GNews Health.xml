Members are also much less likely to suffer the chronic diseases that have been linked to modern lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are nine times less likely to be obese, which in turn lowers their risk of some of the country's biggest killers: &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-adacd440-45fe-11f0-acc0-978aa44020ec" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even rates of mental illnesses are lower. One study estimated the rate of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-0d10e470-460f-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; among the Amish to be less than one percent compared to about 13 percent of the general population at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2007 study projected that 10 percent of Amish women experience anxiety compared to 28 percent of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small communities are spread mostly throughout &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-a0a84720-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-a0a82010-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6" class=""&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-a0a70ea0-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6" class=""&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; numbering around 400,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-11895705/Amish-teen-shares-glimpse-life-community-REALLY-like-embarks-Rumspringa.html"&gt;close-knit and removed&lt;/a&gt; from most of the toxins ubiquitous in everyday 21st century life, from processed foods to highway pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health researchers have long viewed Amish communities as isolated worlds - unique, self-contained populations that remain essentially unchanged after more than 300 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish communities live largely agrarian lives, with people from age 6 to 60 working in the fields, kitchens and homes without modern machines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They lead agrarian lifestyles, with everyone from children to elders working together in fields or small businesses, kitchens and homes, often without modern machinery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this physically active, family-centered way of life fosters deep fulfillment, self worth and enduring mental and physical vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These qualities, which many argue have been eroded, protect the mind against depression and the brain against Alzheimer's disease, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tobacco use in Amish communities is up to 40 percent lower than in the general population, contributing to far fewer tobacco-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of cancers, including those linked to tobacco use, were shown in one 2010 study of Ohio Amish communities to be &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19779840/"&gt;40 percent lower&lt;/a&gt; than non-Amish Ohioans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They are nine times less likely to be obese, which in turn lowers their risk of some of the country's biggest killers: cancer , heart disease and dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For religious reasons, alcohol consumption is also uncommon - in an Ohio Amish community, just 6 percent of men and under 2 percent of women reported drinking, compared to around 60 to 70 percent of average Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have also found some Amish people in Indiana possess a gene mutation that allows them&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://magazine.northwestern.edu/news/amish-fountain-of-youth-genetic-mutation-protects-some-amish-against-aging"&gt; to live 10 percent longer&lt;/a&gt;, keeps their blood vessels healthy, and insulin levels low. This mutation reduces levels of a protein called PAI-1, which plays a key role in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here's a breakdown of how the truly unplugged lifestyle contributes to good health, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8857275/#R42"&gt;NIH-funded research&lt;/a&gt; and academic studies on Amish cultural and health norms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;They're constantly active&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every Amish community member between the ages of 6 and 60 is physically active from sunrise through sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men and women in an Amish community in Aylmer, Ontario, get &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14707772/"&gt;between three and 10 hours&lt;/a&gt; of vigorous exercise a week and take around 14,000 to 18,000 steps daily - this doesn't drop off even as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to children who are not Amish, Lancaster Amish children spend nearly an extra hour each day being active, especially through moderate to vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;They eat from their own land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish communities typically eat fresh, chemical-free foods that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21317401/"&gt;come from their farms&lt;/a&gt; and gardens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Butter is &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22026912/"&gt;churned at home&lt;/a&gt;, bread is baked fresh every day, and vegetables are hand-harvested and eaten within four hours of being picked, which locks in more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Caroline Brock, a sociologist focusing on Amish farming and food systems at the University of Missouri, told the Daily Mail that, 'In general, more [Amish people] on average would have a small garden with a handful of chickens, a cow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families may not grow their own wheat (they buy their flour and other basic necessities), but 'they're eating more vegetables from their garden and they spend less money on food on average,' Dr. Brock said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Amish also tend to avoid sweeteners, only using a tablespoon of honey or maple syrup a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they cultivate most of their food, Amish communities aren't exposed to the hidden added sugars, preservatives and food dyes in much of our processed foods. Their produce is also cultivated without the use of carcinogenic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By growing and storing  their own food, Amish communities avoid hidden sugars, preservatives and dyes found in store-bought foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Fermented foods are a staple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families regularly eat fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickled vegetables and homemade yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many Amish families start meals with three tablespoons of fermented vegetables, which help support digestion and gut health by feeding good bacteria into the digestive system, according to the NIH study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A balanced gut microbiome has been linked to stronger immunity, better digestion and lower rates of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Their biggest meal is at noon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish meals are carefully timed to work with the body's natural circadian rhythms. The largest meal of the day takes place between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., when the sun is highest in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to fueling a labor-intensive day, front-loading &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9605877/"&gt;calories early &lt;/a&gt;helps balance energy and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Amish folks stick to traditional food prep methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of relying on processed, shelf-stable foods with harmful additives, Amish communities use canning, pickling and fermenting methods to store their fresh fruits, vegetables and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Canning locks in nutrients at their peak freshness and pickling preserves the food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While fermentation both preserves food and can enhance its nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish life centers on close family, church and community ties that protect against depression and anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish families wake at dawn and turn in after sunset, naturally syncing with circadian rhythms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;No screen time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Amish shun modern technological comforts,&lt;span&gt; navigating without Google Maps and communicating without social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living without TVs, smartphones or computers means fewer hours are spent watching news alerts, seeing advertisements and scrolling social media, which can trigger feelings of anxiety and inadequacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Business owners in the community may share a phone with other families or with a non-Amish person, Dr. Brock said, but modern technology is not a daily presence in most Amish people's lives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown excessive smartphone use has a deleterious effect on people's mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10587281/#Sec2"&gt;on Australian adults&lt;/a&gt; measured their phone usage based on a questionnaire that asked them to rate statements like, 'There are times when I would rather use the smartphone than deal with other more pressing issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who use their phones a little to a moderate amount had a lower average depression score of 12.1, while those with very high smartphone use had a score of 17.8 - higher scores indicate more severe symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Minimal exposure to toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without cars, Amish people are exposed to less air pollution, and their reliance on homegrown foods means they avoid the synthetic chemicals, preservatives and additives in most grocery store items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up on farms, Amish children are also exposed to a mix of natural microbes in soil, animals and fresh air, a factor researchers believe contributes to their low rates of asthma and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/news-items/study-finds-amish-childrens-exposures-protect-against-asthma/"&gt;5 percent of Amish schoolchildren&lt;/a&gt; ages 6 to 14 have asthma, which is about half of the US average (10.3 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Tobacco and alcohol use is extremely rare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some Amish men use tobacco, its use overall is far less prevalent compared to non-Amish communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2009 study of Amish people living in Ohio found that community members &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-009-9435-7"&gt;had a 37&lt;/a&gt; percent lower rate of tobacco-related cancers compared to other adults in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking alcohol is also rare in Amish communities. In one study, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2742796/"&gt;just 6.4 percent of men and 1.7 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; reported consuming booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[In the Old Order Amish sect] the communion is twice a year, and they use real alcoholic wine,' Dr. Brock said. 'It's a functional thing. It's used to preserve food. But they're not going to drink for drinking's sake.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Compared to children who are not Amish, Lancaster Amish children in Pennsylvania spend nearly an extra hour each day being active, especially through moderate to vigorous exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Sleep aligns with nature's clock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families wake at dawn and turn in after sunset, naturally syncing with circadian rhythms, which makes it easier to fall asleep and wake as daylight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2011 study looking into Amish sleep patterns found that members of the community &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079946/#sec18"&gt;consistently went to bed&lt;/a&gt; between 9-10 p.m. and woke up at 5:30 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sticking to a consistent sleep schedule has been linked to a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11212029/"&gt;lower risk of dying&lt;/a&gt;, reduced &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29776774/"&gt;risk of mood disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-heart-disease-risks"&gt;better heart health&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aligning one's sleep in this way supports better hormone regulation (including melatonin), boosts mood and cognitive function, and reduces the risk of developing metabolic conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Amish people value strong community bonds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish life is deeply rooted in close-knit family ties, involvement in the church and maintaining in-person connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This creates a strong social fabric that provides emotional support and a sense of belonging, which protects against depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Part of why they have the rules around technology that they do is to emphasize labor that they can do together as a family and as a community,' Dr. Brock said, using a dishwasher as an example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Washing dishes] is something that children can do together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily rituals, such as gathering to share what they are grateful for and community celebrations, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950386825000085#:~:text=For%20each%20unit%20of%20increase,/%CE%B2%20=%20%E2%88%920.049)."&gt;keep people's minds sharp&lt;/a&gt;

Why do these youngsters develop &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atopic-eczema/"&gt;atopic eczema&lt;/a&gt; when their friends do not – especially if they share similar environments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team has been looking into whether a child’s genetic profile influences the risk of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing a set of data involving children from several countries, the experts uncovered hints that a household &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/national-puppy-day-2025-where-happiness-meets-responsibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; might help offset some of the genetic factors behind itchy skin irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sara Brown from the University of Edinburgh’s &lt;a href="http://The%20Institute%20of%20Genetics%20and%20Cancer%20%20%20https://g.co/kgs/DQMJEzs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute of Genetics and Cancer&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Marie Standl from &lt;a href="https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Helmholtz Munich&lt;/a&gt; contributed to this work and brought fresh insight into how these influences might unfold for families everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-eczema-in-children"&gt;Understanding eczema in children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eczema involves red, inflamed patches that can be difficult to soothe. This condition arises from a blend of inherited makeup and influences such as early-life bacterial contact or exposure to specific animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a family history of dry skin issues does not guarantee a child will develop it, but it raises the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have wondered why certain kids with a genetic variant live free of symptoms while others encounter a lifetime of creams and lotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db460.htm#Key_finding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; note that 7.3% of adults aged 18 and over have eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have long suspected that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/are-dogs-replacing-children-how-modern-society-is-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; might play a protective part for some children, and this new investigation adds support to that theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-may-protect-children-from-eczema"&gt;Dogs may protect children from eczema&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families with a pet dog often report that their kids seem to have fewer episodes of skin flare-ups. The researchers wanted to see if this pattern held up at a molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on a segment of DNA near the interleukin-7 receptor (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17660817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IL-7R&lt;/a&gt;), which helps the body regulate immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that genetic make-up affects a child’s risk of developing eczema and previous studies have shown that owning a pet dog may be protective,” said Professor Brown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part of the study found that children with a slight twist in that gene could sidestep the usual risk for eczema if they had a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-our-relationships-with-dogs-matter-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; in their household early in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-siblings-might-help-reduce-eczema-risk"&gt;Siblings might help reduce eczema risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also noticed that having older brothers or sisters might offer some protection. Observations point to a possible link between exposure to unique bacteria from siblings and a child’s reaction to environmental triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to confirm how varied bacterial environments influence the genetic component of eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not every preventive measure works for everyone, and that’s precisely why gene-environment studies are crucial,” said Dr. Standl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families sometimes consider adding a second child or adopting a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dogs-suffer-from-the-january-blues-just-like-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; to reduce eczema risk. Not every measure works for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-don-t-work-for-every-eczema-case"&gt;Dogs don’t work for every eczema case&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists emphasize that having a dog from day one does not guarantee eczema-free skin. The recent work did not examine the effects of dogs on treating existing cases of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many professionals caution that introducing an animal might irritate symptoms that are already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that contact with dog-related bacteria might shape a child’s immune response in ways that shift how that interleukin-7 receptor behaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this gene variation is not the only cause of eczema, it appears to be important in controlling inflammation. Early-life dog exposure could modify that gene’s effect so the skin’s defensive barriers stay in better shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-diversity-in-research-matters"&gt;Why diversity in research matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings draw primarily from white European participants, prompting calls for more studies in other populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eczema affects millions of people &lt;a href="https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, including groups with differing genetic backgrounds. A broader pool of participants will help clarify how these discoveries apply to families everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents often wonder if a dog in the home might lower the odds of their child facing red, itchy skin every night. These early results support the idea that dog ownership might help in specific genetic situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More data from a wider range of people will show whether the same pattern exists in other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eczema-genetics-and-the-future"&gt;Eczema, genetics, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts continue exploring the interplay between genetic traits and outside factors to better understand why some children develop eczema. They aim to refine the science so parents have straightforward answers about potential lifestyle steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work may also investigate whether other pets or environmental exposures shape this immune balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team believes that continuing to map the roles of various gene variants could open the door to targeted prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can stay alert to new findings on additional ways to keep a child’s skin barrier strong. They may also want to consult a pediatrician before making major decisions, especially if a youngster already struggles with chronic irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.16605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 16:06:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQWnBtdWVlNzlXeWl6NndSaFJ6Y3pXNEZkcjhXTTJjNUxfektzdkRCaVBTZHdJYXlIY3Q4aTEtejhVblJrUXdhUmhfTmpsYlRLcTY1c0NOeFlMT0dLVmxxQ0Z0WVFfUTkwTkc0MkNPTG8ybnE4b3dZVzBwRDJfX1FDNGtlMXE</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，每个人都有独特的“呼吸印记” -《纽约时报》 | Each Person Has a Unique ‘Breath Print,’ Scientists Find - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBQa2k1TzZCV2RnR1VFeF9relEtRVZJTkxKcWllUE1CU1B5Z3NHbjZCNm9POG5UekVCMU9wMkJaWEpIc2xtbGR5bG9kNE9VS3huajd5RWR0cVpiOXVmbkhneUwyUFVjc1hudFRGUUNtU0dXOXotRmpuRWhBejE3cTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 15:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBQa2k1TzZCV2RnR1VFeF9relEtRVZJTkxKcWllUE1CU1B5Z3NHbjZCNm9POG5UekVCMU9wMkJaWEpIc2xtbGR5bG9kNE9VS3huajd5RWR0cVpiOXVmbkhneUwyUFVjc1hudFRGUUNtU0dXOXotRmpuRWhBejE3cTQ</guid></item><item><title>发现主要的糖替代品会损害脑血管细胞功能，构成潜在的中风风险- Medical Xpress | Major sugar substitute found to impair brain blood vessel cell function, posing potential stroke risk - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQQVBpVFFFN0s0bm5UY0JJU3NjWFVFVGRtSTFxV241STlNTGJQZDVKeTVJbTRYZS1HdlRHVFpSNS1BNkFMclAzeFNjQzV2UHFQNjhHT0lpYTRrbW9lMV9PcDNXVVZ2b3pQbkhBSUpHN0ZEcTh4Wno5ZWZ6Yl9NRjh2QWJ6d2J0QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol may impair cellular functions essential to maintaining brain blood vessel health, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder. Findings suggest that erythritol increases oxidative stress, disrupts nitric oxide signaling, raises vasoconstrictive peptide production, and diminishes clot-dissolving capacity in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Erythritol has become a fixture in the ingredient lists of protein bars, low-calorie beverages, and diabetic-friendly baked goods. Its appeal lies in its sweetness-to-calorie ratio, roughly 60–80% as sweet as sucrose with a tiny fraction of the energy yield, and its negligible effect on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;. Erythritol is also synthesized endogenously from glucose and fructose via the pentose phosphate pathway, leaving baseline levels subject to both dietary and metabolic influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about erythritol's safety have escalated following epidemiological studies linking higher plasma concentrations with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Positive associations between circulating erythritol and incidence of heart attack and stroke have been observed in U.S. and European cohorts, independent of known cardiometabolic risk factors. A causal mechanism for the link has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "The Non-Nutritive Sweetener Erythritol Adversely Affects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell Function," &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed in vitro experiments to test the cellular consequences of erythritol exposure on cerebral endothelial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells were cultured and exposed to an amount of erythritol equivalent to consuming a typical beverage. Experimental conditions included five biological replicates per group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Cellular assays measured &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidant protein expression, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelin production, and fibrinolytic capacity. Capillary electrophoresis immunoassay and ELISA were used to quantify expression of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), catalase, endothelial &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nitric+oxide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nitric oxide&lt;/a&gt; synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells exposed to erythritol exhibited a substantial increase in oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species levels rose by approximately 75% relative to untreated controls. Antioxidant defense markers were also elevated, with SOD-1 expression increasing by approximately 45% and catalase by approximately 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide production declined by nearly 20% in response to erythritol. Although total eNOS expression remained unchanged, phosphorylation at the Ser1177 site, which is associated with enzymatic activation, fell by approximately 33%. In contrast, phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr495 site increased by approximately 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another test, t-PA release in response to thrombin stimulation was blunted in erythritol-treated cells, indicating reduced fibrinolytic responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conclude that erythritol exposure disrupts multiple mechanisms vital to maintaining cerebral endothelial health. Although results are limited to acute in vitro conditions, the findings align with prior epidemiological associations between erythritol and elevated stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors recommend further investigation using long-term and in vivo models, citing the need for clinical studies to clarify whether repeated dietary exposure to erythritol carries cerebrovascular consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;When you think of longevity in animals, chances are that the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-400-year-old-shark-may-hold-the-cure-to-aging-1785144189"&gt;Greenland shark&lt;/a&gt; will immediately come up. After all, researchers &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/greenland-shark.html"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that the enigmatic animal can live for &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 250 years. It turns out, however, that bats also hold their own when it comes to lifespan, with some species living up to 25 years—equivalent to 180 human years—and they tend to do it cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Rochester (UR) have investigated anti-cancer “superpowers,” as described in a UR &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/why-dont-bats-get-cancer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, in four bat species: the little brown bat, the big brown bat, the cave nectar bat, and the Jamaican fruit bat. The results of their investigation could have important implications for treating cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Longer lifespans with more cell divisions, and longer exposure to exo- [external] and endogenous [internal] stressors increase cancer incidence,” the researchers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59403-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Nature Communications. “However, despite their exceptional lifespans, few to no tumors have been reported in long-lived wild and captive populations of bats.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Led by biologists Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov from the UR Department of Biology and Wilmot Cancer Institute, the team identified a number of biological defenses that help bats avoid the disease. For example, bats have a tumor-suppressor gene, called p53. Specifically, little brown bats carry two copies of the gene, and have high p53 activity, which can get rid of cancer cells during &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/apoptosis#:~:text=Apoptosis%20is%20the%20process%20of,a%20role%20in%20preventing%20cancer."&gt;apoptosis,&lt;/a&gt; a biological process that eliminates unwanted cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that some bat species have evolved enhanced p53 activity as an additional anti-cancer strategy, similar to elephants,” the researchers explained. Too much p53, though, runs the risk of killing too many cells. Clearly, bats are able to find the right apoptosis balance. Humans also have p53, but mutations in the gene—which disrupt its anti-cancer properties—exist in around 50% of human cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed the enzyme telomerase. In bats, the telomerase expression allows bat cells to multiply endlessly. That means they don’t undergo replicative senescence: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804996000585"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that restricts cell proliferation to a certain number of divisions. Since, according to the study, senescence “promotes age-related inflammation contributing to the aging process,” bats’ lack thereof would seem to promote longevity. And while indefinite cell proliferation might sound like the perfect cancer hotbed, bats’ high p53 activity can kill off any cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “bats have unique immune systems which allows them to survive a wide range of deadly viruses, and many unique immune adaptations have been described in bats,” the researchers wrote. “Most knowledge of the bat immune systems comes from studies of bat tolerance to viral infections deadly to humans. However, these or similar immune adaptations may also recognize and eliminate tumors,” as well as “temper inflammation, which may have an anticancer effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cells have to go through several steps, or “oncogenic hits,” to become harmful cancerous cells. Surprisingly, the researchers also found that it only takes two hits for normal bat cells to become malignant, meaning bats aren’t naturally resistant to cancer—they just have “robust tumor-suppressor mechanisms,” as described in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings carry important implications for treating cancer. Specifically, the study confirms that increased p53 activity—which is already targeted by some anti-cancer drugs—can eliminate or slow cancer growth. More broadly, their research is yet another example of scientists turning to nature for solutions to human &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-robot-is-part-bee-part-crane-fly-and-it-finally-has-solid-legs-2000591586"&gt;challenges on all scales&lt;/a&gt;. Though the study focuses on bats, the ultimate aim is, always, finding a cure for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Bullock, Nevada State Medical Epidemiologist, told local 2 News Nevada: 'We urge people to be aware of any signs of rodent activity and to take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone who has been in contact with rodents, nests or droppings and subsequently develops symptoms consistent with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome should see a health care provider immediately.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No details are known about the two people who have tested positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce risk of exposure, state health officials recommend airing out spaces where mice droppings could be, avoid sweeping droppings, use disinfectant and wipe up debris, and wear gloves and a mask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide that are &lt;span&gt;spread to people when they inhale aerosolized fecal matter, urine, or saliva from infected rodents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rarity of hantavirus in the US is partly because the country has fewer rodent species that the illness can circulate amongst, compared to Asia and Europe, where multiple rodent species act as hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-84933260-478f-11f0-b334-8beb2a687d4a" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Tech researchers found that while deer mice are still the primary reservoir for hantaviruses in North America, the virus is now circulating more widely than previously thought, with antibodies detected in six additional rodent species where they had not been documented before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Virginia Tech team &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/04/hantavirus-environmental-factors-influence-distribution-paanwaris-paansri-luis-escobar.html"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network to better understand how hantavirus spreads in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2014 and 2019, the program gathered and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 different mouse species at 45 locations across the US to test for levels of hantavirus antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Debbie Zipperian, from Montana, survived Hantavirus after being diagnosed with the disease at 46.

&lt;p&gt;An active compound in ginger root may inhibit the growth of cancer tumors via a sabotage of their metabolic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in Nature Scientific Reports by a team at Osaka Metropolitan University (OMU), the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-00131-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that a ginger-derived molecule known as EMC shuts down the cells’ fat-making machinery, causing it to activate backup systems and potentially become vulnerable to detection or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a century of serious innovation and research into cancer and its prevention and treatment, we still don’t fully understand a cancer tumor’s diet so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cancer’s key characteristic is its ability to reprogram normal energy metabolism to sustain the uncontrolled proliferation that allows it to spread through the organism. This leads to distinct metabolic traits compared to normal cells, among which has been the nearly 100-year-old supposition that cancers rely on glycolysis for primary energy production—an observation known as the Warburg effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For readers who remembered their high school biology textbook, glycolysis is the process of turning stored energy (glycogen) into available energy (glucose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note however that cancer metabolism is subject to ongoing research, and they themselves present in their paper evidence of cancer cells relying on &lt;em&gt;de novo &lt;/em&gt;fatty acid synthesis to sustain their growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolically speaking, fatty acids produce more energy per molecule than sugars, but instead of using fatty acids from food, the cancer cells produce their own, hence the Latin descriptor “&lt;em&gt;de novo,&lt;/em&gt;” or “of new creation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa at OMU, analyzed ethyl p-methoxycinnamate or EMC, a main component of kencur ginger, found commonly in Indonesian, Chinese, and Thai cuisine, for an inhibitory effect on cancer cells—something which his team had previously uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the team was specifically hoping to see if its inhibitory effect was related to cancer metabolism. Results revealed that the acid ester inhibits energy production by disrupting &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; fatty acid synthesis and fat metabolism, rather than through glycolysis as commonly theorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the researchers discovered application of the EMC triggered increased glycolysis, which they supposed was a survival mechanism in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOOD AS MEDICINE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Manuka Honey Reduces Breast Cancer Cell Growth by 84% in Human Cells and Mice" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/manuka-honey-reduces-breast-cancer-cell-growth-by-84-in-human-cells-and-mice/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Manuka Honey Reduces Breast Cancer Cell Growth by 84% in Human Cells and Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings not only provide new insights that supplement and expand the theory of the Warburg effect, which can be considered the starting point of cancer metabolism research, but are also expected to lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of new treatment methods,” stated Professor Kojima-Yuasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cell-cycle checkpoint is a moment in the life cycle of a cell when, following a period of growth and DNA synthesis, a control mechanism determines whether to further grow the cell or terminate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE GOOD FOOD: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Keep Out All the Christmas Spices – They’re Powerful Antioxidants Known as ‘Nutraceuticals’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/christmas-spices-are-powerful-antioxidants-known-as-nutraceuticals/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Keep Out All the Christmas Spices – They’re Powerful Antioxidants Known as ‘Nutraceuticals’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancers need tremendous energy to fuel their growth, and the authors write that when conditions of an energy deficit are detected at a cell-cycle checkpoint, it’s a common red flag that can lead to the cell cycle being arrested or terminated altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knocking out the primary method of energy generation may help highlight an energy deficit at a cell-cycle checkpoint during the early stages of malignancy, though this was not investigated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — Global Fatty Liver Day is observed on June 12, and there is a growing effort to raise awareness on what is described as one of the most underdiagnosed and misunderstood health threats: fatty liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once considered a niche concern, it is now a growing global epidemic affecting more than one in four adults worldwide, according to recent estimates by the Global Liver Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They looked at the biopsy, they ran several other tests, and that's when he said there is no cure,” Pam Miller said that is what doctors told her when she was diagnosed in 2001.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have approximately six years to live. Hopefully, they'll have a cure by then.”  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s fatty liver disease was at Stage Four, and there is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has led to approved medications specifically for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], and several promising drugs are now in late-stage trials, offering hope to millions.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller shared that she participates in clinical trials at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'm helping my children and my grandchildren and everybody to come,” she said. “They watch you really closely, and so I'm thankful for all my doctors and stuff that have kept me here.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], often flies under the radar. Many people with NAFLD have no symptoms—until the condition advances to its more severe form, NASH, which can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical experts advise that fatty liver disease is preventable. Risk factors include obesity, insulin resistance, high cholesterol, and sedentary lifestyles, all of which are on the rise globally. But the lack of public awareness, routine screening, and even medical training around NAFLD has created a gap in both prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the statistics are sobering, experts remain hopeful. Fatty liver disease, particularly in its early stages, is reversible. A combination of modest weight loss, healthy eating, and regular physical activity can significantly improve liver health, sometimes in just a few months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

            “We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” wrote the organizations – including major professional groups for obstetricians, primary care providers, pediatricians, pharmacists and nurses – in an &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;. “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsd1wn600043b6mvytypov3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter calls on “payers and insurers to continue making the COVID-19 vaccine available to pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” even though the shots have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/children-covid-vaccine-cdc"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the list of vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdl8q0000u3b6mowt6zqwb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl84cg300033b6mbkyz85t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter comes two weeks after US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly announced that the Covid-19 vaccine, which has shown to be safe and effective during pregnancy, would no longer be recommended for pregnant people. Leaders from the US Food and Drug Administration also recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/covid-vaccine-fda-changes"&gt;outlined a new framework&lt;/a&gt; for the approval process for Covid-19 vaccines that could limit shots to older Americans and people at higher risk of serious Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbpcp37q00093b6mkqoefzuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts immediately warned that these changes could create new barriers to vaccines for those who want them, including confusion around who is eligible and higher costs for patients if insurance no longer covers them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsd53se000a3b6mfly4ftvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Pharmacists Association, which signed on to the open letter, said it has already received reports of patients being denied Covid-19 vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsaea0a00013b6mstltfjh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leigh Haldeman, 33, a nurse at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle who is pregnant, told CNN that she tried twice to get vaccinated last week and was turned away.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700023b6mbddydesb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because of some complications I had during my first pregnancy, getting the vaccine now and getting that extra boost of immunity would be definitely important for me,” said Haldeman, who got her last shot in the fall of 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700033b6mxthdq0su@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At two different pharmacies, she was told it is not recommended for pregnant women to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, based on new guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdm1jf000z3b6m8gg8w3ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She still hasn’t been able to get the shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdi047000o3b6m7lj8nde5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors still strongly recommend Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdi6of000r3b6moejwt88y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement. “It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdola800153b6mr7a7auym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After an appointment last week, Haldeman agreed with her obstetrician’s advice to get an additional Covid-19 shot during her pregnancy. Her first try was a Walgreens store where she had an appointment to get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700053b6mafo0n2v5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I went through the whole check-in process, and then as soon as the pharmacist saw that I was pregnant, they were like, ‘We cannot give this to you,’ ” she recounted. “ ‘We’re only giving it to immunocompromised people right now.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700063b6mvqvbp203@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she asked whether she was considered immunocompromised because she’s pregnant. Haldeman said the pharmacist responded that guidelines have changed, that it’s not recommended and they wouldn’t give it to her.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblbowqg00233b6m3ewml3p2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She then called her primary care provider and obstetrician, but neither had the vaccine in stock. In past years, pharmacies have administered the majority of Covid-19 shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700083b6mi0ylrw17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Walgreens spokesperson told CNN, “We continue to closely monitor and review all federal and state guidance related to vaccines. As regulations and recommendations evolve, we remain committed to ensuring our pharmacy teams have the latest information to support patient care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700093b6maymyx5kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Haldeman said her obstetrician suggested trying another pharmacy. She called a Safeway and asked, “I’m 25 weeks pregnant. My provider is recommending that I get this Covid booster. Are you able to give that to me?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000b3b6mmlz4qb3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The immediate answer was no.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000c3b6mv455mlpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m under the impression from my provider that I need to get this,” she recalled saying. “Pharmacies are the only people that appear to have it right now. What do I need to do to get this vaccine?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsec9m4001d3b6m7m2s3j23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the pharmacist told her, “The guidelines have changed as of last Friday. We can’t give it to you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsopzr200033b6m5z28thpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharmacist suggested that Haldeman try getting a prescription for the vaccine from her provider so the pharmacy might be able to administer it. Her obstetrician wrote a vaccination prescription and sent it to the Safeway pharmacy, but when Haldeman visited the location at 7 p.m. the same day, she was told the pharmacy hadn’t received the prescription.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblcex8x00003b6mq0hz836s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a statement from a company spokesperson, Safeway parent company Albertsons told CNN, “In accordance with recently updated CDC guidance, we adjusted our COVID-19 vaccination policies. Pregnant individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness remain eligible for vaccination. We encourage all customers to consult with their healthcare providers for personalized advice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbtb0cra00003b6m3iojy2xj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The lack of clarity left Haldeman frustrated and uncertain about what to do next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000g3b6mgleulsou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I spent half my day on this. … Most people are probably not going to go to those lengths to get the vaccine. The more hoops that you make people jump through, less and less people are just going to get vaccinated,” Haldeman said. “And we know that having Covid during pregnancy does terrible things to your placenta, and certainly reducing that risk is worth it. So it’s very frustrating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbs98lzq00023b6m9uavkgs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Pharmacists Association &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-withholds-endorsement-of-acip-adult-immunization-schedule" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a news release that the updates to the Covid-19 recommendations “do not appear to be based on the scientific evidence provided over the past few years. … COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been proven safe and effective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl8r7qf001d3b6mpe37lqi6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, pharmacists “may face consequences if they do not follow the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or CDC recommendations,” said Allison Hill, the association’s director of professional affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblafeuc001l3b6mmeqxlhtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS’s and CDC’s recent changes to the Covid-19 recommendations create barriers and confusion,” Hill said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbs9wmg600083b6mm8g75av9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS’s unusual updates to the Covid-19 vaccine schedules were followed this week by a sweeping change to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the independent experts who typically guide the agency on its vaccine recommendations. Kennedy bypassed ACIP in making the Covid-19 changes and then &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; this week that he had dismissed the entire 17-member panel. On Wednesday, Kennedy announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel"&gt;eight new members&lt;/a&gt; to ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsa1q4o000g3b6mgywqcf6g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The removal of the vaccine advisers sparked a swift backlash from health care providers and professional organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqn9voh00023b6mq8hpgvnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, another organization that signed the open letter, said that undermining the integrity of ACIP is “completely unfounded” and has “a significant negative impact on Americans of all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqxzjed00003b6my4oc7j4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharmacists association said&lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-alarmed-by-elimination-of-acip-voting-membership" target="_blank"&gt; Tuesday,&lt;/a&gt; “It is highly concerning that removing 17 scientists overnight eliminates the historical knowledge, scientific training, and clinical expertise required to equip pharmacists and the public to make appropriate choices for health based upon the risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsesdv6001j3b6mnv34ptkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since Kennedy announced changes to the Covid-19 vaccine schedule, doctors said they’re worried about their patients and the future of vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbse8c8800183b6mbtavqvkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. “We are concerned about access implications and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy. And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsba5xu000v3b6m5m1dvcgu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37763105/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that infants who are born after a Covid-19 infection during pregnancy are at increased risk of stillbirth, respiratory distress and low birth weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblcsse300013b6mftu19cbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With maternal health being compromised, you have the risk for preterm delivery, babies that are born very small or potentially even fetal loss early on,” Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Baylor College of Medicine, said last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000l3b6mu1q0pt0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. John Lynch, an associate medical director at the Harborview Medical Center and a colleague of Haldeman’s, said Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy also has benefits for the newborn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000m3b6mlim1uks1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccinating a mom leads to the protection of the baby when they don’t have their own immune response,” Lynch said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000n3b6mu7wra39p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the Covid vaccine is not available to babies younger than 6 months, vaccinating the mother may be the safest way for young children to gain some immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000o3b6mqyy7pu6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That first year of life remains the highest period of risk, and this is a vaccine-preventable disease,” Muñoz said. “We can modify the outcomes for these babies through maternal vaccination and through infant vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Skinner has been concerned for years about the effects of certain chemicals on girls’ puberty, she told me in an email.

The parents involved are responding to a nationwide trend: The average age of menarche in the US &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/31/nx-s1-4985074/girls-are-getting-their-first-periods-earlier-heres-what-parents-should-know"&gt;has shifted earlier&lt;/a&gt;, from 12.5 between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 between 2000 and 2005, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141"&gt;according to a 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The percentage of kids who get their first period before age 9 is also on the rise, more than doubling between the 1950s and the 2000s. Researchers are concerned about these trends because getting a first period earlier is associated with an increased risk of some health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/well/live/girls-period-menstrual-cycle-study.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has weighed in on the matter, &lt;a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-kennedy-sperm-testosterone-teens-fox-b2737911.html"&gt;claiming in an April appearance&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News that “girls are hitting puberty six years early.” He appeared to link the issue to children’s diets, arguing that “the food our kids are eating today is not really food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But experts say the shift toward earlier periods likely stems from a variety of factors, including increased nutrition, higher body weight, stress, and environmental influences. Researchers are particularly concerned about the impact of chemicals called endocrine disruptors, which can mimic the activity of hormones in the body, said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/shruthi-mahalingaiah/"&gt;Shruthi Mahalingaiah&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of environmental, reproductive, and women’s health at Harvard University. These chemicals include &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/well/phthalates-heart-disease.html"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, which can be present in shampoos, lotions, and other common products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some experts say it makes sense for parents to try to limit kids’ exposure to endocrine disruptors, but it’s impossible to avoid these compounds completely. And some say that expecting families to reverse a large-scale health trend — especially one involving something as intimate as menstruation — forces parents to become hypervigilant and could even put their kids at risk of eating disorders. “I definitely don’t think that it should be on individual parents to save their daughters from this possibly overblown idea of early menarche being a problem,” Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian and host of the podcast &lt;a href="https://rethinkingwellness.substack.com/podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rethinking Wellness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-earlier-periods-could-be-a-problem" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why earlier periods could be a problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Experts are worried about the shift toward earlier menstruation because an earlier age at first period is linked with a variety of health risks, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/31/nx-s1-4985074/girls-are-getting-their-first-periods-earlier-heres-what-parents-should-know"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and several reproductive cancers. Some research also suggests an increased risk of anxiety and depression, &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/roopa-kanakatti-shankar/2359824"&gt;Roopa Kanakatti Shankar&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Getting a period at a younger age than their peers can also be stressful for kids. “Physically, they are reaching an adult-like state, but the cognitive development is still ongoing,” Shankar said. Managing the mechanics of pads, tampons, and tracking your cycle can be more difficult for younger kids, Mahalingaiah said (honestly, it remains a challenge for some adults). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Younger children may have a harder time handling the mood shifts that can come with the menstrual cycle, Shankar said. Girls who go through puberty earlier are also more likely to experience sexual harassment, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431614568198"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For these reasons (and others), creators like Skinner, who lives in New Zealand, are taking matters into their own hands. “The idea of delaying my daughter’s first period (menarche) as long as naturally possible isn’t about artificially controlling or fearing puberty — it’s about supporting long-term health and well-being in the face of modern environmental stressors,” she writes in her Instagram post, inviting readers to comment “DAUGHTER hormone support checklist” to learn more. Skinner &lt;a href="https://stan.store/nourished_and_vibrant?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAacwnZAdZs6bB7hULDJpeefZcmb0Bjfy0Fieus6o3C77xDhHl1YZhHYY66dWeA_aem_ffA5hxKfKcBqKtjOI_hLGA"&gt;also offers&lt;/a&gt; a variety of health coaching and “low tox” education services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Skinner clarified to me that “it’s not about ‘delaying’ their period,” but rather “creating an environment for them that doesn’t bring it on prematurely.” For her, that includes “eliminating personal care products with synthetic fragrance chemicals as well as swapping to glass and stainless steel in the kitchen in place of plastic.” She also focuses on feeding her kids “whole, real, and homemade food” about 80 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Bec Kinderman, a mom of four and homebirth advocate living in Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez"&gt;posted a similar message&lt;/a&gt; in April: “Let’s normalize pre teen girls being young, enjoying playgrounds and slowing down the onset of puberty.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kinderman, who did not respond to Vox’s request for comment, goes on to advise that parents choose whole foods over “convenience foods” that are “loaded up on seed oils and artificial ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“While as parents we can’t control everything in our child’s environment &amp;amp; their life experiences &amp;amp; circumstances, there are things we can do to try to minimize these concerns,” Kinderman writes, in a post that received over 60,000 likes. “I will be daring and say that household toxins and diet are NUMBER ONE.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="can-parents-control-kids-periods" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Can parents control kids’ periods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Several experts told me it’s reasonable for parents to try to limit endocrine-disrupting chemicals in their homes, such as by avoiding unnecessary fragrances or choosing safer cleaning products. “If you have the knowledge that you have a product that has these endocrine disruptors, and there is an alternative, to me it is reasonable to choose the one that doesn’t,” Aviva Sopher, a pediatric endocrinologist at Columbia University, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, Sopher said, it’s impossible to completely avoid these chemicals because they also occur outside the home, such as in products used on lawns and gardens. Products made without phthalates and other endocrine disruptors can also be more costly, making it harder for lower-income families to avoid them, Sopher added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, trying to influence the timing of a child’s period through diet could have unintended consequences, some say. “One of the biggest problems that can cause delayed menarche is disordered eating,” Harrison said. Indeed, a very late first period, like a very early one, is associated with health risks, possibly because of links with eating disorders, Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I worry that the goal of delaying girls’ periods unintentionally encourages restricting their eating, and also potentially masks the signs of disordered eating,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Banning all processed foods from the home could also backfire. Kids who never have access to such foods often binge when they do encounter them, Harrison said: “I see that so often in kids who are restricted and deprived of sugar or snack foods, where they end up going to friends’ houses and just like staying around the snack drawer the whole time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s worth noting, also, that real concerns around endocrine disruptors can sometimes exist alongside health misinformation. Kennedy, for example, has &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-claims-teenage-boys-113340103.html"&gt;discussed early puberty&lt;/a&gt; while also making misleading claims about &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-again-claims-autism-032802120.html"&gt;the dangers of Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and his ability to &lt;a href="/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning"&gt;find the “cause” of autism&lt;/a&gt; within a year. And seed oils, mentioned by Kinderman, are not associated with early puberty and are actually beneficial for health, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html"&gt;according to nutrition scientists&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://campsite.bio/rebeccakinderman?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae2RdPbPX3BR7hZdXwem3vKQi2JPjJSGmODLrDKVn_maewCvdOkKoZ0qfx2Pw_aem_HPyDPSaVKwZKXcsGc5A1UQ"&gt;Kinderman’s website&lt;/a&gt; also includes a link to a list of anti-vaccine resources.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Skinner agrees there’s a risk of children developing eating disorders “if parents are too fanatical about ONLY eating ‘good’ foods,” but says her 80–20 approach does not carry such a risk. “In our home we don’t demonize ANY food groups. We talk about how food makes them feel.” She doesn’t want concern about eating disorders to become an “excuse” for parents “not to take ownership for their role” — which, she says, “is to set their child up for the best chance of a healthful life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Others, however, say that placing the onus on families to prevent early menarche puts an “unfair blame and shame on parents, and especially moms,” who are still disproportionately in charge of what kids eat, Harrison said. Scientists still aren’t sure what role endocrine disruptors play in early puberty, and they are difficult to study, even for professionals because they can occur in extremely low amounts that may or may not add up over time, Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Parents who are concerned that their daughters are going through early puberty — defined as breast development beginning before age 8 — should consult a doctor, Shankar said. On a societal level, we need more research into environmental influences on puberty, including endocrine disruptors, she added. Changes to public policy could also encourage companies “to be more aware and more sensitive about what they’re putting into the products that we’re all using,” Sopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Stricter laws around air and water quality could be another way to address environmental factors along with “environmental justice regulations that keep certain groups from being disproportionately impacted by pollution,” Harrison said. (Despite Kennedy’s stated concern about earlier puberty, the Trump administration has actually &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html"&gt;rolled back dozens of laws&lt;/a&gt; around clean air and water.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“To the extent that things in our environment are affecting this trend, it’s on politicians and society,” Harrison said. “At the collective level, we need to make these changes, not put it on the individual.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Gun deaths of children rose in states that loosened gun laws after a 2010 Supreme Court decision, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/health/gun-deaths-children.html"&gt;according to a new study&lt;/a&gt;. In states that kept restrictions in place, deaths remained flat or even decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ice-detained-queens-11th-grader-at-his-immigration-hearing-officials-say"&gt;11th-grade New York City student&lt;/a&gt; was detained by immigration authorities at an asylum hearing last week, school officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just 45 percent of 7th- to 12th-graders saw college as their most likely next step after high school in 2024, down from 73 percent in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/more-teens-leaning-toward-alternative-postsecondary-options/749798/"&gt;according to a new survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My older kid and I have discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/51F/the-area-51-files/"&gt;Area 51 Files series&lt;/a&gt;, about a middle-schooler forced to relocate to a top-secret base full of aliens.

We got some responses we weren’t able to include in the final story, and one of my favorites came from a 15-year-old, who hopes to become a mechanic and create a new car “that can save the world (somehow).” As a millennial, I am constantly disappointed by the lack of &lt;a href="https://www.cars.com/articles/let-down-but-not-out-cars-com-research-reveals-millennials-still-upbeat-towards-the-auto-industry-even-without-flying-cars-419114/"&gt;flying cars&lt;/a&gt;, and I look forward to the lifesaving variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As always, you can reach me with questions or story ideas at anna.north@vox.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 11:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE54UmRYNjFZb2FPX0JzX2Zjd01LWVlWTExzR0c5VGRDeFIwQmUyTGRQY2dzUEZMRWhEbFhOdE5uX3dsTlRadE1NQkt3UTNwRXRLcnFsM2JPSEJNc3EtYmtuRWMzb1Vicjk1cEJtQjlpcWpYbERBR1hTYXlHSQ</guid></item><item><title>“Razor Blade Throat”和旅行“Nimbus” ： NB.1.8.1 COVID-19变种是什么？ - IFLScience | “Razor Blade Throat” And A Traveling “Nimbus”: What's Up With The NB.1.8.1 COVID-19 Variant? - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxPVjNJNlU1a1RUTm1zWlFpNDB6UzJwN1hmOGM1MjJNNGhmZFNrSGlFcHFxeVRxVEJJdzllakwyZDZTN0diSXVQQTdOQXRUMHl3RFFlZWZxaXZNTUUwYjRYc05UQjlwd0p2a0xQeTFwUHBmcmpjbDJyd1NUNndxTF9jVHNIdEJpWlZBbTVYckM2ckJTdkxLVDBIZ0ZXUk9XeEtQcmd0WXVjOHoyZmx6a3JMV1Nxb1dnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;Thought we’d seen the last of it? Sorry to disappoint, but there’s a new COVID-19 variant gallivanting across the globe. Its official title is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-covid-variant-nb181-detected-amid-big-changes-coming-to-vaccines-in-us-79378" target="_blank"&gt;NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt;, but some have taken to calling it “Nimbus”. In the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is just starting to ramp up, medics are bracing for a new wave of cases, but that doesn’t mean that we in the north will get off scot-free. So, what kind of symptoms are people reporting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare to experience déjà vu. So far, the symptoms of the Nimbus variant don’t seem to be hugely different from what we’ve seen with all the previous variants. As a member of the Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 variants, it makes sense that Nimbus would present very similarly to its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;familiar constellation&lt;/a&gt; of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="46" data-end="53"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Cough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="56" data-end="68"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Congestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="71" data-end="82"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="85" data-end="94"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="97" data-end="110"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Sore throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="113" data-end="136"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Fever (in some cases)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="139" data-end="174"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Gastrointestinal symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;strong&gt;nausea&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;diarrhea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms will vary from person-to-person and also depending on your vaccination status – rest assured that according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), the most recent round of COVID vaccines should still offer decent protection against the Nimbus variant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing does seem to be a bit different this time around, though. There’s been a &lt;a href="https://san.com/cc/razor-blade-throat-symptom-sparks-search-spike-as-covid-variant-spreads/" target="_blank"&gt;reported surge&lt;/a&gt; in online searches for the term “razor blade throat”, suggesting people are experiencing particularly painful sore throats just now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no guarantee that everyone with respiratory symptoms has COVID. If it’s summer where you are, it could be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-pollen-bomb-cometh-why-your-hay-fever-is-hitting-earlier-than-ever-74012" target="_blank"&gt;hay fever&lt;/a&gt;, which can be really &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/its-that-time-of-year-again-do-i-have-hay-fever-or-covid-19-75016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tricky to tell apart&lt;/a&gt; from viral infections. There are also always other viruses circulating besides SARS-CoV-2 – as we said, the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season is just kicking off, and counterintuitive though it may seem, you can catch the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-common-cold-whats-the-latest-on-preventing-and-treating-it-72935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;common cold&lt;/a&gt; at any time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive COVID test is the only way to be reasonably sure that that’s what you’ve got. As usual, the advice while you’re sick is to stay away from others as much as possible and consider &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/one-type-of-covid-mask-works-better-than-the-rest-but-any-beats-no-mask-at-all-74759" target="_blank"&gt;wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; if you have to be in contact with other people. Medicines like paracetamol (acetaminophen) can help relieve symptoms – and as a bonus, we might finally now understand &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/we-may-finally-understand-how-paracetamol-aka-tylenolr-actually-works-79549" target="_blank"&gt;how it actually works&lt;/a&gt;. We’d recommend steering clear of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/sock-onions-and-snail-slime-do-any-weird-cold-remedies-actually-work-77904" target="_blank"&gt;sock onions&lt;/a&gt; though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you have any symptoms that concern you, particularly things like shortness of breath, it’s always best to seek professional medical advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts will continue to closely monitor the virus, including this new variant. In a recent piece for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/theres-a-new-covid-variant-driving-up-infections-a-virologist-explains-what-to-know-about-nb-1-8-1-257552" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, virologist Lara Herrero from Griffith University said there’s some evidence to suggest that Nimbus can spread more easily than earlier variants, but no reason to think it will cause more severe disease overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its spread has been identified in around 22 countries,” GP Dr Naveed Asif told the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/covid-strain-2025-new-variant-symptoms-uk-b2767036.html" target="_blank"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;, so it is definitely making the rounds. The &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/cases" target="_blank"&gt;latest data from the WHO&lt;/a&gt; at time of writing did show a global increase in cases compared to the previous 28-day period, but we’re still nowhere near the peak of the pandemic before &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/covid-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we’re all old hands at dealing with COVID now, right? Not that we don’t miss the Before Times… so here’s a little gift straight from 2019: scientists once trained rats to play hide and seek, and it made them &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/scientists-taught-rats-to-play-hide-and-seek-and-it-literally-made-them-jump-for-joy-53665" target="_blank"&gt;literally jump for joy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;The content of this article is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Now, a global phase 3 clinical trial has offered the strongest evidence yet. Spanning over a decade and involving nearly 900 patients across six countries, this study focused on colon cancer patients who had completed surgery and chemotherapy. The findings? A structured exercise programme doesn't just help in healing, it may actually tilt the scales in favour of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise can beat cancer: But what’s the truth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a growing belief that physical activity might help in preventing cancer or at least reduce its recurrence. While past studies only hinted at this link, this new phase 3 trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms it with rigorous data. Patients in the trial who followed a structured exercise routine for three years after chemotherapy saw a 28% lower risk of cancer recurrence and a 37% reduction in overall risk of death, compared to those who only received health advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just another wellness trend—it’s real science changing the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It’s triggering a series of deeply biological responses: boosting metabolism, encouraging beneficial gut bacteria, and repairing the gut lining. This is crucial because a healthy gut barrier helps stop cancer-promoting substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise increases the demand for glucose in muscles and organs, which leaves less fuel for potential tumour cells to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also regulates insulin levels, which, when too high, are linked to several cancers including colon, breast and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than movement: Exercise as an immune ally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond metabolism, exercise plays another vital role—it strengthens the immune system’s surveillance ability. This means it helps the body spot and destroy rogue cells that could turn cancerous. Think of it as constantly updating the body’s internal security system. Over time, this vigilance can lower the chance of relapse or even new cancers forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

While new medications often get approved for much smaller benefits (and come with toxicity risks), exercise delivered significant survival improvements with relatively mild side effects, mainly muscle-related issues in around 18% of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean exercise can replace drugs, but it can be a game-changing partner. Together, they make a more hostile environment for cancer to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Early Detection Saves Lives: Watch for These Ovarian Cancer Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building a routine that works&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured movement isn’t a one-size-fits-all. For cancer survivors, personalised programmes should be designed by health professionals and adjusted gently over time. A blend of 150 minutes per week of aerobic and strength training, like walking, cycling, or light resistance workouts, is a good goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a family history of colon cancer, regular physical activity, reduced red meat intake, a fibre-rich diet, and early screenings are essential.

              &lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions that doctors treating colon cancer get is: "What else can I do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since colon cancer starts in the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;digestive&lt;/a&gt; tract, the food we put in our bodies is — rightly or wrongly — one of the first places people look, wondering: Is there some food I can eat that will help fight cancer, or some cancer-causing thing I should eliminate from my diet, stat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that how cancer emerges inside a body is quite complex. There isn't usually one single thing a person can do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attending the world's biggest cancer conference earlier this month, I figured I'd cut through some of the noise out there and ask top colon cancer doctors directly what they generally recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone who specializes in gastrointestinal cancers, says his patients are often hunting for a winning &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/foods-that-boost-brain-health-neuro-nine-list-plants-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;superfood&lt;/a&gt; that can combat colon cancer. He fields questions routinely about the merits of avocados, pine nuts, and other items. Could adding those single items to the grocery cart help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he says he's "doubtful" any single food can really make the difference in cancer recurrence, there are a few well-trodden truths doctors live by. These are backed by reams of study data from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4b94983b-ebb1-4a5c-9746-781a8777426c" data-toc-id="4b94983b-ebb1-4a5c-9746-781a8777426c"&gt;Colon cancer doctors shun the meats and the sweets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still can't say for sure whether there's one specific diet that is best to combat cancer, and especially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greek-doctor-how-to-eat-for-health-longevity-on-budget-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;one diet that's best for you&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, people with seemingly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;"clean" diets do get digestive cancers&lt;/a&gt;, even in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, these four foods are consistently included in diets that seem to lead to cancer diagnoses later on, so oncologists warn against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="c5be940f-0623-4581-bc7f-9e23ce7f73a1" data-toc-id="c5be940f-0623-4581-bc7f-9e23ce7f73a1"&gt;Red meat&lt;/h3&gt;

He's not really comfortable getting that granular with his advice, based on the data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't have the quantification and the confidence to say it's either for sure going to help, or you can't have it ever," he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietician Lindsey Wohlford from MD Anderson Cancer Center created a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/your-guide-to-eating-less-red-meat.h26Z1590624.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;chart in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that recommends eating no more than two softballs' worth (18 oz.) of red meat per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="4dff9951-7086-47c9-8cb9-a99d7aa188f4" data-toc-id="4dff9951-7086-47c9-8cb9-a99d7aa188f4"&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juice and syrupy drinks&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It's common knowledge in the medical community that over-consumption of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sugar-coffee-soda-could-be-linked-to-early-death-2019-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sugar-sweetened beverages&lt;/a&gt; — including fruit juices, flavored coffees, and soda — can sharply up a person's risk of all kinds of diseases, from diabetes to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks are more potent than sweet foods because liquid sugar is absorbed very fast — sometimes too fast. It can saturate the small intestine, spilling excess sugar into the colon.

She said it's not exactly a new idea that sugar can drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's even data in animal models that fructose can lead to polyps," Cercek told BI. Her latest find opens up new questions about what might be prompting more aggressive cases of young colon cancer. "Is sugar maybe somehow driving and accelerating this process?" Cercek asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="852478cb-bf83-46cd-a33f-05b5ef838cfa" data-toc-id="852478cb-bf83-46cd-a33f-05b5ef838cfa"&gt;Alcohol — especially binge drinking and drinking on an empty stomach&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In a very basic sense, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-affects-your-brain-body-cancer-new-science-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is just fermented sugar, and it seems to carry a lot of the same cancer risks. Additionally, our liver breaks down alcohol into acetaldehyde, a known cancer-causing chemical that can damage DNA. Finally, alcohol dampens nutrient absorption and can kill off good bacteria in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In study after study, alcohol consumption is linked to more colon cancer diagnoses, and in general the more you drink, the greater your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests there might be something especially harmful about binge drinking or drinking on an empty stomach, when it comes to colon cancer. Most cancer doctors are not going to insist you can't enjoy a glass of wine or beer now and then, but they would probably say it's best to have it with a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1835dd34-a7e4-4192-a4f7-8e192acd04c8" data-toc-id="1835dd34-a7e4-4192-a4f7-8e192acd04c8"&gt;Colon cancer doctors love greens and a morning cuppa Joe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling hopeless now, buck up!

            &lt;p&gt;Fiber has a reputation for being great at keeping folks full and regular. But that's not all that it does. It also picks up debris in your gut, helping clear out the junk, and dropping off good guy bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why Dr. Pashtoon Kasi, a medical oncologist at City of Hope who specializes in GI cancers, said it's "not just fiber for fiber's sake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says it's underappreciated how fiber is "ameliorating or modulating the microbiome" in ways that may help prevent cancer in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="83a93601-d732-401c-b610-278b571dc9cd" data-toc-id="83a93601-d732-401c-b610-278b571dc9cd"&gt;Coffee (without sugar)&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;"Coffee comes up in every study," Oberstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great news for him personally, because he runs on the stuff. (But he says you don't need to feel pressured to start drinking coffee if you don't enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be something deeply beneficial about the anti-inflammatory properties of coffee. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/should-drink-coffee-prevent-colorectal-cancer" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that coffee isn't just good at preventing colon cancer (in one study, coffee drinkers had roughly 26% lower odds of contracting colon cancer) — people with colon cancer diagnoses who drink several cups of coffee a day also lower their odds of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="aa70bb29-1cd0-4d15-a71c-55ffd591081f" data-toc-id="aa70bb29-1cd0-4d15-a71c-55ffd591081f"&gt;The takeaway: add veggies and beans in where you can&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for more widespread dietary advice, the National Comprehensive Cancer Care network guidelines for colon cancer patients recommend sticking to a "low glycemic load" diet, which means choosing more foods that are slow to digest and pack a fiber-rich punch. Low-glycemic foods include all kinds of fruits, veggies, nuts, beans, and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber, where she is the founding director of the young-onset colorectal cancer center, says her recommendations fit this basic framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A diet less in red meat and processed foods and more in healthy proteins and fruits and vegetables is generally what we recommend," she told BI. "We know that that's typically anti-inflammatory and just healthier overall for a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;arly in his new book &lt;em&gt;These Strange New Minds&lt;/em&gt;, Oxford cognitive neuroscience professor and U.K. Google DeepMind AI researcher Chris Summerfield describes a classic cartoon scene in which Wile E. Coyote has just been led over a cliff by Road Runner, his legs churning for solid ground as he briefly hovers above the canyon below, moments from a catastrophic plunge. “I am writing this book because we have just gone over that cliff,” asserts Summerfield. “The safe ground we have left behind is a world where humans alone generate knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;Knowledge is, after all, power. It is what has enabled humans to build gleaming civilizations on Earth, to explore the reaches of our starry solar system, to dream up mind-bending artworks, and to grasp the material, cultural, and political dimensions of our everyday realities. As AIs become increasingly savvy at producing and acting on knowledge, what will they or those who control them do with it? In whose interest will they act, especially if AIs begin cooperating with one another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summerfield is, at least in the immediate future, less worried about the technology itself than about humans’ capacity to understand how it works and to interact with it intelligently. And this is, in part, the purpose of &lt;em&gt;These Strange New Minds&lt;/em&gt;: to help readers understand precisely how LLMs work, how they use language, and why the results look so much like human thought and speech. Over the course of the book, he takes us on a tour of the history of AI’s development—from its early philosophical underpinnings to its pop culture inspirations and impacts and explores our shifting ethics as it relates to these new minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Summerfield argues that LLMs are not sentient—at least not in any way humans can understand—that they’re unlikely to take over and destroy the world, but that they may well exacerbate existing problems. After all, AI’s limitations are not that dissimilar from those of the human brain, he says. We spoke with Summerfield about the limitations and risks of a technological revolution that is approaching so rapidly we’ve barely had time to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

Coyote, we have all just gone over a cliff in our relationship with AI. “The safe ground we have left behind is a world where humans alone generate knowledge.”&lt;em&gt; Photo by Catalina Renjifo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You use Wile E Coyote as a metaphor for the “cliff” we’ve run over in regard to AI. How did we get here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology hasn’t yet outrun our ability to control it, but this is the direction of travel. The metaphor refers to the unknowns associated with a new world in which AI systems can generate new knowledge—the first time an agent other than a human has been able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the significance of the language in large language models?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For humans, language is our superpower. Language is the critical cognitive advance that unlocked our ability to cooperate and collaborate and build an advanced civilization. Language allows us to share knowledge with each other, and to create new knowledge by combining ideas: Think of a horse with a horn—oh! A unicorn. So, the fact that AI has learned to talk is a really, really big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what extent does AI’s mastery of language give it some of the same super-powers as humans—such as the ability to cooperate and to share and create new knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperation requires more than just language—it requires the ability to infer the beliefs and preferences of others, and to adapt to the social world. We haven’t yet extensively tested situations where LLMs interact with each other, to understand what the consequences may be. Their ability to reason, however, gives AI systems the opportunity to create new ideas, by putting existing pieces of knowledge together in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do LLMs “understand” language or are they just good at acting like it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is we don’t have widely agreed definitions for what it means to “understand” something in the first place. Do you “understand” how a combustion engine works? Do you “understand” why World War II happened? We don’t have strong criteria for making hard and fast judgments like this. What we can say, however, is that LLMs’ formal competence in language, including in generating entirely novel utterances, is as good as or better than a human, at least for English and other well-resourced languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology hasn’t yet outrun our ability to control it, but this is the direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book you explore assertions that AI has become or will become conscious. How could AI consciousness impact society?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t think it would affect society at all, because we would never know whether it is conscious or not. When it comes to any agent other than ourselves, consciousness is very much in the eye of the beholder—I can’t experience your subjectivity, but if you display certain behaviors, I will treat you &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; you are conscious. We do this with our pets all the time. I expect that as AI becomes more humanlike, people will come to believe that it is conscious, but we won’t ever know for sure whether that is right or not.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will AI be a tool, or a new form of person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s more useful to think about AI as a tool, and in particular as a sort of digital service that we can use to make decisions on our behalf. People need to remember that when talking to AI they are not interacting with a person—they are using a service that is provided by a technology company. But if it behaves in humanlike ways, it will definitely be tempting to treat AI like a human. However, I am not convinced that what we need is more humans—we have 8 billion of them already. We need better tools for organizing society, so that we can live together more peacefully, prosperously, and equitably—variables that are in short supply right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can LLMs “think?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs carry out reasoning steps in natural language that resemble those that you and I might make when solving a problem. They can even say these steps to themselves out loud whilst they are reasoning, and—just like for you and me—this improves their chances of finding a good solution. But we haven’t really clearly defined what it means for a human to “think” so there will always be room for some people to claim that what AI systems are doing does not count as “thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book you push back against the idea that the use of the word “computation” as a metaphor for human thinking is somehow socially oppressive. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have argued that if we use the metaphor that the brain computes information, we are somehow lowering people to the level of computers, and that this is intrinsically harmful. I agree that it’s important for us to maintain a notion of human “difference”—we have our own concerns, and they should be treasured—but I think the general idea that it’s oppressive to use computation as a metaphor for the brain is a bit silly. It’s just a useful way of thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to remember that when talking to AI they are not interacting with a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You discuss the risks posed by AI “autopropaganda.” How would this differ from the digital misinformation we’re facing today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algorithms embedded in content recommendation systems, such as social media platforms, already ensure that we view “autopropaganda”—propaganda for the views we already hold, i.e. that confirms our existing beliefs. If AI became highly personalized, there is a risk that it could behave similarly, only telling you what you want to hear. The difference would be that AI systems can actively engage with you in persuasive dialogue, so the effect risks being much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people envision a near future where AI solves the looming issues of the day, but as you discuss in the book, this expectation may be misplaced. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is very good at retrieving knowledge and reasoning about formal problems, but many of the issues that we face today require a different sort of skill—the ability to bring people together to cooperate. We have yet to see much evidence that AI is good at this—although there have been some early attempts, including one that I &lt;a href="http://habermas.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; at Deepmind. [A study on whether AI can function as a political mediator.] The ability to solve formal problems, like playing Go at Grandmaster level or solving logic puzzles, does not necessarily equip you for the real world, where things tend to be quite messy. Outcomes are uncertain—stochastic rather than deterministic—and challenges can arise without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You close the book by exploring some of the potential AI doomsday scenarios. What worries you the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of AI is likely to exacerbate systemic problems that already exist, such as disruption to the labor market from growing automation, the concentration of capital in the hands of large multinational companies, the spread of mis/disinformation in the information ecosystem, the use of cyber technologies for criminal or destabilizing attacks on critical infrastructure, and the environmental costs of intensive demand for energy, water, and rare earth minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am worried about what will happen when AI systems begin to interact with each other. As humans, we are not all that smart on our own. You might think you are smarter than a chimp, but if I stranded you both on a desert island, my money is on the chimp surviving longer. We are good at cooperating, and our intelligence is enabled by our social world. When agents start to interact, they will naturally find modes of acting and communicating that may be misaligned with human values. This is what worries me most! &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: cybermagician / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="fragment-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For years, people only really thought about their liver when they were drinking too much or when a doctor brought up scary stuff like hepatitis. But now? Everyone’s talking about fatty liver, detoxing, enzyme levels, and all things liver-related—and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is quietly becoming a global epidemic. You don’t need to be a drinker to have liver issues anymore—junk food, sugar, sedentary lifestyle, and even stress can mess it up. And most people don’t even realize they have a problem until it's advanced. Secondly, your liver is your body’s main detox organ. It filters out all the stuff you throw at it—alcohol, meds, pollutants, processed foods, you name it. So if your liver isn’t in top shape, neither are you. From hormonal imbalances to acne to chronic fatigue—yep, your liver might be the culprit. Also, the rise in fitness culture and functional medicine is making people think beyond just abs and protein shakes. Now, it's about feeling good inside out—and that means showing some love to the organ that quietly keeps you alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr Saurabh Sethi, who is very popular on social media shared how liver diseases progress. Not just this, the doctor shared two ways to keep the liver healthy. Dr Sethi explains how a liver disease progresses from simple fatty liver disease to inflammation and cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, Dr Sethi recommends two ways to keep the liver healthy: reducing alcohol consumption and staying metabolically healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want a healthy liver? Cut the booze and fix that metabolic mess&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about that one organ that works harder than your boss and rarely gets credit: your liver. It’s your body’s detox machine, fuel processor, fat regulator, and overall superhero. And guess what? It’s under attack—every single day—especially if you’re living on a diet of fries, sugar, zero movement, and weekend binge-drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, two big villains in this story? Alcohol and poor metabolic health. But the good news? You have more control than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, alcohol. We all know heavy drinking can wreck your liver. But what a lot of people don’t realize is that even moderate drinking, when done regularly, can sneakily damage your liver over time. The liver breaks down alcohol, and in the process, it produces toxic byproducts like acetaldehyde. That stuff is no joke—it inflames your liver and triggers scarring. Over time, this can lead to fatty liver, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis. The scary part? Most of this happens quietly, without symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back—or quitting altogether—gives your liver breathing room to heal. Yes, your liver can actually regenerate, but only if you stop beating it up with round after round of alcohol. Even cutting down to a few drinks a week instead of daily can make a huge difference. Think of it like giving your liver a break from overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s metabolic health. Your liver doesn’t just suffer when you drink—it also takes a hit when your blood sugar is out of whack, you’re gaining belly fat, or you’re insulin-resistant. That’s what we call poor metabolic health, and it’s become the new silent killer. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now one of the most common liver problems worldwide, and yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like: fat accumulating in your liver even if you don’t drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because your liver plays a major role in processing sugar and fat. So when your body is constantly dealing with high blood sugar levels (hello, processed carbs and sodas), it stores the excess as fat—including in the liver. Add in low physical activity and weight gain around the waist, and you’ve got a recipe for liver overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what can you do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut the sugar. Move more. Eat more whole foods. Get better sleep. Keep your weight in check. Basically, if you clean up your lifestyle—even just a little—your liver responds fast. Drop 5–10% of your body weight and your fatty liver risk drops too. Start walking daily, and your insulin levels improve. Get better sleep and inflammation goes down.

However, measuring intrinsic capacity has, until now, required sophisticated equipment and trained personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that measuring &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2012112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in blood samples to assess intrinsic capacity effectively predicts all-cause mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which is published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00883-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, suggests that the IC clock could be a useful tool for tracking aging and guiding targeted interventions to maintain function in older age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M. Holland&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in this study, commented for &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A blood- or saliva-based test for intrinsic capacity, known as DNAm IC, is a very promising tool in aging science. […] This test uses DNA methylation patterns, chemical tags that regulate gene activity, to estimate your IC biologically, offering insights into how well your body is functioning compared to your chronological age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most critical aspects is that this test can be done with a simple blood or saliva sample, making it accessible and noninvasive. It tells us not just how old you are, but how well you are aging, which is much more meaningful to help inform which interventions should be implemented, if any, to help prevent future health problems,” Holland explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthmiro.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Elena Rolt&lt;/a&gt;, MSc, DipION, IFMCP, a Registered Nutritional Therapist and Functional Medicine Practitioner and cofounder of Health Miro, who was not involved in this research, also welcomed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DNA methylation-based intrinsic capacity (DNAm IC) test shows significant potential as a practical measure of biological aging,“ Rolt told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. “Unlike traditional epigenetic clock based tests, it also captures functional aging more directly.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As it reflects immune aging, physical capacity and lifestyle-related risk factors, this test may be particularly relevant for personalised aging interventions and preventive strategies,” she added.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However,” Rolt cautioned, “its use should be complementary to other markers — e.g. PhenoAge, GrimAge, functional tests — and its utility in clinical practice will depend on further validation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from 1,014 people from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7352084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;INSPIRE-T cohort&lt;/a&gt;, aged between 20 and 102 years, the researchers developed an IC score using five aspects of age-related decline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;cognition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;locomotion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sensory (vision and hearing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;psychological&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From blood and saliva tests, the researchers collected data on &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2012112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; — a process that activates or deactivates genes.

People with the highest DNAm IC had better lung function, faster walking speed, greater bone mineral density and were more likely to view themselves as healthy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people with a high DNAm IC lived, on average, 5.5 years longer than those with a low DNAm IC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told us this was a very significant finding: “Scientifically, this reflects strong associations between high IC and better immune function, lower chronic inflammation, and reduced risk for diseases like hypertension, heart failure, stroke, and other age-related conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Simply,” he added, “if your body is functioning well internally you are more likely to live longer and stay healthier. This test doesn’t just give a snapshot of your current state; it may also offer a glimpse into your future health.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In everyone, intrinsic capacity declines with age, but there are measures that can help to slow that decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that people with a high dietary intake of oily fish, and sugar intake that was within recommended guidelines (no more than 5% of total energy intake), were more likely to have a high DNAm IC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://london-regenerative.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Tunç Tiryaki&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of the London Regenerative Institute, who was not involved in the recent study, explained the association:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oily fish are rich in long-chain &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; (EPA and DHA), which have anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and mitochondrial-supportive properties. These mechanisms are closely aligned with domains of IC such as vitality and cognitive function. &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/omega-3-what-it-can-and-cant-do-for-health" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; also modulate gene expression related to immune responses and cellular senescence, pathways shown to be enriched in the DNAm IC signature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conversely, excessive sugar intake is known to accelerate glycation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, all of which impair IC,” Tiryaki told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying within recommended sugar limits likely supports metabolic flexibility and reduces inflammatory burden, preserving cognitive and physical function. These dietary factors likely influence DNAm IC by modulating epigenetic regulation and immune aging, thus helping maintain functional capacity,“ he detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland, Tiryaki, and Rolt recommended a number of measures to help ensure healthy aging. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;following a healthy diet, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mind-diet" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MIND&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; diet, that is rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, and healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, olive oil and oily fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;regular physical activity, including aerobic activity, strength training and balance exercises; Tiryaki emphasized that physical activity “supports locomotion and vitality and influences mitochondrial function and immune health, both of which are linked to IC”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cognitive and social engagement — keeping your brain stimulated and maintaining social networks are both associated with healthier aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ensuring that you manage stress and any chronic diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told us that the DNAm clock was a major advance in functional aging science: “It links molecular biology with real-world outcomes like mobility, cognition and lifespan. While further validation is needed, especially in older adults with low IC, this study lays the groundwork for using personalised epigenetic markers to guide interventions in preventive geriatrics, longevity medicine and precision public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DNAm IC reflects not only how long you might live, but how well you might function, and that shift in focus is central to meaningful longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Thomas M.

			&lt;p&gt;You may have come across those "what I eat in a day" videos on social media, where people – usually conventionally attractive influencers wearing activewear – list everything they consumed that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might seem like harmless fun but in fact they can reinforce dangerous ideas about food, weight and body image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've worked with people with eating disorders who watch these videos and have seen first hand how harmful this content can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the research says and what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Videos that promote 'health' can be unhealthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I eat in a day" videos have been popular for over a decade, with views reaching in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;billions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They target both men and women and many claim to promote health and nutrition. Yet videos such as these can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few of these creators have formal &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2023.2260966#d1e678"&gt;qualifications&lt;/a&gt; in health or nutrition, increasing the potential for &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14407833231161369"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;depict&lt;/a&gt; low calorie diets, exclude entire food groups or promote "clean eating" (a problematic idea at best).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;encourage dangerous behaviours&lt;/a&gt; such as skipping meals, eating very little or using laxatives to purge food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also send harmful messages about body image. Many such videos use &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;beauty filters&lt;/a&gt; to create images promoting unrealistic body ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These videos often feature shots of how the person looks from the front, the side, in the gym, and in tight, form-fitting clothes. There may even be some "before and after" weight loss pics, sending the harmful message this should be everyone's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subtext is clear: "eat what I eat in a day and you can look like me".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164412" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164412" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day_642.jpg" alt="fit person in the kitchen" class="wp-image-164412 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164412" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The subtext is clear. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEdJM5ELfk/"&gt;alphaspirit.it/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not just a dangerous idea – it's a totally false and erroneous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what a certain person "eats in a day" doesn't mean you'll look like them if you follow their lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a 24-hour rundown of one person's food intake doesn't even provide accurate information about that person's nutritional health – let alone yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You are not them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like our health, our nutritional needs are unique to us and can vary day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What constitutes a "healthy" choice for one person might be totally different for another depending on things such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links between health and diet are best examined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35475441/"&gt;over time&lt;/a&gt;, not in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basing our food intake on a brief snapshot of what someone else eats is unlikely to lead to better health. It might leave you worse off overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 ways these videos can affect mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we watch online can affect our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02673843.2019.1590851"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, behaviour and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.12581"&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells should ring if you frequently see these videos and notice you're doing or experiencing these five things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Disordered eating. Eating less than your body needs, skipping meals, cutting out entire food groups, binge eating and purging are all signs of disordered eating that can lead to serious mental health problems such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10082698/"&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Low mood. Watching videos promoting low-calorie diets can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144524000342?via%3Dihub"&gt;worsen&lt;/a&gt; our mood; you might find yourself feeling deflated after &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144524000342?via%3Dihub"&gt;comparing&lt;/a&gt; yourself to others (or rather, to the version of themselves they promote online)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Poor body image. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144524000342?via%3Dihub"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows watching "what I eat in a day" videos can leave people feeling worse about their bodies and appreciating them less&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Obsessive thinking and anxiety. Obsessing over the "perfect" diet can increase &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40519-021-01110-x"&gt;anxiety about food&lt;/a&gt; and eating. Diets that encourage a very detailed approach to nutrition – including breaking meals down into components such as carbohydrates and proteins or weighing food – can further fuel obsessive thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Narrow life focus. Having your social media feed filled with these types of videos can create an overemphasis on the importance of food, eating and body image on your self-worth. This ultimately affects your health and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12711261/"&gt;wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164415" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164415" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day2_642.jpg" alt="teen boy on phone" class="wp-image-164415 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day2_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164415" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Food videos often target young men and women, affecting health and wellbeing. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAED_vl7rlI/"&gt;Vesnaandjic/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OK, so what can I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're encountering "what I eat in a day" videos often and find they're affecting your mood, eating behaviour or sense of self-worth you can try to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that these videos are not tailored to your individual health or nutritional needs and that many contain harmful messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid engaging with videos that promote disordered eating, idealised beauty standards or that make you feel bad after you watch them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unfollow accounts that regularly post such videos, or tap "not interested" on the TikTok video to stop the algorithm showing you more of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance your social media feed with content focused on other areas of life besides food and eating (such as art, design, animals, books, sports or travel). Fill your feed with interests that improve your personal sense of wellbeing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider taking regular breaks from social media and seeing if you feel better overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do want to view posts about food, seek out creators attempting to buck these negative trends by focusing more on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;fun and taste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're experiencing low mood, disordered eating or body image issues, seek help from your local GP. They can connect you with practitioners who provide evidence-based therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.aacbt.org.au/cbt-information/#WhatIsCBT"&gt;cognitive behavioural therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a history of an eating disorder or suspect you may have one, you can contact the &lt;a href="https://butterfly.org.au/"&gt;Butterfly Foundation's national helpline&lt;/a&gt; on 1800 334 673 (or via their online chat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, "what I eat in a day" videos aren't really helpful. They contain very little useful information to guide your health or nutritional goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are considering making changes to your diet, it's important to consult a qualified professional, such as an accredited practising dietitian, who can learn about your situation and monitor any risks.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257127/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Marginalized populations, including women and girls, may suffer disproportionately from increased prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by snail-carried worms. Infection typically starts with making contact with the worms in freshwater, such as in a canal, river, or pond. Person-to-person transmission can continue when urine or feces containing the parasite's eggs contaminates a water source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms — including fever, chills, coughing, and aches — can manifest within a couple of months, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Chronic infections can lead to anemia, bloody stools, urinary problems, organ damage, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Historically, 90% of the schistosomiasis cases requiring treatment have been located in Africa, but infections have also been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/about/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,water%20that%20contains%20these%20snails." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:documented;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East. While the London-based outlet has &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more recent spreading in parts of Europe may be largely tourism- and migration-driven, researcher Bonnie Webster also told the publication that transmissions may emerge in further locations due to shifting weather patterns. Rising global temperatures are driving more frequent and more intense flooding events, causing snails to appear in new wet settings and increasing water contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Climate change will likely cause dramatic changes in transmission which need to be understood," Webster, who studies the disease at London's Natural History Museum, &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Telegraph. "Some areas will become drier and other areas will become flooded, creating new water bodies. This will lead to snails changing where they can be found and cause the prevalence of schistosomiasis to increase and spread, leading to outbreaks in new locations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Communities in low- and middle-income countries lacking sufficient sanitation infrastructure are already disproportionately impacted by this serious issue, and women and girls are additionally vulnerable to its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the parasite's spread concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All people can become infected by these parasites, but one manifestation of the disease — female genital schistosomiasis, or FGS — can cause sexual, reproductive, and other health concerns for women and girls. Gendered labor dynamics can make this group additionally susceptible to infection through activities like washing laundry in contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlimit Health &lt;a href="https://unlimithealth.org/ntds/female-genital-schistosomiasis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that around 56 million women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with FGS, which can go undiagnosed and, especially when misdiagnosed as a sexually transmitted infection or otherwise left untreated, can lead to bleeding, pelvic pain, ulcers, miscarriage, and infertility. It may also contribute to increased risks of HIV and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250412/New-study-connects-parasitic-disease-to-genetic-changes-in-the-cervical-lining.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cervical cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, schistosomiasis impacts hundreds of millions of people each year, resulting in up to 20,000 deaths annually, &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, as Webster &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, "Once one snail is infected, they can infect a whole population of humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done to help?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While treatments exist, potential drug resistance and current medical shortages could hamper attempts to curtail infections.

Of course, because of travel and climate change, many such infections may spread to more communities and farther regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:notes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that prevention includes clean-up of contaminated areas, implementation of sanitation systems, and avoiding swimming, wading, and washing in unsafe water.

							&lt;p&gt;I was sitting with my morning coffee in Singapore, scrolling through Instagram DMs, when something stopped me cold. A few days earlier, I'd published &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/news/j-the-unexpected-mental-health-consequences-of-veganism-according-to-medical-research/"&gt;an article about the research showing vegans have significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. I expected pushback from the vegan community. What I didn't expect was this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not even vegan," read one message, "but your article made me realize why I've been so miserable since starting CrossFit. I can't admit to my gym friends that I'm burned out because being 'the fitness guy' is all I have left."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another: "I've been calling myself a minimalist for three years, but I'm secretly drowning in anxiety about whether I own too much. I can't buy anything without feeling like I'm betraying who I am."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this one, which made me set my phone down entirely: "I left my corporate job to become a 'conscious entrepreneur' and now I'm more trapped than ever. I can't pivot my failing business because everyone knows me as the guy who escaped the rat race. What happens to my identity if I go back?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something clicked. This wasn't about veganism at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages kept coming—dozens of them—from people who'd never touched a plant-based diet but recognized something in &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/j-i-wrote-about-veganism-and-mental-health-and-was-stunned-by-how-many-people-are-suffering-in-silence/"&gt;my follow-up piece about the psychological cost of living by strict ethical codes&lt;/a&gt;. Christians questioning their faith but terrified to lose their community. Democrats who disagreed with party positions but couldn't voice dissent. Parents suffocating under the weight of attachment parenting philosophies they'd adopted as gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I was looking at the hidden epidemic of our time: a generation of people who've confused temporary alignments with permanent essence, mistaking belief systems for identity itself. And it's quietly destroying us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my decade of work with &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io"&gt;The Vessel&lt;/a&gt;—the platform I co-founded to help people develop authentic self-knowledge—I'd seen glimpses of this pattern. But it took those Instagram messages to show me how universal it really is. We've become a society of ideological orphans, desperately adopting belief systems as surrogate families, then defending them with the fierce loyalty of abandoned children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental health crisis among vegans isn't about B12 deficiencies or social pressure. It's about what happens when any beautiful choice becomes a psychological prison. And once you see this pattern, you can't unsee it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're living through the collapse of traditional meaning-making structures—religion, extended family, stable communities, geographical rootedness. But instead of grieving this loss and building something new, we've been frantically grabbing onto ideologies like life rafts, then clinging to them so tightly we forget we know how to swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about my friend Sarah, a brilliant lawyer who became vegan after watching a documentary about factory farming. Within six months, she wasn't just someone who ate plants—she *was* vegan. When she started experiencing digestive issues and brain fog, she couldn't bring herself to try eliminating certain foods because that felt like betraying not just animals, but herself. "If I'm not vegan," she asked me, "then who am I?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question haunts me because I've asked variations of it myself. When I &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/i-thought-id-escaped-the-corporate-grind-heres-the-sobering-truth-i-learned-about-the-hidden-system-that-traps-us-all/"&gt;left my corporate career to build conscious businesses&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I was choosing freedom. But I'd just traded one identity prison for another. I became so invested in being "the guy who escaped the system" that I couldn't honestly assess when my new ventures weren't working. Admitting failure felt like admitting I was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what psychologists call "identity fusion"—when the boundary between self and group dissolves, when challenging the belief feels like threatening the self. It creates a kind of anxious attachment where any flexibility feels like existential danger. You can't be wrong about anything significant because being wrong means you might not be who you think you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing this everywhere in my work. The meditation teacher who couldn't admit she was depressed because spiritual people are supposed to be at peace. The zero-waste advocate who hoarded glass jars in secret shame. The productivity guru whose life was chaos but couldn't say so without destroying his brand—and his sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I met Brazilian shaman Rudá Iandê in 2014, he helped me understand something crucial: most suffering comes not from our circumstances, but from our rigid identification with temporary states. We think we need to be consistent, to have a solid sense of self. But what if that very solidity is what's strangling us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Rudá to help him launch &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/sp/out-of-the-box/"&gt;programs like "Out of the Box"&lt;/a&gt; showed me that the people who suffer most are often the ones with the strongest moral convictions. They care so much about doing right that they lose touch with what actually serves their wellbeing. They become more committed to the purity of their positions than to the effectiveness of their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern isn't just creating individual misery—it's fracturing our collective ability to solve problems. When your identity depends on being "the environmentalist" or "the conservative" or "the progressive," you become psychologically invested in being right rather than getting things right. You can't adapt your strategies based on evidence because your strategies have become you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at our political discourse. People can't change their minds about anything significant without feeling like they're committing intellectual suicide. Climate activists can't acknowledge when certain approaches aren't working. Business leaders can't pivot failing strategies. Parents can't adjust philosophies that aren't serving their families. &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/jus-10-signs-of-a-truly-independent-thinker-according-to-psychology/"&gt;We've lost the capacity for independent thinking&lt;/a&gt; because we've confused intellectual positions with personal essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call it "fluid integrity"—the capacity to hold your values deeply enough that you're not blown around by every cultural wind, yet lightly enough that you can evolve them without losing yourself. It means understanding that you are the space in which beliefs arise and pass away, not the beliefs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone with fluid integrity might remain deeply committed to reducing animal suffering while being honest about personal health struggles. They might care passionately about environmental protection while being willing to question which specific approaches work best. They hold their convictions as tools for engaging with reality, not as monuments to their moral worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about becoming wishy-washy or abandoning your principles. It's about recognizing the difference between commitment and attachment. Commitment serves your values; attachment serves your ego's need for certainty. Commitment adapts to circumstances; attachment defends against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about Marcus, a guy who reached out after reading my veganism piece. He'd been plant-based for five years and loved it—until he developed severe anemia that wasn't responding to supplementation. Instead of quietly adding animal products and suffering in shame, he posted honestly in his vegan community about needing to temporarily include some fish for his health. "I'm still committed to minimizing animal suffering," he wrote, "and right now that includes not sacrificing my own wellbeing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half the group attacked him. But the other half thanked him for his honesty, and several admitted they'd been struggling with similar issues in silence. That's what fluid integrity looks like: &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/jus-7-ways-to-tell-if-someone-forms-their-own-opinions-or-just-repeats-what-theyve-heard-elsewhere/"&gt;the courage to prioritize truth over tribal belonging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice starts with a simple recognition: every identity you cling to is provisional. "I am vegan" becomes "I currently choose plant-based eating because it aligns with my values." "I am an entrepreneur" becomes "I am currently building a business as one expression of my creativity." "I am spiritual" becomes "I am currently exploring practices that deepen my sense of connection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't semantic game-playing. It's psychological freedom. When you hold your identities lightly, you can respond to life as it unfolds rather than defending against it. You can be wrong without being worthless. You can change without losing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that people with fluid integrity often become more principled, not less. When your principles serve your growth rather than constraining it, they become more powerful tools for engagement. When you're not defending your beliefs, you can actually live them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch this transformation in people who go through our programs at The Vessel. They don't become less passionate or committed. They become more creative, more resilient, more effective. They stop fighting against reality and start dancing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at those Instagram messages, I realize they were all variations of the same cry: "I thought this identity would save me, but it's suffocating me instead." Veganism, fitness culture, political movements, spiritual practices, career paths—we've turned them all into identity prisons because we're terrified of the space between who we were and who we're becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that space isn't empty. It's where growth happens. It's where real choice lives. It's where you remember that you are not your beliefs—you are the awareness that chooses them, questions them, and when necessary, transcends them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental health crisis among vegans is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath it lies a fundamental confusion about the nature of identity in the modern world. We've been taught to build ourselves out of beliefs, positions, and practices. But we are the builders, not the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world that profits from our psychological rigidity, fluid integrity is a radical act. It's the foundation of both personal freedom and collective wisdom. And it might just be the key to solving problems that rigid ideologies never could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you feel that familiar anxiety about whether you're being consistent enough, pure enough, committed enough to whatever identity you've adopted, try asking a different question: "What would serve my growth right now?" The answer might surprise you. And that surprise might be exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study from researchers at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia says that vitamin D supplements might actually slow down biological aging. Yes, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, focused on telomeres—tiny protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes. As we age, these tips wear down, which is linked to age-related diseases like heart problems, certain cancers, and more. The shorter the telomeres, the more worn out your cells are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, here’s where it gets cool: Researchers looked at data from the well-known VITAL study—a long-term clinical trial where participants were randomly given either vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day), omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day), or a placebo. The telomere sub-study followed over 1,000 people (women 55+ and men 50+) for up to four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results? Those taking vitamin D had significantly less telomere shortening compared to those on placebo. In fact, vitamin D slowed the rate of cellular aging by what would’ve been the equivalent of nearly three years! That’s a pretty big deal when you're trying to keep your cells (and yourself) feeling young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s, on the other hand, didn’t seem to make much of a difference in this case—at least not for telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is always welcome, this study adds to growing evidence that vitamin D does more than just support your bones and immunity. It may also be quietly working behind the scenes to keep your cells younger, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, the principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health at Harvard Medical School. “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease,” said Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is one of those nutrients that quietly does a ton of important stuff in your body—and most of us don’t even realize we’re running low on it. Nicknamed the “sunshine vitamin” because your body makes it when sunlight hits your skin, vitamin D helps your bones stay strong by making sure you absorb enough calcium. Without it, your bones can get weak, brittle, and way more prone to breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s just the beginning. Vitamin D also supports your immune system—so you're better equipped to fight off colds, flu, and even chronic inflammation. Some studies say it may help improve your mood, too, and there’s growing research linking low vitamin D to issues like depression, fatigue, and brain fog. The catch? A lot of us don’t get enough sun, especially if we’re indoors all day or live in cloudy places. That’s where food and supplements come in—fatty fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, or a daily D3 capsule can help fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t ghost your vitamin D. So if you’ve been slacking on your vitamin D intake (especially if you're not getting much sun), this might be the nudge you needed to start adding it to your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 02:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxQc2NqdGpOc0pacm83LVRhMGZ4ck9zWm5TNW5RdWM3U0QzSGZHVy1DZjhUaVFGeWZVZng0V0hiemlTOUxGMVVJT092OG9fczVCSVdqTDRwRjJXeWhoNUJaTWd5SDA4OUtfV0trUXR6OTFhUXl4RngwZHFraXpORzBFemNIbW4wOVBkY1Fyek80c2phalozWE1SYzIxY1g2TGJORVV0RDRqdXVUMUFfYWZKaS11ZGlFeV9RRS1ZR0QtNXJzOHZGN2xyQjFuZXotUnpEV2k3UVM1M1JYWlBjQWM4Y2ZYeUN3cVB3S3ZDejF3</guid></item><item><title>长寿的人分享非常重要的血液生物标志物，为科学家提供抗衰老提示- Earth.com | Long-lived people share very crucial blood biomarkers, giving scientists anti-aging hints - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOT19qNDRjX2hwLXk3bnBPWjdGUWppZG1HQkxXNkh4ZFNRTTZFdEJ5ZFNXSkZyTjBFaDNUb3dFVDFnYlpoaTJBb1B6ellNMWtnSW9LNWxHMk1HQk1YM2JPNHdPS2Z5Q2ZpX2xZelJRSGZoVmtuRmNwb0JocVpqeHZTZFlweGVwNWIyM0NDckZCaWRXXzBhRnQ0dTJzZlVkRVgzdHoyYUQtenFTd1NwT0NPdFRVdlZHS0Jrb1JLVU1nQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few generations, the idea of celebrating a 100th birthday has moved from fairy-tale territory to neighborhood reality. Centenarians are now the fastest-growing age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their ranks have doubled roughly every ten years since 1950, and projections point to a fivefold jump between 2022 and 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those soaring numbers spark a simple question: why do some bodies last so much longer than others? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers keep circling back to the familiar duet of genetics and daily habits – food, activity, stress management – but the details are still fuzzy enough to make any doctor shrug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-for-common-threads"&gt;Looking for common threads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That puzzle motivated a team at &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt;, writing in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;, to follow 44,000 Swedes aged 64–99 whose blood had been tested decades ago in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28158674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AMORIS cohort&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them, 1,224 – about 2.7 percent – lived to 100, and a striking 85 percent of that group were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-anti-aging-drug-interleukin-11-boosts-lifespan-prevents-cancer-gray-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gray hair&lt;/a&gt; and walking sticks, these future centenarians were already standing out. Hospital stays were rarer, memory stayed sharper, and routine lab work hinted at bodies aging at a slower clip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exceptional longevity, it turns out, often traces back to midlife, not just the final lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharing-blood-biomarkers"&gt;Sharing blood biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors lean on “biomarkers” – chemical snapshots that reveal how hard organs are working. Inflammation markers often climb with age; in one Japanese study, people with the lowest inflammation were more likely to reach 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns keep popping up for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-power-of-fish-oil-in-combating-high-cholesterol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, and kidney-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing matters. Snapshots taken at a single clinic visit, known as a “cross-sectional study,” can’t untangle cause from consequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are good numbers protecting you, or are they simply the fingerprint of slower aging? Longitudinal records are needed to see which comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-invaluable-data-from-sweden"&gt;Invaluable data from Sweden&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because AMORIS records stretched back 35 years, the Karolinska group could watch trends instead of single frames. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They combed through twelve blood-based indicators tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-metabolism-has-evolved-to-become-energetically-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, liver and kidney function, nutrition, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fasting-helps-the-body-fight-inflammation-and-chronic-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future centenarians cruised through their sixties with lower glucose, creatinine, and uric acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme readings were rare: almost none logged a glucose level above 6.5 mmol/L or a creatinine value over 125 µmol/L. In plain terms, sugar control and kidney metrics stayed firmly in the middle lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-numbers-big-weight"&gt;Small numbers, big weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants were sorted into five groups for each biomarker, patterns starting popping out. Folks in the lowest bracket for total cholesterol and iron were less likely to hit 100 than those sitting midrange or higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, creeping levels of biomarkers like glucose, creatinine, uric acid, and several &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brushing-your-teeth-regularly-can-prevent-deadly-liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver enzymes&lt;/a&gt; quietly clipped the odds of joining the century club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003476.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uric acid&lt;/a&gt; told perhaps the clearest story. In the group with the most modest readings, 4 percent reached triple digits; in the highest group, only 1.5 percent did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gap of 2.5 percentage points may look small, yet across whole populations it translates to thousands of extra birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-paths-to-the-same-biomarkers"&gt;Different paths to the same biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies from Italy, Denmark, and Germany underline that not every centenarian walks the same path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some arrive at their milestone spry enough to garden all morning; others are frailer and juggling multiple health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish team now hopes to see whether those divergent futures were already written in the early bloodwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the split is more than academic. Public-health planners need to know how many elders will require intensive care versus those likely to stay independent, and families want clearer hints about what to expect in their own later chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-lifestyle-luck"&gt;Genes, lifestyle, luck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study cannot pin tidy lab values on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-benefits-of-the-mediterranean-diet-can-be-boosted-with-more-greens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kale salads&lt;/a&gt; or rare stretches of DNA. It does, however, underline that metabolism and organ health matter long before retirement parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family traits, food choices, alcohol habits, exercise, and plain chance all swirl together to shape those lab slips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observations from so-called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blue-zone-diets-reduce-the-risk-of-severe-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; – pockets such as Okinawa and Sardinia where nonagenarians crowd the village square – echo the Swedish findings: modest meals, steady activity, and low chronic inflammation often travel together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biomarkers-and-longevity-science"&gt;Biomarkers and longevity science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are gearing up to layer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meet-the-pangenome-the-clearest-snapshot-ever-taken-of-human-genomic-diversity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetic sequencing&lt;/a&gt; on top of old blood records, hunting for variants that might keep organs humming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models, trained on decades of biomarker data, could soon flag people at risk of a rougher aging course while there’s still plenty of time to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big picture, the goal is to shift medicine’s focus from chasing disease to stretching healthspan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If early lab signs can predict who will thrive into their nineties, doctors could use the information to tweak treatment targets decades ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-start-building-biomarkers-now"&gt;Start building biomarkers now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No blood test guarantees a telegram from the White House, yet keeping tabs on kidney and liver enzymes, fasting glucose, and uric acid as the years roll by can offer early warning lights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small tweaks – longer walks, fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;, varied protein, mindful stress relief – nudge those numbers toward the safer middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you find yourself blowing out 100 candles one June evening, remember that the path likely started long before AARP mailers first hit the doorstep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balanced metrics in midlife appear to set the stage for a longer, healthier encore that keeps both brain and body in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00936-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GeroScience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 02:16:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxOT19qNDRjX2hwLXk3bnBPWjdGUWppZG1HQkxXNkh4ZFNRTTZFdEJ5ZFNXSkZyTjBFaDNUb3dFVDFnYlpoaTJBb1B6ellNMWtnSW9LNWxHMk1HQk1YM2JPNHdPS2Z5Q2ZpX2xZelJRSGZoVmtuRmNwb0JocVpqeHZTZFlweGVwNWIyM0NDckZCaWRXXzBhRnQ0dTJzZlVkRVgzdHoyYUQtenFTd1NwT0NPdFRVdlZHS0Jrb1JLVU1nQQ</guid></item><item><title>黑客T细胞治疗乳糜泻- Hackaday | Hacking T Cells To Treat Celiac Disease - Hackaday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE50RHB5VnpEcUYxRjM3RkV5NmpsS0NvZ2pmYUV5LVVJSms3VFpZVUtDVVNMSmZlcDYyNEZCZm11ZE8tTmJRbGhVUER3bl9PMUl3dkxkTlRabUYyakxMQ1F6NGkwQWdFWGJCNFdfaFRGTTQyNEZZRDJLdnFPZ3I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" id="post-784914" class="post-784914 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-medical-hacks tag-autoimmune-disease tag-autoimmunity tag-disease tag-immune-system tag-medical-hacks"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As there is no cure for celiac disease, people must stick to a gluten free diet to remain symptom-free. While this has become easier in recent years, scientists have found some &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr8941" target="_blank"&gt;promising results in mice&lt;/a&gt; for disabling the disease. [via &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-therapy-suppresses-immune-reaction-to-gluten-in-mice" target="_blank"&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since celiac is an auto-immune disorder, finding ways to alter the immune response to gluten is one area of investigation to alleviate the symptoms of the disease. Using a so-called “inverse vaccine,” researchers “engineered regulatory T cells (eT&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) modified to orthotopically express T cell receptors specific to gluten peptides could quiet gluten-reactive effector T cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason these are called “inverse vaccines” is that, unlike a traditional vaccine that turns up the immune response to a given stimuli, this does the opposite. When the scientists tried the technique with transgenic mice, the mice exhibited resistance to the typical effects of the target gluten antigen and a related type on the digestive system. As with much research, there is still a lot of work to do, including testing resistance to other types of gluten and whether there are still long-term deleterious effects on true celiac digestive systems as the transgenic mice only had HLA-DQ2.5 reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds vaguely familiar, we covered &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/09/25/inverse-vaccines-could-help-treat-autoimmune-conditions/"&gt;“inverse vaccines”&lt;/a&gt; in more detail previously.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3200132/"&gt;Appendix cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a condition that, until recently, was so rare that most people never gave it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was the kind of disease that doctors might encounter only once or twice in a career, and it was almost always found in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; a surprising and concerning trend is emerging: &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;appendix cancer is being diagnosed more often&lt;/a&gt;, and it's increasingly affecting people in their 30s, 40s and even younger. This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine. Its purpose in the body is &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Why-do-Humans-have-an-Appendix.aspx"&gt;still debated&lt;/a&gt;, but it's best known for causing appendicitis, a painful inflammation that often requires emergency surgery. What's less well known is that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="164404" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; can develop in the appendix, usually without any warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, has shown that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically among people born after the 1970s. In fact, the incidence has tripled or even quadrupled in younger generations compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall numbers are still small (appendix cancer affects just a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9418812/#:%7E:text=Overall%2C%20the%20incidence%20of%20appendiceal,5.1%20to%2011.2%20per%20cent."&gt;handful of people&lt;/a&gt; per million each year) the rapid rise is striking. Even more notable is that about one in three cases now occurs in adults under 50, a much higher proportion than seen in other types of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's behind this surge? &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/vitamin-d-colon-cancer-b2744234.html"&gt;No one knows for sure&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the first suspects is the dramatic change in lifestyle and environment over the past several decades. Obesity rates have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3543235/"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s, and being overweight is a known risk factor for many cancers, including those of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, diets have shifted toward more processed foods, sugary drinks, and red or processed meats, all of which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;parts of the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, with more people spending long hours sitting at desks or in front of screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that we are being exposed to new environmental factors that previous generations didn't face. The industrialisation of food production, the widespread use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39518141/"&gt;plastics and chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and changes in water quality might all play a role. However, the evidence is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes appendix cancer especially challenging is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike colon cancer, which can sometimes be found early through screening colonoscopies, appendix cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094592/"&gt;usually flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms, if they appear at all, are vague and easy to dismiss. People might experience mild abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits, which are common complaints for many benign conditions. As a result, most cases are only discovered after surgery for suspected appendicitis, when it's often too late for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in cases, there is no routine screening test for appendix cancer. The disease is simply too rare to justify widespread screening, and the appendix can be difficult to visualise with standard imaging or endoscopy. This means that both patients and doctors need to be extra vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone experiences persistent or unusual abdominal symptoms, especially if they're under 50, it's important not to ignore them. Early investigation and prompt treatment can make a significant difference in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in appendix cancer among younger adults is part of a broader trend seen in other gastrointestinal cancers, such as those of the colon and stomach. These cancers, too, are being diagnosed more often in people under 50, suggesting that shared risk factors may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this shift are complex and probably involve a mix of genetics, lifestyle, environment and perhaps even changes in our &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; – the bacteria in our intestines that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882224/"&gt;live with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, antibiotics have been used more frequently, both in medicine and in agriculture. This widespread use can alter the balance of bacteria in our guts, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916407/"&gt;might influence cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests that early-life exposure to antibiotics could have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;long-term effects on the digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but more studies are needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg" alt="Different types of tablets or pills in foil packs" class="size-full wp-image-164410" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-484x415.jpg 484w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-600x514.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could early-life exposure to antibiotics have something to do with the rise in appendix cancer? (PublicDomainPictures/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake are also &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;. While these measures can't guarantee protection against appendix cancer, they are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard to unravel the mystery of why appendix cancer is rising so rapidly among younger generations. Understanding the causes will be crucial for developing better ways to prevent, detect and treat this rare but increasingly important disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, raising awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential. By recognising the signs and taking action when symptoms arise, we can improve the chances of catching appendix cancer early and giving patients the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of appendix cancer's rise is a reminder that even rare diseases can become more common when our environment and lifestyles change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a call to action for further research and for all of us to pay attention to our bodies, seek medical advice when something feels off, and support efforts to understand and combat this puzzling trend.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258607/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A new study suggests that these common medications might ease the mental decline linked with this devastating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; found a compelling connection between statin use and slower cognitive deterioration. Their findings, recently published in &lt;a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-023-01360-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer Research and Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, offer cautious optimism for a disease that affects millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined data from a national registry of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia. Those who were taking statins experienced a gentler decline in thinking ability than those who weren’t on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Statins, long hailed for lowering cholesterol, might offer an unexpected benefit beyond heart health.

Because the research was observational, it can’t prove that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-cholesterol-drugs-could-stop-cancer-growth/"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; directly cause the slower decline. Still, the pattern they saw raises important questions worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlled clinical trials will be essential to confirm whether statins truly offer this cognitive shield. Until then, the link remains a promising lead, but not a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/us-prescription-drug-prices-are-2-78-times-those-in-other-wealthy-nations-study-finds/"&gt;prescription-ready&lt;/a&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, doctors have been wary of giving statins to people with dementia. Concerns over side effects—particularly confusion—have made many cautious about their use in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Interaction between the patient’s and medication’s characteristics potentially influence the cognitive effects of statins. Two separate cholesterol pools in the body are thought to be connected to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), central and peripheral.

Her team believes these insights could spark a fresh look at the medications’ role in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s too early to change treatment guidelines, the evidence opens the door for further research. For now, statins remain a potential ally—one that deserves closer study in the fight against Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_but_preliminary_step"&gt;A Promising but Preliminary Step&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results of this study provide hope, they also highlight the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and the challenges of identifying effective treatments. The potential benefits of statins for certain patients warrant further investigation through rigorous clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the results of the study do not mean that we now have evidence that people with dementia should be treated with statins. But on the other hand, we can't see any support for not doing so. So, if a person needs statins for high &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-the-dietary-secret-to-brain-health-and-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood lipids&lt;/a&gt;, a dementia diagnosis should not stop the treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study incorporated data from over 15,500 dementia patients who also had indications for lipid-lowering treatment. Among them, nearly 11,000 received statin therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the patients on statins displayed slightly higher cognitive test scores despite having higher rates of conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-research-reveals-the-cause-and-cure-for-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, all of which are established risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia-Ptacek elucidates that their research began with the hypothesis that statins might decelerate dementia progression. They cast a wide net to explore if there was any evidence to substantiate this theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE score over time, in statin users compared to non-users of statins. The graph shows the association between increasing doses of statin treatment and MMSE over time, as predicted from the model.

Previous clinical studies have explored this idea, but they yielded negative results. Garcia-Ptacek and her team believe that these trials might have been too small to detect significant differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach focuses on pinpointing specific patient groups within the Alzheimer's spectrum that might benefit the most from statin treatment, and understanding why they respond positively. This preliminary study sets the stage for more refined investigations and potential &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-new-vaccine-could-protect-against-all-future-coronavirus-disease-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;future clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study hints at the potential benefits of statins in Alzheimer's patients, it serves as a critical stepping stone in unraveling the complex relationship between these drugs and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE score over time, in simvastatin compared to atorvastatin users.

The process produces the same chalky scale that lines well-used kettles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, those newborn flakes drifted through the swirling water and latched onto free-floating plastic, wrapping each shard until it sank and knitted itself into the growing crust at the bottom of the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests on three common resins – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/filter-feeders-transform-microplastics-into-a-bigger-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene&lt;/a&gt; – showed that at least four-fifths of these particles wound up trapped after a five-minute boil and a short cool-down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure climbed near ninety percent when the water held about 300 milligrams of calcium carbonate per liter, a level typical of hard-water regions from San Antonio to Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-minerals-matter"&gt;Why minerals matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water chemistry varies wildly across the United States. In soft water, where dissolved calcium dips below roughly 60 milligrams per liter, the Guangzhou group still recorded a twenty-five percent plastic drop. That is helpful but leaves most debris adrift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard water, by contrast, supplies more building blocks for limescale. The higher the mineral load, the more surfaces form for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/kitchen-germs-are-an-underestimated-threat-to-public-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic to cling to&lt;/a&gt;, so the removal rate rises quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the flakes grow fast, they can be rinsed or brushed away from cookware, taking the microplastics with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any fragments that stay suspended can be caught in a paper coffee filter – an item already parked next to many kitchen sinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method costs pennies, requires no electricity beyond the burner, and fits households that lack space or funds for advanced filtration systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evidence-outside-the-lab"&gt;Evidence outside the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that everyday heat can curb&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-widespread-in-the-seafood-we-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; invisible plastics&lt;/a&gt; meshes with recent field studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, scientists sampling bottled and tap water across Europe tallied anywhere from 19 to 1,154 particles per liter, with the highest counts of microplastics found in municipal supplies drawn from mineral-rich aquifers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By targeting the same minerals, the boiling trick offers a stopgap while policymakers debate stricter water standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies such as the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; state that current data are too thin to draw firm links between microplastic intake and disease, yet they encourage cutting exposure where practical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/environmental-health-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, in its strategic blueprint on environmental health, echoes that stance and calls for simple interventions people can adopt today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-the-kitchen"&gt;Tips for the kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your kettle already furs up between cleanings, you likely benefit most. Bring the water to a rolling boil for five minutes; let it stand until steam subsides, then pour slowly, leaving the whitish crust behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the kettle a periodic scrub to wash the captured plastics down the drain – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-escaping-from-water-treatment-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;municipal treatment plants&lt;/a&gt; are better equipped to trap larger, bonded particles than loose nanoscale ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in soft-water zones can still gain a modest cut by adding food-grade calcium, such as a pinch of pharmaceutical lime, before heating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team cautions that mineral additives should stay within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) secondary limit of 120 milligrams per liter for calcium to avoid taste issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boiling-water-vs-microplastics"&gt;Boiling water vs. microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiling is no silver bullet. Engineers are experimenting with bio-based filters that trap plastic shreds in wastewater plants, while chemists &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-process-converts-microplastics-into-valuable-graphene-wonder-material/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;explore enzymes&lt;/a&gt; that nibble bottles back into harmless molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Guangzhou study shows how an old-school practice can chip away at a modern pollutant without fancy gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing stovetop heat with a cheap paper filter slashes the largest doses that reach our mugs, even as science hunts for long-term fixes upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic pollution will not vanish overnight, yet this research reminds us that progress sometimes hides in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Science and Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 23:16:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNTVVMenFFalZHUXV3ZVpseVYyYWIteWJZbHZHMC1HbWltWHdLcEk1MzE5ODRxZmhacVBYSlg1eTBhV09kWW1wMWFkNEU5SEdOZ2FURzA1NzhkRUhodmt5cnpwS3BBd3lfUTQ2b25mbnZKRzZVOWpIckFpTDExWGwzaFBPNDA5eWp4RHpDcEZPanIwSjg</guid></item><item><title>露营者的水箱可能携带严重疾病，以下是修复方法- Autopian | Your Camper’s Water Tank Could Be Carrying Serious Diseases, Here’s How To Fix It - The Autopian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNVzZQamdUUVQ4MWZyZnpfbmxuMW9LSGphd2hQTWxhSUJ4elFkSkluaVRPSEp5azQ3S0RvbjVDTDRfQ19heEM2Q1Izak0xTlFfZDNoZDRBX292bWs0amZpMHJ2OGgtSVRUeUJKZnhKQ1NxMEtvQmRUSnVmZ0FXQkl4c2ROTGQ2UkVqbmJ2M0o5b3RkZjRINWt4anVramdTUlZtV095OUhUUUJZQTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-widget-container"&gt;
			&lt;p class="mailmunch-forms-before-post"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much RV that’s built some sort of self-contained standard has a tank for fresh water. You fill that tank and can use it for drinking water, showers, and cleaning food. But there can be a hidden danger in your RV’s water tank. If you never clean this tank out, it can be a vessel for serious diseases, possibly even one that could cause your death. Here’s how you can help protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about the cleanliness of RV freshwater tanks has been raised recently following a May 29 report by the Disease Control and Prevention. The report documents the case of an RV owner who used tap water from their RV for nasal irrigation. This person ended up catching a brain infection, which sadly turned fatal. What the CDC concluded in its investigation is chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-contained RV has existed throughout much of camper history. In essence, a self-contained unit is one that is capable of operating away from a source of power, sewer, and water. So, you’ll have a battery or generator for power, holding tanks for your wastes, and a tank for potable water. Some of the earliest motorhomes had self-contained features, and the 1958 Airstream International is often credited as being one of the first truly self-contained travel trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-207844 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa.jpg" alt="Adirondackeaa" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa.jpg 2189w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-768x384.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-2048x1024.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2189px) 100vw, 2189px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features are critical if you want to use your camper somewhere that’s not an improved campground. Every year, I spend a week with over 40,000 campers at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, depending on my family’s travel trailer’s water stores, battery, and a generator to be comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheryl and I have a hard rule to never use the RV’s water tank for internal use. This is because when we first started using the trailer for boondocking at AirVenture in 2023, we learned that there was something horribly wrong with the trailer’s water tank. The tank emitted a foul odor when we filled it, replacing the air inside with water. Then, when we used said water, we found little black particles in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207848" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207848 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash.jpg" alt="Eaawatersplash" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash.jpg 2560w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207848" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;My family’s 2007 Adirondack violently ejecting a drinking water hose. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family has owned this trailer since 2016, and I asked my parents about the last time they had the tank cleaned. They didn’t even know that was a thing, so it’s safe to assume that it hasn’t been cleaned in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a decade. If my parents didn’t know that you’re supposed to clean the water tank, how many other Americans are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Tragic Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; is something of nightmares. Here’s a snippet from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare, often fatal brain infection caused by the free-living ameba, Naegleria fowleri (1). Infection is typically associated with recreational water activities; however, using tap water when performing nasal irrigation is also a risk factor for PAM (2–4). Improperly maintained municipal water and recreational vehicle (RV) water systems can be a source of waterborne disease; CDC recommends the use of distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation.* Household safe water practices can help prevent waterborne illness associated with RV water systems. This report describes a fatal case of N. fowleri infection associated with improper use of a nasal irrigation device with suspected contaminated tap water from an RV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previously healthy woman aged 71 years developed severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status within 4 days of using a nasal irrigation device filled with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died 8 days after symptom onset. Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed the presence of N. fowleri in the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An epidemiologic investigation conducted by the Texas Department of State Health Services included a review of the patient’s medical and exposure history. The patient had no recreational exposure to fresh water; however, she had reportedly performed nasal irrigation on several occasions using nonboiled water from the RV potable water faucet during the 4 days before illness onset. This practice suggested two water sources of concern. The first was the RV’s potable water tank, which flowed directly to the faucets and shower when a municipal water connection was unavailable. The tank had been filled with water collected on an unknown date before the patient’s purchase of the RV 3 months earlier. The second potential source of contamination was the municipal water system, which was connected by a hose and water filter to the RV potable water system, bypassing the tank, at the time the patient used it for nasal irrigation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC then tested water from the campground and water from the RV’s tanks. No N. fowleri was found in these samples, but the CDC did find that the total chlorine and monochloramine disinfectant levels in the campground’s tap water were below the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s recommended levels. Combined with a low pH level, the presence of free ammonia, and unequal concentrations of active disinfectant, the CDC concluded that it was possible for pathogens to thrive in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from the RV proved to be even worse, with water quality that was lower quality than than recommended for drinking water, let alone water you’re going to shoot up your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the CDC couldn’t figure out if the source of the brain infection came from the RV’s tank or the campground’s tap water, and some of the blame might be because the samples were taken 23 days after the patient shot the water up her nose. However, the conclusion was pretty serious, with Texas public health officials and the CDC calling for, among other things, the maintenance of RV water systems and ensuring that municipal water systems are clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so there can be danger in your RV’s water supply. What can you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_68494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68494" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-68494 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255.jpg" alt="20230724 192312" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255.jpg 2560w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-768x384.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-2048x1024.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-68494" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The water filling station at EAA’s Camp Scholler. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is consider where your RV’s water is coming from. Countless campgrounds, especially remote ones, are pulling their water out of a well. As the CDC suggests up there, water straight from a campground’s taps could be dangerous, as the typical person will not know what’s in that water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some campgrounds bring city water into their taps. This water is generally safer and, so long as the delivery system from the campground’s pipes to your RV’s plumbing are clean, then there is less risk here. But even that requires you to assume everything is up to spec. As Joshua Baker of RV dealer Texas RV Guys noted in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/warnings-rv-water-cdc-woman-texas-died-brain-infection/3857106/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC DFW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, campground water systems aren’t well-regulated, either, so you can’t even trust that the government will keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Filtration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first line of defense is a water filtration system. There are tons of these things commercially available and the simplest of these systems is an inline filter. These filters screw right into the line going from your RV to the spigot at the campground. Some folks who infrequently use their RV might use a cheaper filter like a unit from Clear2O. People who are more serious about clean RV water invest in more expensive systems from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.clearsourcerv.com/collections/clearsource-rv-water-filter-systems"&gt;Clearsource&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goblutech.com/collections/rv-water-filter-systems/products/goblutech-ar3-led-uvc-elite-series-0-2-micron-4-stage-rv-water-filtration-purification-system"&gt;Blu Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which can either be used externally or mounted permanently to the RV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207851" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207851 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F.jpg" alt="Clear2o Rv Marine Inline Water F" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F.jpg 955w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-150x150.jpg 150w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-768x768.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-700x700.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207851" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Clear2O RV in-line filter. – Clear2O&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people also combine more than one system into one, such as an inline filter outside and another filter mounted to their coach, or two different types of filters outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207852" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207852 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x.jpg" alt="Welcome The Uvc Ar3 3 1080x" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x.jpg 1080w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207852" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blu Technology AR3 LED UVC High-Flow 4-Stage RV Water Filter – Blu Technology&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea I’ve seen around RV communities is that multiple filters is better and you want to get a filter that drills down to two microns as much as possible. Some folks will employ other measures, including installing a filter directly onto a faucet by tying it onto the feed line in the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation of an external filter is about as easy as you would expect, and you connect the filter to your water source and then connect the filter to your motorhome. If you have 36 minutes to spare, RV Youtube channel Our Journey In Myles explains one way to set this up while also reviewing a popular RV filtration system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the types of filters get properly nutty. There are sediment filters, which remove larger suspended matter like sand, scale, and clay from the water supply. Then you have carbon filters, which use activated carbon to absorb and remove impurities, including chemicals and organic contaminants. There are also UV-based water filters, which use UV-C to destroy bacteria and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another kind of filter that you’ll find is a gravity filter. These are pretty simple filters that use gravity to pull water through a filter, leaving behind contaminants and cleaner water. A very popular gravity filter among RVers is a &lt;a href="https://www.usaberkeyfilters.com/"&gt;Berkey&lt;/a&gt;; however, it’s notable that you wouldn’t be using one of these to take a shower. Instead, they’re more for getting cleaner drinking water. Some people will use a Berkey for drinking water and an inline filter system for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207853" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207853 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500.jpg" alt="91hc Vgr4tl. Ac Sl1500" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500.jpg 1500w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207853" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Berkey Filters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks will even buy a reverse osmosis-based water filtration system and plant it on their countertop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is no single answer for what kind of filtration system to use. I would recommend joining a forum for your particular model of RV and seeing what others are using with their rigs. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/b09ggk/just_upgraded_to_a_clearsource_dual_water_filter/"&gt;people swear by&lt;/a&gt; Clearsource equipment, influencers seem to like Blu Technology rigs, and a lot of people are just &lt;a href="https://alliancervowners.com/forum/threads/water-filtration-blu-tech-clear-source-others.2885/"&gt;creating their own&lt;/a&gt; budget filtration systems using parts from the hardware store meant for residential filtration systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, I’ll be trying out a water filtration system for myself. I’ve been RVing for over two decades, and yet even I’ve made the mistake of not using any real filtration system. That’s how much water quality gets ignored in the RV world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tank Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, a water filtration system is really your first line of defense. You also want to make sure that your RV is as clean as possible. Clean water is of little help if it’s getting contaminated by a camper that’s never been cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to clean both your tank and your lines. A commonly cited method for this would be to fill your RV’s tank with a water and bleach solution. A standard guideline is a quarter cup of bleach per 15 gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by draining any water that’s in your RV. Your fresh tank likely has a drain valve on its bottom, and your hot water tank likely has a similar valve. Be sure that your hot water heater is turned off during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230529_123804-1536x1152.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Your hot water tank might look like this. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve drained your camper, fill up your fresh tank with the bleach and water mix. One easy way to do this would be similar to putting an additive into your car’s gas tank. Put bleach in first using a funnel, then hit it with your water to mix it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re all filled up with bleachy water, turn on every faucet and shower in the trailer, ensuring to turn on the taps for both the cold and hot water. Turn off these faucets and the shower once you smell bleachy water coming out of all of them. Now, let the solution sit and marinate for between five to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230727_083647-1536x1152x.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you basically want to run the process in reverse. Run your faucets to fill up your waste tanks with the used bleachy water mix. Then, dump your tanks. Now, refill your fresh tank and run the faucets again until you don’t smell bleach anymore. Drain and refill your tank until the bleach has been eliminated. You can probably expect to spend about a day doing this whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable with bleach or don’t have somewhere to dispose of it (some campgrounds use septic systems), you can also use vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. There are also commercially available tank cleaning products that do a similar job to bleach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207849" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207849 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880.jpg" alt="Clear2otankfreshwatertank System" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880.jpg 1000w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880-300x240.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207849" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Clear2O&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shops recommend sanitizing your RV tank once every three to six months. Doing it with frequency is important because you don’t want mold, bacteria, parasites, algae, and other nasty stuff growing in your tank. Likewise, if you’ll be storing your camper after completing this process, you’ll want to store it with the tank emptied out rather than sitting for months with water just sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, many people, myself included, just buy jugs of water to drink out of and use the camper’s water supply only for cleaning and showers. However, admittedly, carrying around gallons of water is annoying. So, a lot of folks will go through the work to create a pretty comprehensive filtration system so that they can drink water from a campground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what you choose with filtration, I highly recommend that, at the very least, you clean out your RV’s water tank regularly. It’s easy to ignore something like this because your tank is out of sight and sometimes out of mind, but for the safety of yourself and your family, take a day out of your busy schedule to make sure your RV is as clean as it can be. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a 30-year study that started in 1985.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers were also looking for diabetes diagnoses over the 30 years of follow-up, of which there were 691 cases.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Statistical analyses were adjusted for certain demographics, including age, sex, race, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, diet quality and family history of diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants who consumed the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043120/trader-joes-best-beverages-for-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;most diet beverages&lt;/a&gt; had a 129% higher risk of diabetes compared to those who drank the least diet beverages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to those with lower intakes, those with the highest intake of saccharin, an artificial sweetener sometimes found in diet drinks, had a 110% increased risk of diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know it’s important to limit sugar, and beverages sweetened with sugar can be a major contributor of added sugar in our diets. But this study suggests that replacing regular sodas and other sweetened beverages with diet ones may not benefit you in the ways you’re hoping. It also suggests that they may even significantly raise your risk of developing diabetes—exactly the opposite of what you might think. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The scientific community has gone back and forth on the safety of artificial sweeteners. And while the FDA lists artificial sweeteners as “generally recognized as safe,” we also know that research is mixed on sugar substitutes—particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;when it comes to your gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study didn’t include sugar alcohols, a type of artificial sweetener, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-study-links-erythritol-with-higher-blood-clot-risk-8695390" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that they, too, may pose some risk, including for blood clots, which increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of stroke and heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study raises a lot of questions, which is a good thing with research. We still need more information to know if it’s only the artificial sweeteners raising the risk of diabetes, or if it's the combination of artificial sweeteners with other additives in the beverages. We also can’t know for sure if other additives in the drinks increase diabetes risk on their own, or if it’s a combination of the diet drinks and a poor diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite all these questions, here’s what we do know. Soda is far from being a whole food, but everything can fit in a varied and balanced eating pattern. Having a soda now and then is probably fine for most people. The key is how regularly you’re taking a soda break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you lean on your favorite fizzy pop to get you through a mid-afternoon slump, consider replacing it with an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/energizing-nut-free-snack-recipes-8549709" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;energizing snack&lt;/a&gt;, like some nuts and cheese for a mix of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. You could even take a quick walk or do some push-ups against your desk to get your blood pumping. Changing your physiology is one of the quickest ways to change your energy state. And making sure you’re staying well-hydrated and well-fueled may help prevent the slump to begin with. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you like soda for the bubbles, consider replacing it with an unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052890/sparkling-water-soda-water-club-soda-seltzer-water-mineral-water-tonic-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll get all of the fizz without the additives that soda contains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that those who drink high amounts of diet sodas and other diet beverages may significantly increase their risk of diabetes. Soda, whether sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners, may be a delicious option now and then, but should probably not be a regular on anyone’s menu. If you’re a regular soda imbiber, begin replacing one soda a day with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-gut-friendly-soda-is-my-go-to-drink-for-dry-january-8772967" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural beverages&lt;/a&gt;, including water, sparkling water or unsweetened tea. Milk and juice in moderation can work, too, and add essential nutrients. Over time, continue replacing your daily sodas one at a time until you get to the level you feel good with.&lt;br&gt;

Yet, this quiet mineral helps over 300 enzymes do their job, from calming the nervous system to balancing blood sugar levels. Many believe that eating a healthy, balanced diet should naturally provide enough magnesium. But here’s the twist: sometimes, even with all the leafy greens and whole grains on the plate, magnesium levels in the body might still fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This isn’t just about what goes into the body; it’s also about what stops it from staying. Here are some reasons why magnesium might be slipping away silently, and what can be done to bring it back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gut health might be blocking magnesium's entry&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, the magnesium intake may look perfect. Spinach, nuts, avocados — all there. But if the digestive system isn’t working smoothly, magnesium might not even get absorbed. Gut inflammation, often caused by undiagnosed conditions like IBS or even chronic stress, can quietly damage the intestinal lining. That lining is where magnesium slips into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is, magnesium depends on a healthy gut to be absorbed properly. Even frequent use of antacids or proton-pump inhibitors (often used for acidity) can reduce magnesium absorption over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Restoring gut balance with fermented foods like homemade curd or kanji, and reducing unnecessary medication use can slowly improve magnesium uptake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

But magnesium and calcium need to be in balance. When calcium dominates, magnesium gets overshadowed and flushed out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when calcium supplements are taken without proper guidance or blood testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is, magnesium and calcium share similar absorption pathways in the body. When one floods the system, the other gets left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritising magnesium-rich foods like pumpkin seeds, ragi, or black beans in meals that don’t include heavy dairy or calcium-fortified products can help restore the mineral balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden loss through sweat and stress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one rarely gets the attention it deserves. Excessive sweating, whether through intense workouts or just living in a hot climate, can quietly drain magnesium. But that’s not all. Chronic stress, even if it’s mental, signals the kidneys to flush out more magnesium through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always visible, but the loss is very real. Magnesium is one of the first minerals to get depleted during stress because the body uses it to calm the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium levels can be supported during periods of physical or mental stress by sipping on nimbu-pani with a pinch of rock salt or adding soaked seeds (like sunflower or pumpkin) to mid-meal snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Magnesium is water-soluble, which means it can easily leach into the water while boiling.
