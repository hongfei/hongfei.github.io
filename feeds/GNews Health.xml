Among adults, procedures such as filling cavities tend to peak in your early to mid-50s, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-org/files/resources/research/hpi/hpibrief_restorative_care_demand_patient_age.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Health Policy Institute&lt;/a&gt;. By the time you reach your 60s, you’re almost certain to need treatment for tooth decay. Figuring out exactly what dental care you need and when can be challenging. Yet there’s one key step that’s  simple and inexpensive: taking care of your teeth at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PIA6AEDE3BAUNAW6H3OOGU2UHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Though certain dental problems may require extra attention, the basics of brushing twice daily and cleaning between your teeth by flossing haven’t changed. And while plenty of companies would like to sell you pricey gadgets and special products for your oral health, you don’t need to shell out big bucks to keep your mouth in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MN6M5UU4H5BEBNHF3AKFCIZMWI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MN6M5UU4H5BEBNHF3AKFCIZMWI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How often for dental cleaning?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJODEAKLUFFDHFCBF4GTBRTBLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even with great home hygiene habits, you still need to see your dentist regularly for checkups and cleanings. Some people will need to visit more often than the standard twice a year, while others may be fine with less frequent visits. A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004346.pub5/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 review by Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of expert researchers, found that adults who visited the dentist every six months and those who visited on a schedule customized to their individual dental risk had comparable oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YT4YLNYPLVGWNAJIHGLJTK6QLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who are being treated for periodontal disease or who have dental implants — which can fail more quickly than a natural tooth — may need to see their provider every three months or so, says Martha McComas, a clinical associate professor of dentistry at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7LCDILVEFHBFD4JRCRH6IHLHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your dentist can help you figure out the right cadence for checkups, as well as your optimal at-home dental care strategy. “We can customize it based on what we see in your mouth,” says Karin Arsenault, program director of geriatric dentistry at the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4MUHYP2L4JEMTCZCMUW4EZODUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between visits, here’s what you need to know about the vital tools for keeping your teeth and your whole mouth as healthy as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MVTVEIWAPBBKTKB34DYVZMA7H4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MVTVEIWAPBBKTKB34DYVZMA7H4"&gt;Your toothpaste matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRI4FF7XEBB4TN765ZATBSOIUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fluoride is important. Fluoride is crucial because of the power it has to help fight cavities and tooth decay — something proved by decades of research. While some ingredients, notably a chemical called hydroxyapatite, have shown promise as viable alternatives, fluoride is still your best choice right now, according to the American Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAOXEKFBAFBEXKLRQMHSXQPSZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cavities occur when the bacteria in our mouths consume the traces of food left on our teeth, particularly anything sugary. As the bacteria gobble up these sugars, they release acid, which can remove minerals from our teeth’s enamel, eventually creating cavities. Fluoride can help replace some of these lost minerals, strengthening the surface of our teeth and repairing some damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RMXMCQKKKVEBHAOIGTX5UORUZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you’re shopping for toothpaste, look for one with the ADA Seal of Acceptance. To earn that seal, manufacturers need to not only include fluoride in their toothpaste but also meet other safety and efficacy standards, including one meant to ensure toothpastes aren’t too abrasive. (Very abrasive toothpastes can damage enamel.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD3AYWC2SFG2JMCQWPC2I6BKSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Watch out for this ingredient: If you’re prone to canker sores inside your mouth, you may want to look for a toothpaste that doesn’t contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jop.12845" target="_blank"&gt;2019 research review&lt;/a&gt; found that using an SLS-free toothpaste might help reduce canker sores in people who get a lot of them (about 25 percent of adults).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGT3CM3KJGSFO4YISQVRITNBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Skip charcoal toothpaste. Activated charcoal is often touted as a superior ingredient for a variety of products, including toothpaste. But it can be highly abrasive, which research has shown &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dental-oral-care/does-charcoal-toothpaste-work-a7477277301/" target="_blank"&gt;can damage your enamel and cause increased sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYUJCP3VONGNJHA4WYVHWG3LCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much toothpaste to use: Generally, adults need only a pea-size amount of toothpaste — that will create enough foam to cover all the surfaces in your mouth, Arsenault says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FJKIZZFJ5VCAJHJGUFOYLC6Q6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Also, “one of the big myths about toothbrushing is that you should rinse your mouth out after you brush,” says McComas. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896328/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show that the fluoride in your toothpaste provides the biggest benefit if you don’t do this&lt;/a&gt;, instead allowing the fluoride to work its magic on your enamel for more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EGKF7XID4FCRHGOIADURTCRZ64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What about prescription pastes? You may want to ask your dentist whether a prescription toothpaste, which generally contains a higher dose of fluoride, might be right for you. Severe dry mouth, which can be more common as you age (particularly if you’re taking certain medications for various chronic conditions, including for high blood pressure and depression), can raise your risk of cavities. So can periodontal disease, especially if the surfaces of the roots of your teeth, which lack protective enamel, are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HCDUXKCQQNBADLSO53HEZLF3MQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HCDUXKCQQNBADLSO53HEZLF3MQ"&gt;How to brush well&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HVJ7ZTQXQNAGNDWM3VXLZUDWSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The right bristles: Use a toothbrush with soft or extra-soft bristles. There are so many toothbrush options, but in the midst of considering the shape of the brush head, the brand name and other fancy features, don’t lose sight of bristle stiffness. Seek out a toothbrush with “soft” or “extra soft” on the packaging. Stiffer bristles are more likely to damage your gums or your teeth’s enamel, according to the American Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IT4MZEUCZZBBJI54XKOUSU5SOY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The advantages of an electric toothbrush: You can keep your mouth perfectly healthy with a manual toothbrush, but a &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health" target="_blank"&gt;2014 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found that three months of using an electric toothbrush resulted in 21 percent less plaque and 11 percent less gum inflammation (also called gingivitis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTW7JNRRHNBTLOGUCKWBPPCRYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/toothbrushes/is-a-sonic-or-a-rotating-electric-toothbrush-better-a1107158095/" target="_blank"&gt;not significant performance differences&lt;/a&gt; between oscillating (or rotating) electric toothbrushes, which typically have round heads, and sonic toothbrushes, which usually have rectangular heads. So get the kind you like and will use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ON3LQI4HCNCE7GRNGQIXVPDHKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much to brush: Do it twice a day for at least two minutes. Some research suggests that people may brush for a lot less time than this on average, possibly around a minute or less. But common sense and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723429/" target="_blank"&gt;2009 Journal of Dental Hygiene study&lt;/a&gt; suggest that brushing longer will remove more plaque — though the added benefit of extra time beyond two minutes is probably marginal, and brushing too hard can exacerbate problems, including receding gums, which can expose the roots of your teeth to a greater risk of cavities and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="BDAE2VS4PNFJDDQ5TP2I4JT5GY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="BDAE2VS4PNFJDDQ5TP2I4JT5GY"&gt;How to floss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FFIKPGFC7ZDETAMZOPE6XW7O3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Why flossing matters: Use any standard string floss (waxed or unwaxed), floss pick or interdental cleaning brush. The scientific evidence for flossing is not as strong as it is for brushing: A 2019 Cochrane review found that flossing in addition to brushing may reduce plaque and gingivitis more than brushing alone, but the authors cautioned that the evidence supporting this conclusion was weak. Still, dentists say the biological justification for flossing is sound: Without it, the bacteria that cause decay can build up between your teeth even if you’re brushing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EEIITIXH5EHZI4X5SIB5KRD24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Do water flossers work? While not quite as effective as string floss, water flossers can be a great option if you have a hard time using string floss, have mouth hardware like braces or a permanent retainer, or have other kinds of dental work like implants, bridges, or crowns. Dentist Sally Cram, a spokeswoman  for the American Dental Association, says the evidence on the benefits of a water flosser is encouraging, but it’s not enough for her to recommend it as a replacement for flossing just yet. Still, if you know you won’t use string floss every day, a water flosser is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMAVHRF44ZFBBD47KAAVWB4UYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Avoid floss with PFAS. Skip floss that’s coated with these environmental contaminants, which are associated with a variety of health problems. You can look for flosses that use non-PFAS coatings such as beeswax or plant waxes like carnauba or candelilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U6YB4NTPYBEY7FAM2OGL3EOPA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;CR partnered with Made Safe, an independent organization that certifies products as safer and more sustainable, to find flosses made without PFAS. Read &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/dental-floss-without-pfas-and-other-harmful-chemicals-a9722832754/" target="_blank"&gt;our special report, “How to Choose Dental Floss Without PFAS and Other Harmful Chemicals,”&lt;/a&gt; for the details, including three good floss options made from silk instead of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPQSJURHDBC7JDF5EWKVC7DTOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How often should you floss? Do it once a day. Whether you floss or brush first doesn’t matter, as long as you do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DDSKHUVEDBG2PE2WUQ2PCF326Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What if you have implants or gum disease? If you have an implant, you may want to opt for an interdental brush instead of regular string floss, particularly if your implant doesn’t touch the teeth next to it on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H2IOVMRTANEKRLXCRTLHT6CYAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These are tiny round brushes designed specifically to clean in between teeth, and they work well with teeth that have gaps in between them. They come in different sizes, so Jennifer Harmon, a registered dental hygienist and clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina Adams School of Dentistry in Chapel Hill, recommends working with your dentist to figure out which size you need for your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4IKIW6HLNC5BFSD2I7HUPO56I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re dealing with bleeding gums, Arsenault says, you can consider using prescription chlorhexidine mouthwash after you floss. Just be sure to follow your dentist’s instructions, because chlorhexidine can also cause some tooth staining and changes in taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ATEL5BV7MVEF5FJDESNMOQKRXI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ATEL5BV7MVEF5FJDESNMOQKRXI"&gt;Do you need these dental tools?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWTXB4XSTRGXFJOUNPRA5VRVPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tongue scrapers:&lt;/b&gt; The experts we spoke with say this is a great tool. The bacteria that cause tooth decay don’t just live on your teeth; they can collect on your tongue, too. That means you should clean your tongue daily. You can do this with your toothbrush bristles or the ridged back of some brushes, but a tongue scraper can be a little more effective,  Cram says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BUEAUKTJG5AN7CMYRFBKFWEGN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Plus, scraping your tongue is a great habit if you struggle with halitosis (bad breath), says Roxanne Dsouza-Norwood, a registered dental hygienist and clinical assistant professor of dental hygiene at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But be gentle; otherwise you could accidentally lacerate your tongue. And you may need to experiment with different types of tongue scrapers to find one that doesn’t activate your gag reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7YITL4TDOVE6TPTYGODOTRW3CI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whitening strips:&lt;/b&gt; Over-the-counter whitening strips can help your teeth look whiter, but it can sometimes be difficult to spot the change,  McComas says. You can try using them only on the upper teeth first so that the difference is more visible. (Then apply them to the lower teeth.) Keep in mind that the older you get, the more you can see the yellowish dentin underneath your enamel, which — along with crowns and implants — is not affected by strips. So you might end up with uneven colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZI3XIH32ERFINLVJ3CHX3PJBFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Strips can also cause sensitivity, particularly if you already have sensitive areas from gum recession, Cram says. So leave them on only as long as instructed on the package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ALTLSAHZFJFRRPE2J5RFR4UR5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthwash:&lt;/b&gt; Because swishing it around can coat parts of your teeth’s surface that are harder to reach with other tools, mouthwash can be a nice adjunct to your dental care routine, particularly if you choose one that has fluoride.

I knew something was seriously wrong, and I wasn’t going to stop until I found out what it was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years after Ava's ordeal began, blood and urine tests finally revealed Ava had been sickened by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14263615/health-expert-reveals-food-never-fridge-mold-poisoning.html"&gt;toxins from mold&lt;/a&gt; growing in the family's basement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ava Chambers, pictured here, came down with Covid at age 14. Soon after, her health rapidly deteriorated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ava, pictured here in the hospital, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and became so weak that she had to use a cane to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing of the family's home showed mold from the basement would vent into Ava's room, leaving the rest of the family healthy while Ava deteriorated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After removing mold from their home, Anna said her now 19-year-old daughter's recovery was 'like watching a miracle unfold.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't an easy process, and Ava is still healing, but she is doing so much better now,' she added.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Black mold, more formally known as Stachybotrys chartarum, grows in damp, warm environments like basements, bathrooms, kitchens, and areas with leaks or other forms of water damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It releases naturally occurring compounds called mycotoxins, which can accumulate in the body and lead to a host of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ava's case, the mycotoxins likely damaged her intestinal lining, causing inflammatory issues like ulcerative colitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mycotoxins can also suppress the immune system, irritate the lungs, and cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological issues like headaches, dizziness, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ava also tested positive for a mutation of her HLA-DR gene, which affects one in four Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene is believed to disrupt human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins, weakening the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been shown to make patients more susceptible to mold-related injuries. In fact, nine in 10 patients being treated for mold injuries test positive for an HLA gene mutation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ava was also diagnosed with two strains of Lyme disease and Epstein-Barr virus, a common illness that stays dormant in most people but can be reactivated through certain exposures, such as mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anna said the family 'firmly believes mold was the root cause' of Ava's ulcerative colitis, and the teen has stopped taking medications for the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ava is also managing her condition with a 'tailored protocol and detoxification plan.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows six types of mold you're most likely to find in your home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ava, pictured here with her mother, now manages her condition with a personalized detoxification plan. Her mother said: 'She’s cautious, and she knows that living a clean, non-toxic lifestyle is a part of her ongoing healing'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what exactly this entails, though antifungal medications, nasal sprays, and home remedies like breathing in salty air - halotherapy - and activated charcoal are thought to help manage symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anna said: '[Ava] knows she has the genetics that makes detoxing difficult, but now she also has the knowledge and skills to manage her health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She’s cautious, and she knows that living a clean, non-toxic lifestyle is a part of her ongoing healing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anna now urges parents and caregivers to trust their instincts if their child is suffering from a mysterious illness and not getting answers from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Our world is filled with toxins that can wreak havoc on the body. I believe people are starting to wake up to this reality, but there’s still so much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stories like ours can help raise awareness and bring about the changes in medicine that are desperately needed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:47:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Why urea is the ‘unsexy’ hero of skincare - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5BdHlNa2h1NGlLX2RnbW41MnNISW9mbnlSQUNsVWdwSmw3a3FfR0Y1QjZBdlF0S0daQUVNVVh3WEFaNm03dGpXV2l2SVl0Y3lfc1FocGg3TTFJd2thWjhhQ3prMERpbHl2YlpFb2dQdFIwOG9QRmRSdHJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;ike every industry, skincare has a few big-name players.

Well, some people associate it with urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about urea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-urea" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is urea?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Urea is a nitrogen molecule, and &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/urea" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a chemical byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the body’s metabolic breakdown of proteins. In mammals, it is found most abundantly in urine, as well as blood, sweat and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;More than 90% of global &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/u/urea.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;urea production&lt;/a&gt; goes into agriculture; it is a popular fertilizer ingredient and has been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40351-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as “the food of food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When it comes to skincare, urea is most often used in creams, but it can also be a component of gels, lotions and ointments. It serves as a humectant – meaning, it retains moisture in the top layer of the skin. This fortifies the skin barrier and results in “a more moisturized and plumped feeling to the skin”, says Strom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"372ae338-0ff0-454e-8217-4671db9795f7","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="372ae338-0ff0-454e-8217-4671db9795f7" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is sold in a range of concentrations, up to 40%. At concentrations above 10%, it also serves as a keratolytic, an exfoliant that helps the body shed the top layer of skin. If not exfoliated, dead skin cells build up and can result in dry, cracked skin, “like on the heels of the feet”, Strom says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-urea-pee" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is urea pee?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although urea is one of the most abundant components of urine, commercial urea is a synthetic produced in laboratories. You can see some very complicated diagrams about how it’s produced &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40351-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, none of which mention toilets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-conditions-can-a-urea-cream-treat" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which conditions can a urea cream treat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Urea is commonly used to treat skin that is “really dry and rough”, says Dr Naeha Gupta, a board certified dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These rough patches are often the result of conditions like eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratosis-pilaris/symptoms-causes/syc-20351149" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;keratosis pilaris&lt;/a&gt;, a common and harmless condition that causes small red bumps to appear on the upper arms, legs and buttocks. These conditions all can result in the buildup of dead skin cells, and “something like urea can be really helpful for breaking down the skin and letting it discharge”, says Strom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;High concentrations of urea can break down the thick-skin buildup in calluses, says Dr Rajani Katta, clinical professor of dermatology at the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Urea can also be used to “soften and remove damaged or diseased nails”, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19302-urea-skin-cream-gel-lotion-ointment-or-nail-lacquer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-use-urea-cream" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you use urea cream?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Low concentrations of urea – below 10% – are gentle and can safely be used on the body once or twice a day, Gupta says. She recommends applying a cream after a shower, when skin has been patted dry but there’s still some water on its surface. “The cream can really help retain that moisture,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While products with low concentrations of urea can be safely used by most people, Katta suggests that products with high concentrations of urea – 30% or above – be used under the supervision of a physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Since it can break down thick skin, it can also break down normal skin, so high concentrations are used in only specific areas and very carefully,” Katta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19302-urea-skin-cream-gel-lotion-ointment-or-nail-lacquer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, you should consult a physician if urea causes a rash, redness or irritation that doesn’t go away, or continued stinging or irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or breastfeeding, you should also &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19302-urea-skin-cream-gel-lotion-ointment-or-nail-lacquer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;talk to a doctor&lt;/a&gt; before using urea. This also applies if you have an infection; broken, inflamed or burnt skin; or allergic reactions to food, dyes, medicines or preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-people-use-pee-for-skincare-purposes" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Do people use pee for skincare purposes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Unfortunately, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-wiping-pee-on-my-face-did-for-my-acne/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;not unheard of&lt;/a&gt;.

And if it’s not, everything’s going to change,’” she tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After the surgery, when doctors discovered that her tumor was benign, Walsh kept her promise and started shifting the way she lived her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was all the cliché things — work less, spend more time with family and friends — and I was very fortunate,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ten years later, Walsh is still grateful that her health scare didn't go down a darker path, and she's hoping to pay it forward by encouraging everyone to get proactive about their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The 57-year-old is partnering with Grail as part of the healthcare company's &lt;a href="https://www.genpossible.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Possible&lt;/a&gt; campaign to highlight the value of early cancer screening and multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Per Generation Possible, MCED tests are available through authorized ordering providers and involve a blood draw that “can screen for many different types of cancer, often before symptoms appear.” This form of testing is particularly useful for cancers that “currently don’t have recommended screenings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When an MCED test detects a cancer signal, a patient's healthcare provider can offer recommendations for additional diagnostic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh is particularly passionate about early detection given her family's history with cancer. When she was in her early twenties, her father was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer and given six months to live, a prognosis Walsh recalls being "shocking and devastating." He ended up surviving for a year and a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Back then, cancer was like a death sentence. We’ve come a long way,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A few years later, Walsh's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in her early sixties and faced some difficult decisions while contemplating treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"I remember we thought, 'Is this a little extreme to have a double mastectomy?' And also we really naively thought that she would be in the clear because she was in her sixties. We didn’t have any history of cancer in the family on my mother’s side of the family," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After undergoing a double mastectomy, Walsh's mother went on to live into her nineties. The health scare inspired Walsh to get early breast cancer screenings herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"That was something I really kind of fought for because my health carriers were like, ‘Why should we do that?’" she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Several decades later, Walsh tapped into the same perseverance to advocate for herself when she started experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/kate-walsh-brain-tumor-symptoms-rcna194188" target="_blank"&gt;exhaustion and cognitive symptoms &lt;/a&gt;that made her think something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"A lot of people were like, 'You’re just depressed. You’re sad because your TV show got canceled.' Or 'You’re a woman of a certain age and going through menopause, and that’s probably it.' It was like, something doesn’t feel right, and I had to keep pushing and pushing and pushing and advocating. And, thank goodness I did," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg" alt="Kate Walsh."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Kate Walsh had a benign brain tumor removed in 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;GRAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eventually, Walsh got a diagnostic MRI that showed she had a tumor in her brain. After surgery, she got the good news that it was benign. From there, she began to make some lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh had been working in TV with "intense" hours for so long at that point that she was ready for a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think when you’re younger, you’re like, ‘I don’t want to miss out on life. I’ve got this massive job, so I’m going to burn the candle at both ends,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh had always prioritized working out as part of a balanced lifestyle, but she started to focus a bit more on rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Rest became a big thing and a surrender. It’s like they say, the body keeps score. For me, that was absolutely true. And so if I was tired, I was like, ‘Ok, I’ve got to rest,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, there are many possible cancer risk factors including age, smoking, drinking and chronic health conditions. Since maintaining a healthy diet and staying physically active can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/cancer-prevention/art-20044816" target="_blank"&gt;lower your chances of developing cancer,&lt;/a&gt; these are two things Walsh focuses on as part of a healthy lifestyle these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The actor says she eats "pretty well" but doesn’t deny herself when cravings arise, especially when potato chips are involved. When it comes to her workouts, Walsh loves Pilates and has made lifting weights a key part of her routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Weight training is critical for bone density and muscle strength. All of my friends that are in their 50s, we’re all talking about lower body strength especially. You’ve got to be able to sit down on the floor and be able to get up unassisted," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg" alt="Kate Walsh."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Kate Walsh enjoys weight training as part of her workout routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;GRAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For those who have a family history of cancer like Walsh, the &lt;a href="https://www.genpossible.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Possible website&lt;/a&gt; features a quiz to determine if MCED testing is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"The great thing about what’s happening in our culture now is that there is a move towards prevention, as opposed to being reactive. And so this is just another step in that direction,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, Walsh cautions that MCED testing is best used alongside routine checkups at the doctor's office and traditional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Though the actor played a doctor on “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Private Practice,” she admits that she still gets intimidated going to medical appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"I get very nervous about talking to doctors and I kind of dissociate. I leave my body and I’m like, ‘Wait, what am I supposed to ask you?’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Generation Possible website features a discussion guide to offer patients resources for talking to their doctors about their cancer risk factors. Unfortunately, Walsh knows firsthand that a trip to the doctor can often be the start of a long and frustrating quest for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh is a big proponent of advocating for yourself, even when you meet roadblocks along the way. To help, she recommends bringing a friend or partner to your appointments to take notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;"We’ve been socialized (to believe) that doctors are experts in their field, which indeed, many of them are. But we’re supposed to not ask and just listen and say, 'Ok you take it away.' And there isn’t a dialogue. And that’s the thing, there has to be a dialogue," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:26:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNSEtCT1oyVUk2Ui0wUzRmSUR6cjU3a09NbEVrWFZaa3JIQ21Rd3NBNVRkTTlyeTR6SU9ScnNSTTdIcFRpNEFObF90UERieWZCZlltaWRoVkFISVU0ZUItT0RCalhmRU52QTVWU2V0ZlZsRWZsdEtUNGhOYVlPY1d6TWdmM2F4dWk4RzN0cnJReVFGTkJlZ2ZUZ05rZkJDQdIBVEFVX3lxTE5lMDJHZVJxTloydExQWGFGZVRPaFRfbkpPQTRLcC1neUpkSFUwVXlSNmZwUHdmZ3F0bF9fdC1Rdl9yRGFpcmFjakI3bWpCVTBzSVJHcw</guid></item><item><title>UN agency warns of ‘unprecedented’ bird flu threat as H5N1 virus jumps to mammals - POLITICO Europe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNcGVxVlNwT09iZVY4Q0ZTMjRKMjAzdnV6ZjlqaTA5dzUyU3dObUtmNktZUVVESER5Xy1TUVdxRHF4NEc0VW9hak4wY3R2dHBfREJVQ0VOb1hiZ0JaZElyTlA3OTFSRFdXdlVZdU5La21Ud01MVTJBNm5jVmVtTGdXM0pYNmx5WlplQWFvN19qTE5rYk1WVkpRRlpiaFkyMWdCaU1YVVU1T3pjbjU5NjEtNDln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="card__content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Children in the United States are increasingly suffering from persistent or severe health conditions, many of which are preventable and could follow them into adulthood, according to new research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings come from a long-term survey of more than 230,000 young people, whose families reported whether they had any chronic conditions, like asthma, or functional limitations, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the results, the percentage of kids who are dealing with any of these conditions or limitations has risen from nearly 23 percent in 1999 to just over 30 percent in 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's nearly one in three young people who are now thought to be living with severe or activity-limiting health concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In children aged 5 to 17, the survey's data suggests the jump in chronic conditions is mainly due to ADHD/ADD, autism, and asthma. For young adults between 18 and 25, on the other hand, the increase is largely because of asthma, seizures or epilepsy, and pre-diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154919" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-642x361.png" alt="Child Chronic Health Conditions" class="size-medium wp-image-154919" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-642x361.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-739x415.png 739w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-768x431.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-1536x863.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-600x337.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL.png 1798w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154919" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Annual trends in chronic conditions and functional limitations in children from 1999 to 2018.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because some of these conditions are preventable, the results hint at an overlooked and underserviced population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We estimate that there are currently 87.4 million youth ages 5 and 25 in the US, of which 25.7 million reported any chronic condition or functional limitation," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00035-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the authors of the study, Lauren Wisk, who studies health services at the University of California Los Angeles, and pediatrician Niraj Sharma from Harvard University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This amounts to 1.2 million youth with a chronic condition or functional limitation who currently turn 18 each year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154920" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-642x361.png" alt="Young Adult Chronic Health Conditions" class="size-medium wp-image-154920" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-642x361.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-739x415.png 739w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-768x431.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-1536x863.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-600x337.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults.png 1798w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154920" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Annual trends in chronic conditions and functional limitations in young adults from 1999 to 2018. (Wisk and Sharma, &lt;em&gt;Academic Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's a lot of children who will need ongoing care as they grow older. Past &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4098714/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggest, however, that doctors in the US are poorly prepared to treat rising conditions of childhood origin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a paper from 2014, researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4098714/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;wrote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that when transitioning from pediatric to adult-centered health care, "many youth do not receive the age-appropriate medical care they need and are at risk during this vulnerable time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figuring out what is actually driving these upward trends in pediatric chronic conditions will require much more detailed research. There are likely numerous factors at play, including a "complex interaction of individual biology, community context and environment, and health care systems," explain Wisk and Sharma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the two co-authors carefully accounted for a whole variety of socioeconomic variables that may be influencing their results, they found substantial disparities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids with chronic illnesses were more likely to be poor, unemployed, or have public, not private, insurance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Most youth with chronic conditions need to access health and social services for the rest of their lives, but our health system is not set up to successfully move young people from pediatric to adult focused care and so many of these youth are at risk of disengaging with care and experiencing disease exacerbations," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/pediatric-chronic-disease-prevalence-has-risen-nearly-30"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Wisk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We should invest in assisting these youth in engaging appropriately with healthcare across their lifespan in order to protect their health and well-being, and to facilitate their maximum participation in society with respect to education, vocation, social groups, and community spaces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, as of 2019, the same survey used in the current study – called the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) – no longer asks as many detailed questions related to chronic conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This makes it harder to gauge where we are headed, or how the 2020 pandemic impacted childhood mental and physical health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This means we no longer have the ability to track and analyze trends in chronic health conditions in youth past that date," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/pediatric-chronic-disease-prevalence-has-risen-nearly-30"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wisk. "We need to find creative new ways to continue to monitor the health of our nation's youth if we want to further study this population."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00035-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Academic Pediatrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But more research has shown that, actually, for most people, the cholesterol in eggs &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/nutrition/article-13101983/foods-high-fat-cholesterol-heart-health.html"&gt;has little effect on blood&lt;/a&gt; cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, factors like saturated and trans fats in the diet play a more significant role in heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shrimp and pork, Dr Levine added, are healthy &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14496553/I-admitted-hospital-eating-protein-weeks-reason-make-you-never-want-eat-steak-again.html"&gt;protein alternatives to red meat&lt;/a&gt; despite doctors’ warnings about their cholesterol and saturated fat contents, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And avocados similarly slammed for being high in fat, are full of healthy monosaturated fat that can lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coffee, maligned by some in the medical community for years due to caffeine’s ability to increase a person’s blood pressure and heart rate temporarily, posing a risk for someone with pre-existing high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But actually,’ Dr Levine &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drevanlevine/video/7460663938993212703"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, ‘all have been found not to be true.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cardiologists have long warned against cholesterol-rich and saturated fat foods but may have targeted the wrong ones. Dr Evan Levine of Mt Sinai Hospital highlighted five foods once discouraged for heart health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Coffee has long been criticized for temporarily raising blood pressure and heart rate, but research shows no significant link between coffee consumption and long-term hypertension risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shifts in thinking about foods – which are harmful and which are good – are due to evolving research surrounding fats and fat intake, particularly saturated fats, the growing emphasis on whole foods, understanding of the impact of ultra-processed foods, and the rise in more personalized diet and nutrition plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further, scientists have since collected decades-long study findings about the complex relationship between nutrition and heart disease, along with a laundry list of other health problems affecting every organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have vacillated more on coffee than on any other beverage over the past six decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evidence pointing to its benefits and risks continues to pile up, causing people to wonder whether their daily cup could be putting their heart at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The caffeine in coffee has been found to have a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24203773/#:~:text=Though%20caffeine%20drinkers%20may%20exhibit,the%20BP%20effects%20of%20caffeine."&gt;minimal effect&lt;/a&gt; on blood pressure. In 2022, researchers in Korea reviewed 13 long-term studies with nearly 315,000 people and found no significant connection between coffee intake and &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jkms.org/pdf/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e332?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;high blood pressure risk&lt;/a&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said: ‘Even the American Heart Association says it’s heart healthy. Just don’t add sugar and cream.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A black cup of coffee contains just a few calories and none of the added fat from cream or whole milk. Dairy, especially full-fat dairy, contains high amounts of saturated fat known to raise LDL cholesterol in the blood, which is linked to both heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, Dr Levine recommends holding the butter and the salt when making your morning eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition science has changed in recent years as more experts and scientists acknowledge that blood cholesterol levels are mostly determined by the amount of fats and carbohydrates in the diet, not by dietary cholesterol such as that found in eggs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs cooked in olive or avocado oil are ‘loaded with nutrients, unsaturated fatty acids, and can actually increase your HDL [good] cholesterol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cholesterol in the yolks, he added, has little to no impact on the cholesterol in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That was the fear for years,’ he said. ‘But guess what… It’s the stupid saturated fat that your liver takes up and makes cholesterol that causes your cholesterol to go up. Eating cholesterol may even reduce your liver from making it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cholesterol worries have also kept doctors from endorsing shellfish, especially shrimp, for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While high in cholesterol, shellfish like shrimp, lobster, and crab do not have the same impact on blood cholesterol levels as foods high in saturated fats, like red meat or processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most people, dietary cholesterol—such as that found in seafood and eggs — has a minimal effect on raising blood cholesterol compared to the amount of saturated and trans fats in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pork is another healthy protein source often outshined by chicken. Leaner cuts like pork tenderloin and loin chops are relatively low in fat and can be part of a heart-healthy diet when consumed a few times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating a pork tenderloin is nothing like eating bacon or sausage, which are processed with preservatives and sky-high amounts of added sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eating just one avocado a week cut the risk of heart disease by up to a fifth in a study of more than 100,000 people (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And unlike beef, which has a slightly higher saturated fat content, unprocessed pork is a healthy low-fat protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avocado has also been maligned for its fat content, ‘but it contains lots of dietary fiber and what kind of fat? Unsaturated fats, especially the real healthy stuff, the monosaturated fats.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in 2022 in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.024014#:~:text=Clinical%20Perspective&amp;amp;text=In%202%20large%20US%20cohorts,disease%20and%20coronary%20heart%20disease."&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; followed more than 110,000 people for 30 years and found that eating at least one whole avocado each week reduced heart disease risk by 16 percent compared to those who did not eat any avocado.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of coronary heart disease, a condition caused by the narrowing of arteries due to plaque build-up, was 21 percent lower in those who ate at least one avocado weekly than those who ate none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said: ‘Replacing animal products like butter, cheese, or bacon with avocado – makes sense – is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘On top of an egg, on top of anything, a salad, a piece of chicken or pork, sounds good to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:53:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Mom, 35, With Colon Cancer Says Doctors Dismissed Symptoms for Months - TODAY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNemQwWVpTcVdSMzQxRm9YdG84dWdEV1NrV1pHUEZtallTRER1bHpod0x6ajd3bE1XQUFqNFVIZ3hVTjFWNlYwb05meUltRXlza3dhd29ETGNCMkxnM1hoREVlWTl4ekVfY2pLRUE4VDJBR3V0YkVaS3UwdzFWRERETmdENEE0S0ZieGNEbWVOVdIBVEFVX3lxTE1FUDgzN2ItdkRMVk9Xd0NNcENPWWlWY3M0ci1CeE10SWJUaUpmN1FQQThONEU1LXp4TDBaM19RbXZKZWVNdFU3ck5PM01LcklQZjhTZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Weeks after grappling with norovirus, Jessica Wozniak’s stomach felt off.

A colonoscopy found that she had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(The doctor) says, ‘Yeah, you have two masses in your colon that are cancerous,” she recalls. “It was quite a shock.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'I wasn't feeling normal' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In February 2024, Wozniak contracted the norovirus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was vomiting, diarrhea,” she says. “It was pretty graphic and bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After Jessica Wozniak experienced stomach cramping for months, doctors found that she had Stage 4 colon cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Jessica Wozniak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While she slowly began feeling better, she never completely rebounded and “wasn't feeling normal in my digestive system,” she explains. Wozniak and her husband were planning on having another child to join their daughter, and Wozniak had stopped taking her birth control pills. She wondered if that contributed to how she felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These things all happened at the same time,” she says. “I gave it a couple of weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her GI symptoms lingered and worsened. When she had a telehealth visit in April, she mentioned them to her doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I said, ‘Gosh, I’m getting stomach cramps every morning. While I was eating breakfast, I just doubled over with cramps,’” Wozniak recalls. “They asked me some questions and were like, ‘Oh, it could be ovarian cysts. I think you should go get a CT.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak went to the emergency room, and the wait time was so long that she decided to schedule with one of her providers and went to the midwife group who delivered her daughter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They were a little bit dismissive, like, ‘Well, yeah, this is an ovarian cyst. That sounds exactly what it is. It’s going to be a lot of pain. You probably have gas pain, too,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They ordered an ultrasound and assured her the cysts would “rupture of go away on their own” and she would be “fine.” The technician detected an ovarian cyst but noticed something on the ultrasound on her left side but felt unsure of what it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At one point after that visit, it seemed like the cyst had burst because Wozniak experienced “terrible pain.” But her stomach cramps never improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every time I had to have a bowel movement, it was pain, it was cramping,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her primary care doctor ordered a CT, which found bowel inflammation. That prompted a colonoscopy. Even still, the doctor didn’t seem overly worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The gastroenterologist was like, ‘I don’t think this is cancer,’” Wozniak says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But when she woke from her colonoscopy, Wozniak learned she did have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was diagnosed early June of 2024 with colon cancer,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Wozniak knew her paternal grandparents had colon cancer, they were in their 60s when they were diagnosed. Her paternal aunt learned she had colon cancer at 47, and Wozniak's father received a colon cancer diagnosis around the same time as Wozniak. It wasn’t until she was diagnosed that she learned there could be a genetic link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“No one had ever told me that there was a genetic test I could do,” she says. “I was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Lynch syndrome is an inherited genetic mutation that increases one’s risk of developing a variety of early-onset cancers, including colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s still a shock to me that … this didn’t cross anyone’s mind, and here I was at 35 being diagnosed with Stage 4 (colon cancer),” she says. “This really shouldn’t happen. We should have known. There’s things out there to learn about sooner.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Jessica Wozniak enjoys riding horses and did it as much as she could before her diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Jessica Wozniak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-rising-young-people-lynch-syndrome-rcna100443" target="_blank"&gt;People with Lynch syndrome&lt;/a&gt; often undergo a variety of cancer screenings in an effort to detect any cancers at an earlier stage, and they also might receive different treatment after diagnosis. For example, Dr. Matthew Yurgelun previously told TODAY.com that immunotherapies — treatments that bolster the immune system to fight the cancer — work “exceptionally well,” in many Lynch syndrome-related cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak’s doctors recommended a treatment plan that included four rounds of two immunotherapy drugs, which she began in July. A CT scan after those treatments showed that her liver metastases, were shrinking but another mass in her sigmoid colon appeared to be growing. Her doctors wanted to shrink and reduce most of her masses so they could perform surgery with clear margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My doctor’s recommendations was to continue the immunotherapy and add on chemotherapy,” Wozniak says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But before Wozniak could start the new treatment, her insurance at the time, Cigna, denied it and recommended that she only do chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They said, ‘No, no, no, immunotherapy is not working,’” she says. “My doctor said, ‘It is. Here’s the scan that shows the liver (masses) getting smaller.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak learned she could appeal, but she felt stunned by her insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I thought, ‘Who are you to decide that for me? You’re not my doctor,’” she says. “It made me really upset. It made me really angry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She and her family took to social media to ask what she could do, and people offered suggestions, including working with her human resources department at work on the appeal, which she did. She also reached out to the pharmaceutical company asking if she could pay for it directly. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/consumer/woman-denied-stage-4-colon-cancer-treatment-finds-ally-in-her-hr-department/3666321/?_osource=sm_npd_nbc_nat_tod_gen" target="_blank"&gt;NBC Chicago&lt;/a&gt; covered her story in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak soon learned her treatment would be covered by her insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Jessica Wozniak learned that she had Lynch syndrome, a inherited genetic mutation that causes people to develop certain cancers and at a younger age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Jessica Wozniak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cigna provided TODAY.com with a statement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have developed clinical guidelines to ensure that all patients receive safe and appropriate care. Our guidelines are based on published medical literature, leading clinical experts, and for oncology, the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Afterward, doctors want to perform an MRI to see how the masses have responded. There’s a tumor near her pelvic wall that doctors worry they cannot yet remove with clean margins. Since July, she’s hoped that she could undergo surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’ll remove the majority of my colon except a small piece at the end and they’ll re-route my small intestine to take over that bit,” she says. She will likely also undergo a combination of resection and ablation in her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak has six masses in her liver, but the surgeon believes they can be addressed. At some point, she will have a hysterectomy because Lynch syndrome can cause uterine cancers, and she’ll also have her fallopian tubes removed to protect against ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Having the support of her family while undergoing treatment has helped Jessica Wozniak grapple with some of the tough things she's faced.

Here’s how to protect yourself.(Image by Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Rajiv Kovil, Head of Diabetology at Zandra Healthcare and Co-Founder of Rang De Neela Initiative, claimed, “Early identification of kidney disease in diabetes is crucial to delay its progression to kidney failure and most people with kidney disease in diabetes eventually die of heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explained, “Podocytes are specialised cells in the kidney's tissue, which is called the glomerular, which play a critical role in maintaining the filtration barrier. In T2DM, persistent hyperglycemia leads to podocyte injury, loss, and ultimately, resulting in protein leaking in urine . Podocyte loss is an early marker of diabetic kidney disease, often preceding a significant reduction in kidney function.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/04/10/Pictures/diabetes_f111cd5e-fefe-11e5-b2cb-21770897bf70.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Shutterstock)" title="Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rajiv Kovil elaborated, "The Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) is a key diagnostic marker that can detect early kidney damage. An elevated UACR (&amp;gt;30 mg/g) suggests albuminuria, which is indicative of early kidney disease. Early identification of elevated UACR enables timely therapeutic intervention to prevent progression to kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early treatment strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rajiv Kovil, early treatment strategies aimed at reducing UACR can significantly slow kidney disease progression -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patients with diabetic kidney disease often present with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or diabetic macular edema (DME), and vice versa. Managing blood pressure, blood glucose, and kidney function concurrently can reduce the risk of retinopathy progression in diabetic patients with CKD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a revolutionary class of drugs in managing both diabetes and CKD. SGLT2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, work by blocking glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to glucose excretion and osmotic diuresis This mechanism results in reduced intraglomerular pressure, thereby protecting the kidneys from progressive damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD with diabetes:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Reduction in Albuminuria: Studies like the EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD trials demonstrated significant reductions in albuminuria, thereby slowing CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Preservation of Kidney Function: Long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors reduces the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Cardiovascular Protection: SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce cardiovascular events, a major cause of mortality in diabetic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Delaying Dialysis or Kidney Failure: By reducing intraglomerular pressure, SGLT2 inhibitors help delay the onset of ESRD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rajiv Kovil asserted, “Chronic kidney disease remains a major complication of type 2 Diabetes, with significant morbidity and mortality. Early detection through UACR and managing proteinuria are essential strategies to slow kidney function decline.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2017/02/14/Pictures/_7f58aeb8-f277-11e6-bee8-7b74d3637aa8.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Deficiency in anti-ageing hormone, called Klotho, could have a reason to play in diabetic patients getting kidney diseases.(Shutterstock)" title="Deficiency in anti-ageing hormone, called Klotho, could have a reason to play in diabetic patients getting kidney diseases.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Deficiency in anti-ageing hormone, called Klotho, could have a reason to play in diabetic patients getting kidney diseases.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded, “The advent of SGLT2 inhibitors has revolutionised the management of diabetic kidney disease by reducing albuminuria, preserving renal function and offering cardiovascular protection. As the burden of diabetes rises in India, widespread adoption of SGLT2 inhibitors, routine screening, and early intervention can substantially reduce the progression of CKD in diabetes, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;McAllen, Texas (seen here), is the most obese city in America, researchers at WalletHub found in a new study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rankings come as a record &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14110115/record-adults-obese-overweight-map-fattest-areas.html"&gt;three in four Americans are now considered overweight or obese&lt;/a&gt;, according to the latest CDC data.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chip Lupo, analyst at financial firm WalletHub, who conducted the research, said: 'Obesity is becoming more and more prevalent in the US, and it’s costing us big time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the most overweight and obese cities, residents often lack easy access to healthy food and recreation opportunities, so investing in those areas should help improve people’s diets and exercise regimens, and reduce the financial burden overall.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;WalletHub compared 100 of the most populated cities in the US across three metrics: overweight and obesity, health consequences, and food and fitness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then looked at the share of overweight children, teenagers, and adults in each area, as well as projected obesity rates by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health consequences measured included high cholesterol, high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-c8c709f0-010f-11f0-8e91-c5e380c9c419"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and obesity-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also evaluated how many residents had access to healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, as well as parks and recreational facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data was sourced from the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-c8c646a0-010f-11f0-8e91-c5e380c9c419"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USDA, and county health rankings, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team assigned scores to each metric, with a higher score indicating a worse ranking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McAllen was crowned the most obese city with a score of 85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that 45 percent of its adults are obese and another 31 percent are overweight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McAllen also has the second-highest share of obese teenagers and the fifth-highest share of obese children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city has the eighth-highest amount of people with diabetes and the fourth-highest heart disease rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said this could be due to McAllen having the highest rate of physical inactivity in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team wrote: 'That may not be entirely their fault, considering McAllen has the second-lowest percentage of residents who live close to parks or recreational facilities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The WalletHub rankings come as three in four Americanas are now overweight or obese (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers believe McAllen, which sits on the southern border with Mexico, is the most obese city due to low exercise rates and a lack of access to healthy foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Honolulu, Hawaii (seen here), is the least obese city. The researchers said this is likely due to abundant access to healthy foods and high rates of physical activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas, scored an 84 and took second place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said this was due to the 203,000-person city having the fourth-highest rate of obesity among children ages 10-17, 23 percent, with nearly another 17 percent of young people being overweight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little Rock also has the fourth-highest percentage of adults with high blood pressure and also the fifth-highest heart disease rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers attributed Little Rock's obesity problem to it having the second-least amount of health educators per capita and limited access to healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said: 'The problem will likely remain for the foreseeable future, too, as Little Rock has the second-highest projected obesity rate for 2030.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jackson, Mississippi, was the third fattest city in the US, moving down one spot from second place &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13197683/america-obese-cities-study-rates.html"&gt;this time last year&lt;/a&gt;. The area scored 83.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 37 percent of adults in the 150,000-person city are considered obese, and Jackson has the second-highest percentage of adults who have had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, nearly 37 percent of adults have high blood pressure, raising their risk of heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Not exercising regularly is a big reason why many of Jackson’s residents are overweight and obese. The city has the second-highest rates of physically inactive adults, and many residents lack easy access to healthy food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mobile, Alabama, and Knoxville, Tennessee, rounded out the top five, both scoring 83.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both cities had the two highest 'health consequences' rank, which is based on the amount of adults with high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and deaths from obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Honolulu, Hawaii, was deemed the least obese city in America with a score of 59. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found the 1million residents in the metro area had the greatest access to healthy food and exercise of all 100 cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The area also had the fourth-lowest rate of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes and sixth-lowest obesity rate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="health" id="mol-1bb07980-032c-11f0-8603-b716014ba0ee"&gt;

When he stuffed some paper towels inside and smeared them around, he was in for a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The towels were white – until I pulled them out," says Behnke, an expert in food safety at Purdue University in Indiana, US. "I realised that the slippery sensation I felt in the interior of the bottle was not because of the material but rather because of a bacterial build-up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His next step was to design a study. Behnke and colleagues &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;stopped passers-by in a corridor&lt;/a&gt; at Purdue and asked if they would be happy to loan their water bottles to them as part of their research – to see how clean they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"One thing that stood out from the project was the number of people who didn't want to know the results," recalls Behnke. "Basically, they knew that their cleaning habits were poor to non-existent – something the data later confirmed." The results &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;confirmed that those bottles were brimming with bacteria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while they help people to stay hydrated, drinking from water bottles regularly, and taking them with us everywhere we go, may also pose health risks. So, should we ditch them, or can those risks be managed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="what-exactly-is-inside-reusable-water-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="what-exactly-is-inside-reusable-water-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;What exactly is inside reusable water bottles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While it's usually safe to drink, water from our kitchen taps is not devoid of microbial life. This is why leaving water in your bottle for a few days will encourage bacteria to grow, says Primrose Freestone, associate professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Leicester, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bacteria that can cause human infections thrives at around 37C (98F) Freestone says, but it can also multiply at room temperature, around 20C (68F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The longer water in a bottle is stored at room temperature, the more bacteria will grow," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One study conducted in Singapore using boiled tap water – which should have killed most bacteria in it – found that bacteria populations can grow rapidly inside water bottles as they are used throughout an average day.

Whether you take your bottle to work, the gym, or even just keep it in the house, the outside of your bottle will carry many microbes. And these microbes are easily transferred into the contents of the bottle, along with bacteria from your mouth every time you take a sip, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Water bottle users who don't wash their hands regularly will also find that their bottles can harbour bacteria such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, Freestone says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Poo-associated bacteria, such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, can come from our hands and end up on our lips if we're not good at toilet hygiene," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People generally have between 500 and 600 different species of bacteria living in their mouths says Freestone. "What isn't necessarily disease-causing for you isn't always the case for others. You can carry an infection and not realise it, because our immune systems are so good at protecting us," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Another way you can encourage bacterial growth in your bottle is by putting anything other than fresh water in them. Drinks that nourish you also feed microbes – so any drinks containing sugar, for example, can stimulate the growth of any bacteria or mould present in your bottle, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Anything other than water is heaven for bacteria and fungi, especially protein shakes," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you've ever left milk in a glass for a few hours, you may have noticed that it leaves behind a thin film on the glass when you pour it away.

It is only when the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro818" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;bacteria turn pathogenic&lt;/a&gt; – in other words they pick up certain traits that make them harmful – that they make people ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Behnke and his colleagues also suggest using a dishwasher with a sanitisation cycle could be the most effective approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our guts are changing all the time, but there are over 1,000 species present in the gut so it's hard to shift in terms of composition," says Freestone. "There are too many variables to say, but getting food poisoning from the bacteria in a water bottle will never lead to a positive change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who've recently taken antibiotics that can affect their gut microbiome can also experience changes that leave them more vulnerable to other infections. One swab of a reusable water bottle taken at a newspaper office in the UK also revealed that these bottles can be a breeding ground for emerging strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mbo3.1023" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;discovered a bacterium called &lt;i id="klebsiella-grimontii" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Klebsiella grimontii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;– which is capable of forming biofilms on otherwise sterile surface –in the sample taken from the water bottle. While it can be found as part of the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, it can also cause severe diarrhoea in people who have recently taken antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's worth noting, however, there are no examples of severe illness that have been traced back to reusable water bottles in the scientific literature. This doesn't mean they don't happen, of course, as identifying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/205/11/1639/844906?redirectedFrom=fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;single point sources&lt;/a&gt; of infection is notoriously difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="how-should-we-clean-reusable-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="how-should-we-clean-reusable-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;How should we clean reusable bottles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For Behnke, it was the creeping sense that he should perhaps be cleaning his own water bottle more thoroughly that made him look closer at what could be inside it. He'd been using a filtered water bottle and had started to notice that the water he was drinking from it tasted bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Every now and then I would flush it with hot water, but never really did anything more than that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After his paper towel-based investigations revealed how manky his water bottle was, the study he and colleagues carried out went on to look at people's water bottle habits in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Behnke found that just over half of the 90 participants surveyed during the research said they share their bottle with others, and 15% said they never cleaned their bottles. Unsurprisingly, whether or not people rinsed or washed their water bottles affected the contamination level. However, Behnke found that how often they cleaned the bottles, or how they cleaned them, didn't enormously affect how contaminated the containers were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who washed their bottle with tools such as a brush or used a dishwasher tended to have the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lowest counts of bacteria inside&lt;/a&gt;.

The most hygienic bottles are simply those that are the easiest to clean, Freestone says. It's important, she adds, to ensure you clean every part of the water bottle, including the outside, the lid and straw, if it has one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, there may be another reason to opt for metal over plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Plastics usually have chemical additives that lend them their advantages: their flexibility, durability, heat-resistance and how lightweight they are," says Amit Abraham, assistant professor of clinical population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"These additives are physically bound to plastics, which means they can leach into the water," Abraham says,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whatever water bottle you opt for, it seems that good hygiene habits are fundamental to ensuring that the water you end up drinking isn't overflowing with harmful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZzZod0NHSWd0QUowOTZJOWV4XzctUldWY2RubjNqSjlQckZhTFNCdGltLVlxbmpkY3RBb1hCcUc0Q0x0SkJBSmJxeXZPZ1A1b2gteU1STHdNX25MWFJOOTZoU05BNmZicmswVlk3TU5RbTdkNUJhMGpBR0R1QktKLUR3UTZFQy1CcWFsUmQxbTRiczdzOENNYm1Yamx1WFg5cHFzcEVGZURiQmw5SzZuR04tOA</guid></item><item><title>6 Things Women Over 50 Should Do Every Day Before 9 A.M., According to Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNOFN4OV9pODM4QnFpNGd0RzZ6TzN6b1d1V3FkRzR0ZjBPMWRtTHVaT3JUeFRHRUdZcWZac2hELUp3WDYxVEw2b2VfQW9vaTZiS2ZsZm5nVm1aWWlCMml1Q2g5bTRaU3lZYjlkcVBHck5PcG9CSTVaQTBmbVNFeFRCVWNJMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stretching, drinking water, getting outside and eating breakfast are some habits that may help with healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These habits can help you maintain your health and independence in the decades to come. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for ways to improve your lifestyle that excite you and bring you joy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long gone are the days when celebrating 50 years around the sun was something to be feared. From changing careers to checking off places on their travel bucket lists, women across the globe are living their best lives beyond 50. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to thriving in—and well past—your 50s, a strong foundation built around a balanced diet, regular movement and mindfulness is key. “Don’t let your age define you! You can feel just as capable and energetic at 50 as you did at 30 as long as you take care of your body and manage stress. But, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920294/foods-to-eat-every-day-for-brain-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; are things that we need to start focusing on more as we age,” says registered dietitian &lt;a href="http://www.franceslargemanroth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth,&lt;/a&gt; a nutrition expert and author of &lt;em&gt;Everyday Snack Tray&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help keep your health at its best and embrace the decades to come, nutrition experts—all of whom are over 50—recommend doing these six things every morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-start-with-a-gentle-stretch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Start with a Gentle Stretch  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason mobility and flexibility training programs are on the rise. According to sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://activeeatingadvice.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Leslie Bonci, M.P.H., CSSD,&lt;/a&gt; owner of Active Eating Advice, “Stretching is important at all ages. Stretching for flexibility sets the stage for being protective of our supporting structure as we age. If we don’t use it, we lose it.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your fitness level, the type of mobility exercises you do—or how far you can lean into the stretch—may differ, but don’t let your current level of flexibility keep you from stretching. Research shows that a regular stretching routine can improve mobility and balance and reduce the risk of falls as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you follow a five-minute video on YouTube or try &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030090/best-stretches-for-better-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;this simple routine&lt;/a&gt;, set aside a few minutes each morning to warm up your body and reach for your toes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-hydrate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Hydrate  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you’re getting your coffee ready in the morning, make sure to drink at least one cup of water. Getting in the habit of staying hydrated in your 50s is crucial for aging well in your 60s, 70s and beyond. In fact, studies show that most older adults are not meeting their hydration needs, which can increase the risk of medical complications and lengthen hospital stays.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why hydrate first thing in the morning? “Starting the day with water restocks, restores and replenishes fluid levels, benefiting the body and brain. Hydration never takes a vacation and is important at all ages. Do not wait until later in the day to start drinking, as it can affect concentration levels over the day, making you feel more fatigued and less energetic,” says Bonci.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve had your H2O, feel free to grab that warm mug of coffee. “Now that I’m over 50, I feel extra good about my morning cup of joe. Not only does coffee help us feel alert and focused, it’s actually good for our brains. Research shows that caffeine intake is associated with the prevention of cognitive decline and can help lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and stroke,” says Largeman-Roth. In fact, a review confirmed this, finding that older adults who regularly consumed coffee were less likely to have negative physical outcomes, like limited mobility and age-related muscle loss, than non-coffee drinkers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-soak-up-some-sunshine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Soak Up Some Sunshine  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s something to be said about starting your day with a breath of fresh air, especially if it’s sunny out. Research shows that regular sun exposure is beneficial for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D production&lt;/a&gt;, regulating your circadian rhythm and improving your mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even when weather isn’t in your favor, getting outside—and leaving your phone on the nightstand—can go a long way in boosting your mood and reducing stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Every morning I wake up early to walk my dogs and leave my phone at home. I go when the sun rises so I can be in the moment, appreciate nature and focus on the positivity in my life. Whatever way you want to enjoy your moment, do it daily,” says &lt;a href="http://www.tobyamidornutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, an award-winning nutrition expert and author of &lt;em&gt;Health Shots&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-make-time-for-movement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Make Time for Movement  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the time you reach 50, perimenopause and menopause are on the horizon, if they haven’t already knocked on your door. Staying physically active is one of the best ways to maintain a healthy weight and support bone health during this phase of significant hormonal changes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To ensure that life stressors don’t get in the way of a workout, try scheduling your sweat session first thing in the morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you take your dogs for a long walk, boot up an online workout class or head to a local Pilates studio, it’s important to engage in moderate to vigorous exercise at least three times per week. Largeman-Roth agrees, saying, “On most mornings, I head to the basement for a spin class or a strength workout on the app. Keeping my heart healthy and my bones and muscles strong is important for my health and balance.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-eat-a-balanced-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Eat a Balanced Breakfast  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians unanimously agree on the power of a balanced breakfast to support your health, especially as you age. “I don’t have a large appetite in the morning, but [I] do make sure to get in protein and produce. Starting the day strong keeps us feeling fuller throughout the day. Plus, including fruits and veggies at breakfast helps to meet daily fiber goals, supporting the microbiome and overall gut health,” says Bonci.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast is also an important opportunity for getting key nutrients your body needs for healthy aging, like calcium, vitamin D and protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While mornings can be hectic, when possible, make a point to slow down and actually enjoy your A.M. meal. “I like eating breakfast and making time to sit down daily and enjoy it—even if it’s a bowl of cereal and milk topped with fruit. It’s a nice way to savor every bite and eat mindfully,” says Amidor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-meal-plan-for-better-brain--bone-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Meal-Plan for Better Brain &amp;amp; Bone Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strong bones and a sharp mind are key for a long and healthy life. Planning your meals first thing in the morning can help ensure you’re eating brain- and bone-supporting foods throughout the day. For example, salmon and walnuts are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 acids for brain health&lt;/a&gt;, while prunes contain minerals essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;. Largeman-Roth agrees, saying, “I eat a handful of prunes each morning to keep my bones strong and my gut healthy. I throw them into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-fruits-you-should-add-to-smoothies-8675944" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;smoothies &lt;/a&gt;and dice them up to add to yogurt or on top of oatmeal. They’re delicious and such an easy way to boost my health!” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Planning out your meals can also help you make more healthful choices and minimize mindless snacking—something that Amidor notes can be especially tricky during perimenopause, thanks to shifts in appetite. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition experts agree that focusing on a healthy lifestyle is key for maintaining your health well into your 50s and beyond. Experts recommend adopting habits like stretching, soaking up sunlight, drinking water, planning your meals and sitting down to a balanced breakfast first thing in the morning to start your day off on the right foot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to exercise, diet and stress management, Amidor encourages you to explore what really lights your fire and excites you. “This is the time to find joy in your life—even the smallest things. So if cooking, running, eating a small treat or enjoying the sunrise brings you joy—then do it!” she says.

Two of the papers came from the lab of Pascal Geldsetzer at Stanford University. Analysing medical records from Britain and Australia, the researchers concluded that around a fifth of dementia diagnoses could be averted through the original shingles vaccine, which contains live varicella-zoster virus. Two other studies, one by &lt;small&gt;GSK&lt;/small&gt;, a pharmaceutical company, and another by a group of academics in Britain, also reported that a newer “recombinant” vaccine, which is more effective at preventing shingles than the live version, appeared to confer even greater protection against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:56:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPbUZqMnVaczFSaFhMN1hvY20xMXFPT2VwOEhxaU0tZWpWM2sza1pfTGpOcEpoS0RwU0ozZ3lWR3FyOXBhb3dRaEQ4d2diTHlIWXRJQU94R1hBWVpQeVlZV3NyVDA3MFZ1bXZDV0c5ZnhFLTBFVHJFbU5WQlBHUVZaVFhsSkt5QXBCb3NPQ2o2ZHozbEE</guid></item><item><title>Do You Wake Up Between 2-3 Am Every Night?

                                        &lt;p&gt;Dr Eric Berg, a renowned health expert, is advising people who consistently wake up between 2-3 am to consult a doctor, as this could be a sign of an underlying health issue. In a recent video on his YouTube channel, which has over 13 million subscribers, Dr Berg explains that cortisol levels, triggered by stress, typically drop to their lowest point around 2 am. However, if cortisol spikes instead, it can disrupt sleep patterns and cause nocturnal awakenings, potentially impacting daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's unique about 2 am is something called the circadian rhythm with cortisol. Cortisol should be at the lowest point in this rhythm at 2 am and the highest point at 8 am. For me everything was backwards I was very awake at 2 am, but I was extremely tired at 8am. I tried everything, I even tried prescription medications, but it didn't work. What I didn't know at the time was those medications worsen and raise your cortisol," he explained in the video shared on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the video here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg suggested that magnesium can help regulate cortisol levels and alleviate stress. He further emphasised the importance of consulting a medical professional if magnesium deficiency is suspected, as it can disrupt both cortisol balance and sleep patterns. Sharing his personal experience with sleep struggles, Dr Berg highlighted the potential benefits of addressing magnesium levels to promote better rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that magnesium can help lower cortisol levels, and research supports this claim. Notably, a magnesium deficiency can lead to increased cortisol levels, making it more difficult to manage stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium also plays a crucial role in muscle relaxation, which can be disrupted by high cortisol levels. Additionally, magnesium is involved in regulating the nervous system, potentially leading to a calmer response to stress. However, a closer examination of the research reveals mixed findings, indicating a need for further studies to fully understand the relationship between magnesium, cortisol, and stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're watching right now and you have any tightness in your muscles - your upper back, lower back or if you point your toe and it cramps - that's a sure sign that you are deficient in magnesium. The type of magnesium that I would recommend taking is something called magnesium glycinate. It can help relax your muscles and reduce cortisol," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor recommended taking magnesium at night before bed. He explained that magnesium levels in the body's tissues are typically at their lowest around 6 am, which may contribute to the increased occurrence of health issues like heart attacks, strokes, and restless leg syndrome during the early morning hours, as these conditions are influenced by magnesium levels.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico have led to &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/measles-cases-are-still-rising-in-texas-heres-what-you-should-know-about-the-contagious-virus/" class="content-link"&gt;nearly 300 cases&lt;/a&gt; and two deaths, raising public health concerns. Isolated cases have also been reported in a number of states, including Washington. Public Health — Seattle &amp;amp; King County last month &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/king-county-confirms-measles-case-public-warned-of-possible-exposure/" class="content-link"&gt;confirmed a case of measles in an infant&lt;/a&gt; who had traveled abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases come as public health experts have been increasingly concerned with falling childhood vaccination rates in the past several years, and of a growing anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the Washington State Department of Health shows that in 36 of the state’s 39 counties, the rate of vaccination against measles among kindergarten students fell from the 2019-20 to the 2023-24 school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindergartners are required to be fully vaccinated against measles through the MMR vaccine before school begins, though &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/schools/immunization" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;state law&lt;/a&gt; allows parents or guardians to claim exemptions for religious or medical reasons. The kindergarten vaccination rate has declined across Washington, and quite sharply in some counties. And in the 2023-24 school year, kindergartners in only one Washington county met the herd-immunity threshold for measles of a 95% vaccination rate. Herd immunity occurs when the rate of vaccinations is high enough to stop an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="graphics-gallery-embed-1815355635" class="graphics-gallery-container mv-4 u-border-b u-border-t u-border-light-gray pv-3 column-width-embed graphics-gallery__captions-disabled"&gt;
      &lt;p class="graphics-gallery__headline h3 u-sans u-bold mh-auto"&gt;Measles vaccination rates down across WA&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="graphics-gallery__subhead u-sans mb-2 mh-auto"&gt;In 36 of Washington’s 39 counties, the rate of kindergartners vaccinated for measles declined from the 2019-20 to the 2023-24 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
      


      
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus, and it doesn’t take much for the spread of the disease to spiral out of control. Fortunately, the measles vaccine is effective at preventing disease, and it also provides long-lasting immunity. The vaccine is given in two shots, the first when the child is 12-15 months old, and the second at 4-6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was among the counties where the measles vaccination rate dropped. In the 2023-24 school year, the most recent data available, around 20,500 of the 22,200 kindergartners had received both doses of the measles vaccine, for a rate of 92.2%. That figure has gradually declined since the 2019-20 school year, when it was above the herd-immunity threshold, at 95.6%. King County fell below the 95% mark in the 2021-2022 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 1,700 kindergartners in King County listed as not vaccinated against measles in the previous school year, the majority (64%) were out of compliance, meaning they hadn’t submitted proof of vaccination and hadn’t received an exemption. While 30% had received religious exemptions or religious membership exemptions and 2% had medical exemptions. Around 4% had conditional status, meaning they intended to complete the vaccination requirement but had not done so yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the school districts wholly in King County, Enumclaw had the lowest rate of kindergarten measles vaccine completions in the 2023-24 school year, at 83.9%. Vashon Island, which has &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/vashons-parents-try-to-get-along-despite-deep-vaccination-divide/" class="content-link"&gt;long been known&lt;/a&gt; for its low rate of vaccinations, was second lowest, 84.3%, followed by Tukwila at 86.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mercer Island School District had the highest rate of kindergarten measles vaccinations in the past school year, at 97.3%, followed by Shoreline at 97.2% and Lake Washington at 96.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle Public Schools was below the 95% herd-immunity threshold at 93.1%. Seattle fell below the 95% mark in the 2021-22 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination rates have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;fallen sharply&lt;/a&gt; in nearly every state since 2020. The decline has been linked to fallout from the pandemic, such as health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine and a decline in trust of public-health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest decline in kindergarten measles vaccinations among Washington counties was in rural Pend Oreille, in the northeast corner of the state, where the rate fell from 95.1% to 80% — a remarkable 15.1 percentage-point drop. Other large declines were in Pacific County, down 14 points, and Columbia County, down 12.9 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two counties increased their rate of measles vaccine completions among kindergarten students from 2019-20 to 2023-24. Ferry County, in northeastern Washington, had the biggest jump, up 2.2 points. Even so, it still only had an 86.7% measles vaccination rate in the past school year. San Juan County had a small increase of less than one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data wasn’t available for the 2019-20 school year for Wahkiakum County. According to the Department of Health, of the two schools in the county, one failed to report immunization numbers that year, and the other reported numbers with inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yakima County had the highest rate of kindergarten measles vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, at 96.4%. It was, in fact, the only county where the rate exceeded the 95% herd-immunity threshold. That’s a big change from the 2019-20 school year, when 14 counties were above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevens County, in northeastern Washington, had the lowest rate of measles vaccinations among kindergartners, at 76.9%, and was one of two counties where the rate was below 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other was Jefferson County, where Port Townsend is located, with a rate of 79.2% in the last school year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Most kids recover from measles. But the virus can be deadly and can erase the immune system's memory.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico is now close to 300 reported cases, surpassing the total number of cases in all of the U.S. in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt; is happening in remote, rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There have been a few isolated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases reported in 13 other states &lt;/a&gt; — not related to the Texas outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nationwide risk remains low and that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination is the key to prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, doctors say it's a good time to remember how dangerous and long-lasting the health consequences of measles can be.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www2.phs.org/providers/alexandria-cvijanovich/2070089" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Cvijanovich&lt;/a&gt; has been a practicing pediatrician for more than 20 years. She says she's still haunted by the memory of a teenage boy she treated at the start of her career in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The boy had contracted measles as a 7-month-old, when he was too young to be vaccinated. "He got the virus from a child in his neighborhood who was unvaccinated," says Cvijanovich, who now practices in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was a relatively mild case of measles, and the infant recovered. She says he grew up to be a healthy, bright kid — an honor student.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then in middle school, he started to develop troubling symptoms. "He started getting lost between classes, lost like he couldn't find what class to go to next," Cvijanovich says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Worried, the teen's parents took him to a series of doctors to figure out what was wrong, until a pediatric neurologist finally suspected a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE&lt;/a&gt;. It's a degenerative neurological condition that typically develops seven to 10 years after a measles infection. It is almost always fatal. Cvijanovich was part of the hospital team that confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is that there is no treatment for it," she says. "And he basically became more and more incapacitated over time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some 18 months after his initial diagnosis, she says, the teenager died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;SSPE was once considered quite rare. But Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City who wrote&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt; a history of measles,&lt;/a&gt; says data from outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several decades suggests that may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It turns out that in some age groups, especially in kids under about age 2, it's much more common than we thought," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a review of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/2/226/3106340" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases in California&lt;/a&gt; found that, between 1988 and 1991, SSPE cases occurred as frequently as 1 in every 1,367 cases in unvaccinated children under age 5.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another study that looked at U.S. outbreaks between 1989 and 1991 put the rate of SSPE at roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235165/" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 4,600 &lt;/a&gt;measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination prevents not just SSPE, but also other serious complications that measles can cause — including pneumonia and severe brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there's a common consequence from measles infection you might not know of: It can erase your immune memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Not only does your brain have a memory, but your immune system has a memory of all the pathogens it's encountered in the past," says &lt;a href="https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/stephen-j-elledge" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Elledge&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the genetics department at Harvard Medical School who studies how the immune system responds to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Elledge says your immune system holds on to those memories, so the next time it encounters a virus, it knows how to fight it. But measles can destroy the cells that retain those memories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And when you lose that memory, then you're no longer immune to that particular pathogen," he says. "So the next time you get it, you've got to fight that battle all over again."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This effect is called immune amnesia. Elledge says it happens to some extent with every measles infection, though its severity varies widely. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So whenever you get measles, you lose some of your immune memory. And the more severe your case of measles is, the longer it lasts, the more of your immune system is destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/31/775081827/measles-virus-may-wipe-out-immune-protection-for-other-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, Elledge and his colleagues found that unvaccinated children had lost between 11% and 73% of their antibodies, which recognize and neutralize viruses and bacteria.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Other research suggests it can take &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;two to three years&lt;/a&gt; for the immune system to recover. And in the meantime, kids might be left vulnerable to infection from other diseases, including ones they had previously been immune to.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say immune amnesia helps explain one phenomenon that was documented after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s: Deaths from other childhood diseases &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/07/404963436/scientists-crack-a-50-year-old-mystery-about-the-measles-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;dropped dramatically&lt;/a&gt;. Even deaths from diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea were cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ratner says as routine childhood vaccination rates fall, the U.S. is likely to see more and larger measles outbreaks. "There's no doubt that we will in the future see the long-term consequences of measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he says we have a safe and powerful tool to prevent those consequences — vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Aged in his 70s, the man was infected while holidaying in the Murrumbidgee region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This follows the death of another man in his 70s in Sydney last month, after holidaying in the same region in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus has also been detected for the first time in &lt;a href="/topic/mosquitoes"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; collected in Brisbane’s eastern suburbs, Queensland health authorities confirmed on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mosquito activity expected to increase thanks to flooding rains brought by Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, it’s important to protect yourself from mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Japanese encephalitis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious &lt;a href="/topic/diseases"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; that spreads via mosquitoes, with around 68,000 cases annually across Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is thought to be maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes and waterbirds. Mosquitoes are infected when they feed from an infected waterbird. They then pass the virus to other waterbirds. Sometimes other animals, and people, can be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs are also a host, and the virus has spread through commercial piggeries in Victoria, NSW and Queensland. (But it poses no food safety risk.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feral pigs and other animals can also play a role in transmission cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 eeRWaN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/10/7/40/Ex-Tropical-Cyclone-Alfred-Brings-Severe-Weather-To-Australias-East-Coast-9wfabpsn.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/10/7/40/Ex-Tropical-Cyclone-Alfred-Brings-Severe-Weather-To-Australias-East-Coast-9wfabpsn.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/10/7/40/Ex-Tropical-Cyclone-Alfred-Brings-Severe-Weather-To-Australias-East-Coast-9wfabpsn.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious diseases that spreads via mosquitoes" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-29572"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious diseases that spreads via mosquitoes&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people infected show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with mild cases may have a fever, headache and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases – about one in 250 people infected – people may have neck stiffness, disorientation, drowsiness and seizures. Serious illness can have life-long neurological complications and, in some cases, the infection can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When did Japanese encephalitis get to Australia and why is it in Brisbane?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis had occurred in the Torres Strait during the 1990s. The virus was also detected in the Cape York Peninsula in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been no evidence of activity on the mainland since 2004 but everything changed in the summer of 2021–22. Japanese encephalitis virus was detected in commercial piggeries in southeastern Australia during that summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompted the declaration of a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance. At the time, flooding accompanying the La Niña-dominated weather patterns and a resulting boom in mosquito numbers, and waterbird populations, was thought responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has spread in subsequent years and has been detected in the mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs as well as detection in feral pigs and commercial piggeries in most states and territories. Only Tasmania has remained free of Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases of infection have also been reported. There were more than 50 cases of disease and seven deaths in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of Japanese encephalitis have already been reported from Queensland in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to concern about Japanese encephalitis virus and other mosquito-borne pathogens, health authorities around Australia have expanded and enhanced their surveillance programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, this includes mosquito monitoring at a number of locations, including urban areas of southeast Queensland. Mosquitoes collected in this monitoring program tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, promoting the current health warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is its detection in Brisbane important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to now, scientists have thought the risk of Japanese encephalitis was likely greatest following seasons of above-average rainfall or flooding. This provides ideal conditions for waterbirds and mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the activity of Japanese encephalitis virus over the summer of 2024–25 has taken many scientists by surprise. Before Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred arrived, there had been somewhat dry conditions with less waterbird activity and low mosquito numbers in many regions of eastern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However there has still been widespread Japanese encephalitis virus activity in Victoria, NSW and Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, Japanese encephalitis virus activity hasn’t extended to the coastal regions of southeast Queensland. The detection of the virus in suburban Brisbane may require authorities to rethink exactly where the virus may turn up next. Authorities are ramping up their surveillance to see just how widespread the virus is in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities and scientists are also trying to understand how the virus moved from western areas of the state to the coast and what drives virus transmission in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no evidence the virus is active in coastal regions of northern NSW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to reduce the risk of Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cover up with long-sleeved shirts and long pants for a physical barrier against mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use topical insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Be sure to apply an even coat on all exposed areas of skin for the longest-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure any insect screens on houses, tents and caravans are in good repair and reduce the amount of standing water in the backyard. The more water there is around your home, the more opportunities for mosquitoes there are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A safe and effective vaccine is available against Japanese encephalitis. Each state and territory health authority (for example Queensland, NSW, Victoria) have specific recommendations about access to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may take many weeks following vaccination to achieve sufficient protection, so prioritise reducing your exposure to bites in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameron Webb is Clinical Associate Professor and Principal Hospital Scientist, University of Sydney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew van den Hurk is a Medical Entomologist, The University of Queensland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/the-university-of-queensland-805"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/japanese-encephalitis-has-claimed-a-second-life-in-nsw-and-been-detected-in-brisbane-what-is-it-252373#:~:text=What%20is%20Japanese%20encephalitis%20virus,cycle%20between%20mosquitoes%20and%20waterbirds."&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the original article &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQandxWUFNdVZBN2xrTFZEdGhhYUtxYW1UdndIb2NQdnY5Q0dCNEM0WUxKX1JteUVNejQyTWlnZ2Uwa0MzQ3hZR21yREEta1BONTBBMl8tczU3enBPekkyV2xQM2F6V3hpRnNIaFRFbnV4Q3RTQ3VrR1llcmttakx3a0JWS1doZGNuLVUwZ2RpbHQ4V0NLanpvSnlPcGdWaFRoNWNFUmhVYw</guid></item><item><title>Families are asking doctors if kids can get the measles vaccine ahead of schedule.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; children get the first dose of the MMR vaccine, which includes protection against measles, mumps, and rubella, when they are between 12 and 15 months old. The second dose is given when children are between the ages 4 and 6. Recently, parents have been asking if their kids can get the first shot before they turn 1 or the second shot before they’re 4, pediatricians said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our nurses are being inundated with calls from families,” said Pring, who is also a pediatrician at a clinic in Boston and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Somerville resident and mom Emily Hwang got her 2-year-old daughter her first measles vaccine when she was 1, on the recommended schedule. But the recent outbreak of measles led Hwang to get her daughter the second dose two years early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I contacted my pediatrician and asked, with the measles epidemic happening now, should I be doing something?” Hwang said. She added, “The doctor said it was safe for her to get a second one, and she recommended it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite the surge in cases, experts said they still advise parents to vaccinate children on the CDC schedule unless they are traveling to areas with outbreaks. If parents do decide to give their kids the first vaccine dose before they turn 1, it would offer temporary protection but wouldn’t count toward the two-vaccine series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That’s because before the age of one, a child’s immune system is still developing, and a shot given that early isn’t considered sufficient to provide long-term protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A truly early dose is between 6 and 11 months, but we’re not recommending that unless someone is going to an area with an outbreak,” said Dr. Vandana Madhavan, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and primary care pediatrician at Mass General Hospital for Children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Shirley Huang, chief of general pediatrics at Tufts Medical Center, said questions about early vaccination are increasingly coming from families who aren’t traveling but are still concerned about exposure at day care or from people coming to visit from other states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Amy asked that her last name not be used for privacy reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We travel a decent amount, and we weighed the costs and benefits, and it seemed like the right move to get it now and get that protection for our little one,” she said. Her 3-year-old got her first vaccine on schedule, and because it offers significant protection, Amy said the family isn’t as concerned about her getting her second shot early but still wants to ask her pediatrician about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The first dose provides 93 percent protection from measles; the second dose boosts measles protection to 97 percent, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It doesn’t feel super likely [that they’ll get measles], but it also feels like the risk and the potential downsides are just so high that it feels like an easy thing to do to reduce that risk from nothing to zero,” Amy said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The second vaccine can be administered 28 days after the first dose, when the first dose is given after the age of 1. But the CDC recommends that it be given at 4 years old, because at that point, kids can receive a combined vaccine for MMR and varicella, or chicken pox.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Historically, it’s been at age 4 just to capture multiple different vaccines so we’re not piecemeal giving, ‘Here’s this booster at 3, here’s a booster at 3 1/2, etc,' and just doing a 4-year visit for a combination of vaccines,” Madhavan said, adding that that age also coincides with when a child is likely to need other vaccinations to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/school-immunizations" target="_blank"&gt;start kindergarten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/vacopt-faqs-hcp.html#:~:text=Unless%20the%20parent%20or%20caregiver%20expresses%20a%20preference%20for%20MMRV%20vaccine%2C%20CDC%20recommends%20that%20MMR%20vaccine%20and%20varicella%20vaccine%20should%20be%20administered%20for%20the%20first%20dose%20in%20this%20age%20group." target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; a child’s first MMR dose be given with a varicella vaccine, though separately and at different injection sites, Pring said. For the second dose, parents can choose between a child receiving one shot that protects against both MMR and varicella, or MMRV, or receiving the two vaccines separately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We typically don’t [give the combination vaccine] to infants and young toddlers because of a higher rate of fevers and seizures with the combination vaccine,” Madhavan said. Still, the risk of febrile seizure — a seizure caused by a high fever — is only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/vacopt-faqs-hcp.html#:~:text=Review%20of%20findings%20from%20both,uncommon%20after%20age%204%20years." target="_blank"&gt;0.08 percent&lt;/a&gt; in children age 12-23 months old when they receive a combination vaccine.

Her character drifts through scenes in a daze, caught between sleep and wakefulness, her oversized sunglasses and bright smile masking the growing dependency beneath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Though fictional, Ratliff’s story mirrors a harsh reality. In recent years, addiction to anti-anxiety medications such as Valium, Klonopin, and lorazepam (sold in Israel as Lorivan) has become a global concern, transcending age, class, and geography. What often starts as a "harmless pill for relaxation" can quickly spiral into dependence, making withdrawal a daunting challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="49epn-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="49epn-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The rise in prescription drug dependency highlights an alarming trend: an increasing reliance on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="ryiUtbViS2Jx" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bj2hz4liye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;medications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; to manage daily stressors. What begins as a short-term solution can become a chemical prison with devastating effects on mental and physical health. Why is quitting so difficult? How do people get hooked in the first place? And what can be done before the pills take over?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Chen Avni, a psychiatrist and deputy director of the psychiatric day treatment department at Ramat Hen Mental Health Center in Tel Aviv, explains that these medications belong to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. "They enhance the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that slows down brain activity. In low doses, they induce relaxation, but in higher doses, they can cause drowsiness, memory impairment, confusion, and loss of balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While the effects are similar to alcohol, benzodiazepines lack the intoxicating high. However, prolonged use can lead to cognitive impairment, decreased alertness, and, in elderly patients, an increased risk of dangerous falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Avni, addiction often develops when usage extends beyond the prescribed timeframe. "Initially, these medications are intended for short-term relief—typically no more than six weeks," he says. "The problem arises when patients feel they can’t function without them. That’s when we see cases of dependency, sometimes at alarmingly high doses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="b89et-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b89et-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b89et-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Shahar Cohen, a clinical social worker specializing in addiction treatment, has seen this trend intensify. "Anxiety levels across the population have been rising, especially in the past year and a half," she says. "This isn’t just an individual issue—it affects families, workplaces, and entire communities."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="lv4o-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;a id="Syh8YW4sBh1e" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bj2hz4liye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Prescription drug addiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2ptkd-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; cuts across all demographics. Some users first receive medication for legitimate issues like insomnia or acute anxiety. Others turn to them following major life stressors such as job loss, divorce, or a child's military enlistment. In many cases, what starts as a doctor-prescribed solution escalates into self-medication, leading to dependency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="28nie-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="28nie-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="28nie-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For many, obtaining benzodiazepines legally isn’t enough. "One former patient of mine was using 16 times the recommended dose," Avni recalls. "He bought part of his supply through his healthcare provider and the rest on the black market."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This underground trade of prescription medication underscores a major challenge: when patients become addicted, they will go to great lengths to maintain their supply. "People often don’t realize they’re dependent until it’s too late," Cohen warns. "When the thought of being without the drug becomes unbearable, that’s a red flag."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Experts emphasize that addiction must be treated holistically, addressing not just the physical dependency but also the underlying &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="SyT8Y114sr3Jx" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/r1ljgw11c0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;emotional triggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;. "Addiction is never just about the drug," Cohen explains. "It’s often about pain—whether emotional or psychological. The drug becomes a coping mechanism."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For those struggling with benzodiazepine dependency, gradual withdrawal under medical supervision is crucial. "Abrupt discontinuation can be dangerous, leading to severe withdrawal symptoms like seizures and psychosis," Avni cautions. "I’m currently treating a patient who experienced vivid hallucinations after trying to quit cold turkey. We had to introduce a slow, controlled tapering process."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="7nes1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Beyond physical detoxification, long-term recovery requires psychological support. "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective tool, especially for sleep disorders," Avni says. "For chronic anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, alternative psychiatric treatments that are non-addictive should be considered."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Awareness around prescription drug dependency is growing, but change is slow. "There are still doctors who hesitate to confront addicted patients and continue writing prescriptions out of convenience or pressure," Avni notes. "But every physician prescribing these drugs should recognize the long-term risks. This isn't just a temporary fix—it can become a lifelong struggle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The Israeli Health Ministry is currently working on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="H1xDYW4or2yg" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjth2nhxh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;reforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; to address prescription drug addiction, including establishing specialized treatment clinics within health maintenance organizations (HMOs). These initiatives aim to provide better oversight, education, and intervention before patients spiral into dependency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ultimately, the best way to combat prescription drug addiction is prevention. "It’s crucial to start with the lowest effective dose and treat the root cause of the anxiety, insomnia, or distress," Avni advises. "No one is immune to addiction. The key is to monitor usage, avoid increasing dosages without medical guidance, and seek alternative therapies when possible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="e8a1a-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e8a1a-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e8a1a-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Cohen echoes this sentiment. "Science still can’t predict who will become addicted and who won’t, so awareness is critical," she says. "If you suspect dependence—whether in yourself or someone close to you—don’t ignore it. Seeking help early can make all the difference."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="fltml-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fltml-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fltml-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Victoria Ratliff’s story may be fictional, but the crisis it highlights is very real. For countless individuals, the journey from prescription to addiction is deceptively short. The challenge now is ensuring that those in need receive the right treatment—before their escape becomes their prison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:55:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5maEhJQkk0VG5fdm10RldRUDZBMUpYVU1wVk50Zm56bm95ZDRUVjhKVWg4cTF2dGpUQjFlcVRLUkNTVFhmdmhCbW9PaTFrRVc1THM1VkM4aUkzV1NRSmFZbzFWbjVvWFlkR3c</guid></item><item><title>Cocaine laced with fentanyl suspected in Staten Island ER visits, doc warns - SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="65TOQDJPSZESPMZOLGHG7QXFEM"&gt;STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — While the number of drug overdose deaths appears to be down on Staten Island at the start of the year, District Attorney Michael E.

                The American Psychological Association has a new guide to helping teens be smarter viewers of online content.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Managing screen time is an issue that defines modern parenthood. Teenagers — who often don't want to be managed in any way — present an extra set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many parents know that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/25/1171773181/social-media-teens-mental-health" target="_blank"&gt;too much screen time is harmful &lt;/a&gt;for teenagers and they don't want their kids encountering unhealthy or dangerous content. But figuring out exactly how to provide guardrails to prevent these behaviors is hard. &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/8-18-census-integrated-report-final-web_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Research from Common Sense Media &lt;/a&gt;shows teenage screen time spiked during the pandemic; tweens averaged more than five hours a day and teenagers more than eight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents are yearning for guidance," says Lauren Salem, a mom of four kids who span tween and teen years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think there's a lot of big picture guidance but really there's a kind of disconnect between — I get what I'm supposed to do, I get what we're supposed to be aware of — but how do we actually incorporate it in our life and family," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While there is no panacea or easy set of rules for managing screens, researchers at the American Psychological Association (APA) say there are some useful strategies. The organization recently issued&lt;a href="https://healthyviewing.apa.org/" target="_blank"&gt; this guide for parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" We really want parents to feel like — rather than throw up their hands and feel like it's totally impossible to monitor everything — give them some tools," says Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the APA.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advice for  teens is different than for younger children. Here are some things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Understand the digital landscape and the teenage brain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single family I work with struggles with screens," says Kent Toussaint, a therapist who founded the &lt;a href="https://teentherapycenter.com/about-us/staff/kent-toussaint/" target="_blank"&gt;Teen Therapy Center i&lt;/a&gt;n Los Angeles and was not involved in this report. " I think a lot of times parents think that kids can self-regulate this and most kids cannot."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers who worked on the new report stress that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/17/1176452284/teens-social-media-phone-habit" target="_blank"&gt;teenage brains are ill-equipped&lt;/a&gt; to navigate today's digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"During the teen years, the brain's reward centers are especially sensitive, while the parts that regulate self-control are still developing," the report states. Teen brains are also extra sensitive to peer and social influence; this combination of factors makes it difficult for teens to disengage with platforms that are often designed to engage them and keep them engaged.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;  2. Promote healthy viewing habits &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/healthy-teen-video-viewing" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that kids who are frequently exposed to content that includes depictions of things like aggressive behavior, bullying or hostile language can become less empathetic. Some content can promote things like self-harm or substance use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say it's important to help kids learn how to identify these negative behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Encourage conversations about how different types of content make them feel," the report guidelines suggest. Drawing attention to their feelings helps teens build their own critical thinking skills when it comes to evaluating content.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report points out that not all screen time is bad. Exposure to prosocial behaviors can help kids cultivate kindness. Teens need to learn to see these patterns themselves, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Help them become critical thinkers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No parent can sit next to their child every minute that they're watching screens, of course. But Prinstein advises parents to spend time with their child watching content — even if it's short — and have a conversation about it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Focus on the nature of the content rather than getting caught up in keeping track of every video service," advise the authors. "Ask curious, non-judgmental questions about what your teen enjoys watching."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another suggestion is to work together to develop strategies for evaluating content thoughtfully. Kids don't like to be manipulated and can be receptive when parents initiate conversations about advertising, Prinstein says. He suggests pointing out things like the way ads are targeted based on viewing habits. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Or help them to identify sponsored content, even when it's subtly integrated into videos. Discuss how influencers build their audiences and what goes into creating their content, he advises.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Above all, stay engaged   &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often parents become overwhelmed, says Prinstein, but doing nothing when it comes to teens and screens is the worst possible thing. " When a parent's watching something with kids and something comes on screen that's not okay — maybe there's swearing, maybe there's explicit sex, maybe there's discrimination against others — parents might clam up at that point." If there's no discussion, Prinstein says "kids are more likely to assume that that means parents are a hundred percent okay with what they just saw."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while teens are known for pushing back on parents, therapist Kent Toussaint  stresses that the strength of the relationship between parent and child fundamentally influences a child's habits around any kind of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more we've invested in connecting and the relationship with our child, the more they're going to cooperate," he says. "The more they're going to work with us on our expectations."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is not to control your child, but to help them learn to exert some measure of self-control, even if it takes practice and is not perfect, Prinstein says. After all, this is a skill even adults struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "Sometimes modeling  that all of us are getting sucked in to doing this more than we want," he says, "is helpful."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250314_01.aspx"&gt;second man has died&lt;/a&gt; from Japanese encephalitis virus in New South Wales on March 6, the state’s health authorities confirmed on Friday. Aged in his 70s, the man was infected while holidaying in the Murrumbidgee region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows the death of &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250225_01.aspx"&gt;another man in his 70s&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney last month, after holidaying in the same region in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus has also been detected for the first time in &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/doh-media-releases/be-alert-against-mosquitoes-as-jev-detected-in-brisbane"&gt;mosquitoes collected in Brisbane’s eastern suburbs&lt;/a&gt;, Queensland health authorities confirmed on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With mosquito activity expected to increase thanks to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/first-wind-then-rain-next-come-the-mozzies-heres-how-to-reduce-your-risk-of-bites-and-infections-251260"&gt;flooding rains brought by Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important to protect yourself from mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Japanese encephalitis virus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious diseases that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;spreads via mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, with around 68,000 cases annually across Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus is thought to be maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes and waterbirds. Mosquitoes are infected when they feed from an infected waterbird. They then pass the virus to other waterbirds. Sometimes other animals, and people, can be infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pigs are also a host, and the virus has spread through &lt;a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;commercial piggeries&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria, NSW and Queensland. (But it poses no food safety risk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feral pigs and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012510"&gt;other animals&lt;/a&gt; can also play &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/feral-pigs-japanese-encephalitis-queensland/104955158"&gt;a role in transmission cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people infected &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;show no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with mild cases may have a fever, headache and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases – &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;about one in 250 people infected&lt;/a&gt; – people may have neck stiffness, disorientation, drowsiness and seizures. Serious illness can have life-long neurological complications and, in some cases, the infection can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/japanese-encephalitis/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html"&gt;no specific treatment&lt;/a&gt; for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Scientists use specially designed traps to monitor changes in mosquito activity and collect specimens for further testing.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;A/Prof Cameron Webb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When did Japanese encephalitis get to Australia and why is it in Brisbane?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis had occurred in the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1996.tb124960.x"&gt;Torres Strait during the 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. The virus was also &lt;a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-1998-cdi2205-cdi2205d.htm"&gt;detected in the Cape York Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been no evidence of activity on the mainland since 2004 but everything changed in the &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2022.0037"&gt;summer of 2021–22&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese encephalitis virus was &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/japanese-encephalitis-virus-has-been-detected-in-australian-pigs-can-mozzies-now-spread-it-to-humans-178017"&gt;detected in commercial piggeries&lt;/a&gt; in southeastern Australia during that summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prompted the declaration of a &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, flooding accompanying the La Niña-dominated weather patterns and a resulting boom in mosquito numbers, and waterbird populations, was thought responsible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus has spread in subsequent years and has been detected in the mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs as well as detection in feral pigs and commercial piggeries in most states and territories. Only &lt;a href="https://www.health.tas.gov.au/publications/japanese-encephalitis-virus"&gt;Tasmania has remained free&lt;/a&gt; of Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human cases of infection have also been reported. There were more than 50 cases of disease and &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/statement-on-the-end-of-japanese-encephalitis-virus-emergency-response"&gt;seven deaths in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mosquitoes collected in the local environment can be returned to the laboratory and tested for the presence of viruses.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;A/Prof Cameron Webb (NSW Health Pathology)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases of Japanese encephalitis have &lt;a href="https://www.darlingdowns.health.qld.gov.au/about-us/our-stories/news/avoid-the-bite-of-mosquitoes-as-new-cases-of-japanese-encephalitis-virus-detected"&gt;already been reported from Queensland in 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to concern about Japanese encephalitis virus and other mosquito-borne pathogens, health authorities around Australia have expanded and enhanced their surveillance programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, this includes mosquito monitoring at a number of locations, including urban areas of southeast Queensland. Mosquitoes collected in this monitoring program tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, promoting the current health warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is its detection in Brisbane important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, scientists have thought the risk of Japanese encephalitis was likely greatest following seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000861"&gt;above-average rainfall or flooding&lt;/a&gt;. This provides ideal conditions for waterbirds and mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the activity of Japanese encephalitis virus over the summer of 2024–25 has taken many scientists by surprise. Before Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred arrived, there had been somewhat dry conditions with less waterbird activity and low mosquito numbers in many regions of eastern Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there has still been widespread Japanese encephalitis virus activity in &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-alerts/japanese-encephalitis-in-victoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20241207_00.aspx"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/doh-media-releases/queenslanders-urged-to-be-alert-against-mosquito-bites"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Japanese encephalitis virus activity hasn’t extended to the coastal regions of southeast Queensland. The detection of the virus in suburban Brisbane may require authorities to rethink exactly where the virus may turn up next. Authorities are ramping up their surveillance to see just how widespread the virus is in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health authorities and scientists are also trying to understand how the virus moved from western areas of the state to the coast and what drives virus transmission in different regions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/pests/vector/Pages/surveillance-and-monitoring-weekly-reports-season-2024-25.aspx"&gt;currently no evidence&lt;/a&gt; the virus is active in coastal regions of northern NSW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mosquitoes collected in Brisbane have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;A/Prof Cameron Webb (NSW Health Pathology)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can people do to protect themselves?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to reduce the risk of Japanese encephalitis virus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover up with long-sleeved shirts and long pants for a physical barrier against mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use topical insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Be sure to apply an even coat on all exposed areas of skin for the longest-lasting protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure any insect screens on houses, tents and caravans are in good repair and reduce the amount of standing water in the backyard. The more water there is around your home, the more opportunities for mosquitoes there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safe and effective vaccine is &lt;a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/contents/vaccine-preventable-diseases/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;available against Japanese encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;. Each state and territory health authority (for example &lt;a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/condition/infections-and-parasites/viral-infections/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/jev/Pages/vaccination.aspx"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;) have specific recommendations about access to vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may take many weeks following vaccination to achieve sufficient protection, so prioritise reducing your exposure to bites in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oats contain beta-glucan, a type of soluble fibre that helps lower cholesterol levels and supports heart health, says Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Family Life&lt;/em&gt;. “It forms a gel in the gut that binds to cholesterol, reducing its absorption and helping to remove it from the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while oat milk contains some beta-glucan, whole oats provide a more concentrated source when consumed in porridge or muesli or incorporated in other foods such as pancakes or smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the downsides?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst many agree that oat milk is the tastiest plant-based alternative, its nutritional profile leaves much to be desired. Oat milk is low in protein and contains more carbohydrates and added sugars than &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthiest-animal-milk-cow-horse-goat/"&gt;cow’s milk&lt;/a&gt; and its plant-based competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A splash of it in a hot drink, or consumed in moderation alongside foods high in protein or fibre, is unlikely to have a big effect. However it has a moderate glycemic index of around 60 (for reference, dairy milk is in the mid-30s) which means it causes a quicker spike in blood sugar compared to other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat milk contains added sugars as a result of processing the oats. The sugars are created when enzymes break down oat starches into simple carbohydrates. These pass into the bloodstream as glucose and can raise blood sugar levels. On average, a cup of oat milk contains around seven grams of added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed in higher volumes (think the daily oat milk latte) it can cause problems, especially for those with diabetes and other sensitivities, Hope explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I have oat milk in a drink, I tend to have half oat milk and half hot water. Then you’re not having so much because the sugars and calories can add up quickly,” Hope explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the fortified versions – where extra flavourings, thickeners, nutrients and oils are added in – are ultra-processed and can cause inflammation and bloating. This can disrupt the gut microbiome and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to read an oat milk label&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson says that fortified oat milks like Oatly contain added vitamins and minerals that make them a useful swap for cow’s milk. However, for those looking for an option with a minimal ingredient list, he suggests trying Plenish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their organic, unsweetened, gluten-free oat milk contains just water, oats, and sea salt. With 41 calories per 100ml, it is marketed as “preservative-free”, “seed oil-free”, and “UPF-free”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson adds: “If you are trying to avoid ultra-processed foods, then you might want to choose oat milks without stabilisers such as gellan gum or guar gum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these are additives that help to thicken the oat milk, improve its shelf life, and keep the ingredients suspended to avoid sediment compounding at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it tends to be that some of the cheaper oat milk options have longer ingredient lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If possible, I’d try to find one that has the basics of oats, water and sea salt and if you’re looking for a fortified version, one which contains vitamin D, B vitamins, calcium, and iodine,” Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who should avoid it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with coeliac disease or severe gluten sensitivities should consider avoiding oat milk as, even though some versions are marked gluten-free, there is still a cross-contamination risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetics and those with insulin resistance or other sensitivities might also consider opting for a different alternative due to its added sugar content. And whilst many oat milks are gluten free, those with coeliac disease or sensitivities should still take care as they may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with specific nutrition goals, such those who prioritise a high-protein diet might also consider opting for a different type of milk. “If you rely on milk for protein – whether you do a lot of resistance training, are an older adult, or are a vegan looking for higher-protein options – you may be better off choosing a plant milk such as soya, which has a protein content similar to cow’s milk,” Hobson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those following a low-carbohydrate diet or on a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/recipes-to-help-you-lose-weight-after-40/"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; journey might also opt for a lower-calorie, high protein option or an unsweetened oat milk which better aligns with their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the low protein content, it is not recommended for children younger than five to solely consume oat milk if they are able to drink dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What about the alternatives?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutritionally, I would put oat milk at the bottom of the list, compared to almond, soya, and dairy,” Hope says. “But taste-wise, I’d absolutely put it at the top.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy and soy milk both provide good levels of protein – with semi-skimmed cows milk containing 3.6g and soya providing 2.4g per 100ml. They are both also &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/calcium-diet/"&gt;rich in calcium&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, almond milk provides a lower-calorie option compared to its competitors with around 22 calories per 100ml. It has the highest calcium level of all the nut-based milks and is high in vitamin E, iron, and fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat milk has the highest glycemic index compared to almond, soy, and dairy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy, nutritionally, is going to be the best for us in terms of the micronutrients, the protein, and the calcium,” Hope says. She ranks soya in second place, followed by almond, and then finally oat milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Can you drink it every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it’s high in carbohydrates and calories, oat milk should be consumed in moderation which means it may not be a wise idea to start every day with a creamy oat milk latte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Starbucks grande oat latte is the most calorific of the various plant-based options, with around 184 calories, 9.1g of fat, 21g of carbohydrates, 10g of sugar, 3.3g of fibre and just 2.8g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a grande almond latte is the lowest calorie option at 82, the soya alternative contains a substantial 10.3g of protein, and the coconut option provides a good amount of fibre with 4.8g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not everything that we consume needs to be the healthiest thing for us, as long as we know where the food sits in our balanced diet,” Hope says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to be mistaken and think that oat milk is a super healthy drink, but it tastes great and I personally love an oat milk matcha. We just need to be aware of how much of it we’re consuming and how regularly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Is it really better than cow’s milk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk is naturally rich in B vitamins, iodine, calcium, and is higher in protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38871080/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted at the University of Minnesota in 2024 found that most plant-based alternatives do not deliver the same level of nutrition as cows milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team within the university’s Nutrition Coordinating Centre examined more than 200 plant-based alternatives and compared their nutritional profiles against each other and with cow’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Britain, if a farm suspects H5N1 – which is typically spread to poultry via the droppings of wild birds like waterfowl and shorebirds – it is legally required to notify the Department for Environment, Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the agency responsible for animal biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has telltale signs: birds develop swollen heads, twisted necks, breathing difficulties, body swelling, discoloured droppings, dragging legs, and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most birds die within a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to notify the authorities can result in an unlimited fine and a six-month prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After notification, government officials from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) are deployed within 24 hours to carry out laboratory testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the farm is put into lockdown – no birds, equipment, or farm vehicles are allowed to come or go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test results confirm H5N1, a culling or “depopulation order” is issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Huge’ financial implication bird flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only a small portion of birds are sick, the entire flock will be destroyed. Farmers are compensated for the great bulk of birds destroyed, with compensation payments averaging £160,000 per farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many argue they should be paid more, because compensation is based on the value of any healthy birds that must be culled to contain the virus and does not include the birds that have already died or are sick with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The financial implication of avian influenza is huge, and the emotional strain on affected farmers and their families is devastating, with many now forced to reconsider their future,” James Mottershead, the National Farmers Union poultry board chair, told &lt;em&gt;Poultry Weekly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several methods used in culling, which in Britain is carried out by government contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One method – heavily criticised by animal rights activists – is known as ventilation shutdown, and is one of the quickest and cheapest ways to kill hundreds of thousands of birds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves sealing off vents that keep the air in a packed poultry shed cool, causing the temperature to rise rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of around three hours, temperatures climb to around 70 degrees celsius – a consequence of the body heat produced by thousands of tightly packed birds – so that their core body temperature soars to a fatal level.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Telegraph</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPWlNQVXNUM3VkR2VmX3JfRFN2eFlGMjAzNWZ0ZFJWbEdTYUpLSEs5U1RvSFppQXhKY0JpYU1FNXNCZ0J4ZlQ4bThyN0c1ZWo3XzRtX1dJc2tFbnJUT0pMb2xGWC0wallLTkpVVi1aWjdrbDAwTnlJSTlHdk8wX19DelJ0cG50WWthT254YkJaZ2h3VmMydk9zOEw3VHVONmEwTUxlVmdkWU1LZFZLLS1NY1QxQ0V1X2NyWC1DOA</guid></item><item><title>A Hidden Compound in Rosemary Could Help Fight Alzheimer's - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQSGVLQ0tvWm1xbTBGaDdkZHVmWjFTeDdYUFVIbmFieWsxMTU1SzJiVWd3bDdDenV6M1pNNjFvdHNVMnVxM0hDSEhsd3RtUWlGZDBnN1RvTGZEVFRkLXUzR0MwNmU2WlBFdGZOaFMzWlA2dVNRMlYyN2x1Z25WZkVZR2phUWJKSlREYldNbnV6aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new approach to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease treatment could be on the horizon, inspired by a compound found in common herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosic_acid"&gt;Carnosic acid&lt;/a&gt; is found in rosemary and sage and is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, it is unstable in its pure form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now researchers in California have synthesized a stable derivative of the compound, which showed promising results in mouse models of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that were given the stable derivative had boosts in memory, more neuron synapses, reduced inflammation, and more removal of toxic proteins that are linked to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That covers multiple signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, which can kill off a high proportion of synapses, breaking key neuron communication routes, while memory loss is one of the most noticeable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155129" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity.jpg" alt="Mouse brains" class="wp-image-155129 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity-600x276.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155129" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microscopy images showing an Alzheimer's-like mouse brain (left), and a diAcCA-treated mouse brain (right), with more intense green colors showing more neuronal synapses. (&lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;Scripps Research&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Stuart Lipton, from the Scripps Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It didn't just slow down the decline, it improved virtually back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges faced by the researchers was getting carnosic acid into a stable form that would last long enough in the brain to have an effect. After extensive tests, they found a suitable &lt;span&gt;di-acetylated &lt;/span&gt;form (diAcCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut converts diAcCA to carnosic acid before it enters the bloodstream, where they found it has about 20 percent better absorption than pure carnosic acid. Once converted, the carnosic acid reached therapeutic levels in the brain within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice with a form of Alzheimer's were then given diAcCA or a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; three times a week for three months. The researchers looked at the effects on brain tissue and how well the mice did on exercises designed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-blood-test-identifies-alzheimers-memory-loss-with-90-accuracy"&gt;assess their memory&lt;/a&gt; and ability to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diAcCA compound didn't appear to have any toxic effects on the mice treated with it, and excessive buildups of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-finally-understand-how-the-tangled-proteins-in-dementia-cause-cells-to-die"&gt;proteins known to be signs of Alzheimer's damage&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By combating inflammation and oxidative stress with this diAcCA compound, we actually increased the number of synapses in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lipton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also took down other misfolded or aggregated proteins such as phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta, which are thought to trigger Alzheimer's disease and serve as biomarkers of the disease process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all very promising, although we're still at the early stages here.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to confirm that diAcCA has the same effects in human brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the anti-inflammatory properties of carnosic acid, which have also been recorded in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2016389"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, Lipton and his colleagues are hopeful that this same treatment could be used for other conditions linked to inflammation – from type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also potential for diAcCA drugs to be used alongside other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;treatments for Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; that are now available. As this compound is a modified form of carnosic acid – already known to be safe for consumption – the researchers are hoping new medications can be developed on an accelerated schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could make existing amyloid  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; treatments work better by taking away or limiting their side effects," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lipton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

My cardiologist prescribed metoprolol. At about the same time, I had reduced my intake of magnesium from about 50% of the daily value (DV) to 35%. (This may have preceded the bigeminy onset.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Quite by accident, I read an article recommending magnesium for a heart arrhythmia. Within a week or so of reading the article, I started magnesium gluconate at 100% of the DV. I have been taking this and metoprolol for about a month, and my condition has improved about 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The question is: How can we tell if the magnesium shorting down to 35% was actually the cause and increasing it to 100% was the cure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— L.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear L.R.:&lt;/strong&gt; Bigeminy, more precisely ventricular bigeminy, is a term most people probably haven't heard of, but most people have heard of a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). Ventricular bigeminy is when every other beat is a PVC and alternates with regular beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While this rhythm can happen in people without any heart disease or risk factors, your cardiologist will have considered many underlying causes, such as excess alcohol use, anemia, low oxygen levels, and thyroid disease. A beta blocker like metoprolol is usually the first drug that is used as beta blockers reduce adrenalin levels, reduce the oxygen needs of the heart, and are proven to be effective at reducing the number of PVCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A low magnesium level is another risk factor for PVCs and ventricular bigeminy, and there are case reports of the rhythm going away completely with magnesium. So, while we can't be sure whether your bigeminy was caused by a low magnesium level, the story is suggestive that it's a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I don't recommend taking magnesium except in people who have low levels, but 100% of the DV of magnesium is quite safe to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a 76-year-old female who weighs 112 pounds. I am 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and in good health. I walk 40 minutes to 1 hour over a very hilly course five days a week and do strength training two days a week. I was just diagnosed with osteoporosis, with my risk of a major osteoporosis fracture being 12.6% and my risk of a hip fracture being 3.8%, according to FRAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have Barrett's esophagus that is monitored every three years and take 20 mg of omeprazole for it. I also take 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily and try to eat a high-calcium diet. My only other medication is 50 mg of trazodone for sleep. I have no other medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My primary doctor wants to put me on medication for osteoporosis. Given my situation, which medication would you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— P.C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear P.C.:&lt;/strong&gt; The FRAX score is a way of combining a person's measured bone density with clinical risk factors like age, sex and weight to provide an estimate of the fracture risk. Most authorities recommend treatment when the risk of a major osteoporotic fracture is greater than 20% or the risk of a hip fracture is greater than 3%. Your primary doctor is following the published literature. (I will note that a revised calculator called the FRAXplus includes additional risk factors and can be found at www.FRAXplus.org/calculation-tool/.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Omeprazole, the medicine you take for Barrett's, protects your esophagus but can cause poor absorption of calcium, which may be an additional risk factor for you. Because of your Barrett's, the normal first-line treatments (oral bisphosphonates) are not recommended. Instead, intravenous bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid once a year are the standard recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Denosumab is another option, but people need to stay on this medication long-term because, unlike bisphosphonates, bone loss occurs rapidly after stopping it.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Detroit News</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 04:04:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQcDdYcWt2aTJjcWhsRFY3QzI1MDhlZ0JaQlp0VjByWDA4NFprZTdzNG10NHJBY0JLbm9TSlNVQkxHTzN4dlU0WHZZZkV4UWp4eFF4Vjh2ZmRmVWVDUnlKbE1hZ1prRURYUk5JUkZqSG1ZRVZQQnNwY1NJb3RiNEFRUVphenJlN2dJaWZEdEhaYy1JSFZzSVQ0UzVTMFJhUnVSRFI2REpPc0cwVlZIMXJXOWRsemxManlDcHJ3MDZobnVzbl8xbzdzRjcyMHVJZw</guid></item><item><title>Zoo animals offer promising venue to study brain disorders - The Transmitter: Neuroscience News and Perspectives</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAJBVV95cUxPT2ZLVjhIWEwxalFSRmU2R0c0UWNRc0lBeHVWTEVYRGRtbXZvT29KLUJsaWdPZG0tMnR0dzlnQ0dkRXB0S0lRQnpNZ0dhR1dSVHRSMlg3OHE3RExHZ3pTTWkyOUJ0UUFubVBlcVFfUXAweFBTZjFNODdhRk40V0hia1Q3MlQ5OHJ3c3BfSWRCdEJWYnJNRVlBWXdEZVhyU2E0UzNldlZwZ3JNcEhLQ0ZjOENlbVJMRjd6eUI4X2ZNcThSWC1hemRFclRqQ1RhaG1VRU5aNXlJM2I4MjJJQ0ZHNXBZYm9vaXFFTzlkZk40Y040N2pVTGVrb2M4UTR0N01NRjF4aQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="font-serif text-1sm text-dark-brown tracking-normal-lg lg:tracking-wide lg:text-3sm lg:leading-8"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neuroscience research relies overwhelmingly on a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05034-3" target="_blank"&gt;single model system&lt;/a&gt;—the mouse—to address human health challenges. Yet mice rarely replicate the complexity of human diseases, particularly in the brain, and treatments that show promise in mice often fail to translate effectively to people. Studying endangered animals in zoos could be a powerful approach to simultaneously improve animal welfare and advance human brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory experiments done in mice are valuable; they provide a highly controlled environment to uncover causal relationships between variables. But mice don’t often spontaneously develop a disease of interest, and genetically engineered mice in isolated labs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.006" target="_blank"&gt;fail to capture the environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; that can play a critical role in the development and manifestation of complex human diseases. We have invested heavily in the genetics of mouse models to study mental health, but those studies have revealed that gene variants often have a small impact on the etiology of many human mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harnessing biodiversity offers a new route to understand the complex interplay between genetics and environment in mental and other health issues and could simultaneously help improve the well-being of endangered animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="flex flex-col text-center text-red font-serif-text mt-5 mb-4 lg:my-12 lg:w-1/2 lg:ml-14 lg:-mr-52 lg:mt-16 lg:mb-6 lg:float-right lg:flex-row lg:flex-start lg:text-start"&gt;
    
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p class="font-light italic text-2sm p-0 lg:text-3md"&gt;
            Harnessing biodiversity offers a new route to understand the complex interplay between genetics and environment.        &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans and zoo animals, for example, share several health concerns. Many endangered zoo animals are sedentary, overweight and live relatively long lives. Some suffer from depression and anxiety—you might have seen a polar bear, panda or lion pacing back and forth in their enclosure at the zoo, an indicator of anxiety known as stereotypy. Indeed, many zoo animals are treated with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1638/2015-0146.1" target="_blank"&gt;same antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; commonly used to reduce depression and anxiety in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying how enclosure size, social interactions and exercise influence mental health in endangered species offers a new way to explore how specific environmental factors affect the brain, and it could identify concrete ways to improve conditions for zoo animals. For species with thousands of animals in captivity, such as tigers, we could harness big data to identify the interactions between genetic and environmental factors, such as stress and exercise, that underpin depressive or anxiety-like behaviors across multiple species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="first-letter:text-2xl first-letter:float-left first-letter:text-red first-letter:pr-2 pb-0"&gt;
    Z&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
oo animals also offer the opportunity to study brain health over the lifespan. As part of their medical care, some animals undergo MRIs for neurological checkups and diagnosis. And preliminary evidence suggests that aged zoo animals may experience brain structure and cognitive changes similar to those that occur with human aging; some veterinarians report cognitive impairment in old tigers (though there is no agreed-upon test to assess cognitive dysfunction in these animals), with one study reporting evidence of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2022.827870" target="_blank"&gt;brain atrophy in an 18-year-old tiger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Some species may even spontaneously recapitulate age-related diseases, making them valuable model systems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for household pets, such as cats and dogs. Because they are relatively long-lived and often receive regular veterinary care, they provide a particularly good opportunity to study age-related diseases. Like humans, some cats and dogs show signs of cognitive decline later in later life. And unlike mice, cats and dogs spontaneously develop brain plaques and tangles, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Because these animals naturally display age-related decline, treatments that prove effective in cats and dogs are more likely to translate to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a single species is unlikely to provide definitive answers for complex human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining insights from multiple systems and from different environments will be the best route to enhancing human and animal brain health—each species provides different and complementary insights into biomedical challenges. Successfully leveraging this information requires new tools for integrating information across species. Many model systems, including mice, cats and tigers, develop and age faster than humans. My team is expanding on a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(01)00171-3" target="_blank"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.translatingtime.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Translating Time&lt;/a&gt;, which enables the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5746-12.2013" target="_blank"&gt;alignment of ages&lt;/a&gt; across a variety of species. This tool helps scientists study how biological dysfunctions in model systems &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad230" target="_blank"&gt;map onto humans&lt;/a&gt; and how information from humans can be used to support animal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise of these approaches, funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health—as least as it currently stands—remains heavily focused on mouse models of disease. To truly understand how genetic predisposition and environmental influences interact to produce complex diseases, we need to study different species living in complex environments. Zoo and companion animals offer a ready setting to do this, but collecting large amounts of genetic and phenotypic information will require substantial investment and buy-in from the research community. Once we have these data in hand, machine-learning models can help process it and sort out which genes and environmental factors are important for healthy aging and disease progression. The outcomes will benefit both humans and animals—by identifying environmental factors that contribute to brain health and new avenues for treatment that are applicable to different species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because outbreaks primarily affect sub-Saharan Africa, pharmaceutical companies have lacked financial incentives to develop treatments, and the sporadic nature of outbreaks has made  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola#/media/File:Ebola_virus_virion.jpg"&gt;CDC/PD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're really trying to come up with something that was more practical, easier to use, that could be used to help prevent, control, and contain outbreaks," Thomas Geisbert, a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who led the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0659"&gt;new study published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their experiment, Geisbert and colleagues tested the antiviral Obeldesivir, the oral form of intravenous Remdesivir, originally developed for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeldesivir is a "polymerase inhibitor," meaning it blocks an enzyme crucial for viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with a high dose of the Makona variant of the Ebola virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after exposure, ten monkeys then received an Obeldesivir pill daily for ten days, while three control monkeys received no treatment and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeldesivir protected 80 percent of the cynomolgus macaques and 100 percent of the rhesus macaques, which are biologically closer to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug not only cleared the virus from the treated monkeys' blood but also triggered an immune response, helping them develop  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; while avoiding organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisbert explained that while the number of monkeys was relatively small, the study was statistically powerful because they were exposed to an extraordinarily high dose of the virus – roughly 30,000 times the lethal dose for humans. This reduced the need for additional control monkeys, limiting unnecessary animal deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher, who has worked on Ebola since the 1980s and is credited with discovering the Reston strain, said one of the most exciting aspects of Obeldesivir is its "broad-spectrum" protection, compared to the approved antibody treatments that only work against the Zaire species of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's a huge advantage," Geisbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical maker Gilead is currently advancing Obeldesivir to Phase 2 clinical trials for Marburg virus, a close relative of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisbert also emphasized the importance of funding from the US National Institutes of Health, amid reports that dozens of grants have been canceled under President Donald Trump's administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All these drugs and vaccines that were developed against Ebola and a lot of these exotic  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and pathogens – 90 percent of the money comes from the US government," he said, adding, "I think the general public would agree we need treatments for Ebola."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Simply looking at nature – or even just digital pictures of it – can relieve pain, according to new research which scanned the brains of people receiving electrical shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature's many health benefits have been documented by decades of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40 years ago, a pioneering study showed that hospitalized patients needed fewer painkillers and recovered quicker when they looked out of a window onto green space rather than a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet until now, the underlying reasons for this effect were unclear," said Maximilian Steininger, a neuroscientist at the University of Vienna and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56870-2"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that both nature and pain can be subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people like nature, it could have a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect. Or what if it is not nature that reduces pain, but city life that increases it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155158" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-642x685.jpg" alt="Neurologic pain signature" class="size-medium wp-image-155158" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-642x685.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-389x415.jpg 389w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-600x640.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155158" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain response shows overall brain activity involved in processing the location and intensity of pain. This response was lower when people were exposed to virtual nature scenes compared to urban or indoor scenes. (Max Steininger/University of Vienna)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more, the researchers recorded the brain activity of 49 volunteers using functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fRMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects looked at different images while receiving a series of electric shocks – some more painful than others – on the back of their left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first scene depicted a lake surrounded by trees blowing in the wind, while the sounds of rustling leaves and birdsong played in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second scene, some urban elements such as buildings, benches and alleyways were added, while city noise intruded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third scene was of an office, with the accompanying drab furniture and whir of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Important practical implications'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the participants report feeling less pain when they looking at the natural landscapes, the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; showed there was a difference in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study is the first to provide evidence from brain scans that this isn't just a placebo effect," Steininger said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076537"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature scenes provoked decreased activity in a part of the brain involved in perceiving pain, called nociception. However other areas linked to regulating pain were not significantly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the results could be because natural environments capture people's attention, diverting them away from the sensation of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known in psychology as the "attention restoration theory".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that this pain-relieving effect can be achieved through a virtual nature exposure which is easy to administer has important practical implications," said study co-author Alex Smalley from the UK's Exeter University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also "opens new avenues for research to better understand how nature impacts our minds," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, Calif. (VVNG.com) –&lt;/strong&gt; The San Bernardino County Public Health Department has confirmed four pediatric influenza-related deaths for the 2024-2025 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the deceased children, two did not have any known medical conditions, while the other two had significant underlying health issues. Notably, all four children were unvaccinated against influenza this season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We extend our sincerest condolences to the families of these children. These fatalities are a reminder that influenza can be a serious and often deadly disease among our most vulnerable populations,” said San Bernardino County Health Officer Dr. Sharon Wang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flu season typically spans from November 1 to April 30 each year, with flu-related emergency room visits usually peaking between December and February. This season has seen a concerning 64.6 percent increase in hospitalizations compared to the previous year, the county confirmed in a &lt;a href="https://main.sbcounty.gov/2025/03/13/county-confirms-flu-related-pediatric-deaths/"&gt;written statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To protect yourself and your loved ones, it’s essential to understand flu symptoms, recognize when to seek medical care, and adopt preventive measures,” the county stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone six months of age and older. Other preventive measures include frequent handwashing, wearing masks in crowded or high-risk environments, avoiding close contact with those who are sick, and regularly disinfecting commonly touched surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;				
				



&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women, children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are particularly at risk for severe flu complications, and are urged by the county to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flu symptoms typically include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and fatigue. Children may also experience vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have trouble breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion or bluish lips or face, seek medical care immediately,” the statement read. “If you are at higher risk and develop flu symptoms, contact your healthcare provider right away. Early antiviral treatment can help reduce severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information on influenza, please visit the California Department of Public Health’s Influenza page. For further inquiries, the county’s Public Health Communicable Disease Section can be reached at 1-800-722-4794 or by email at &lt;a&gt;CDS@dph.sbcounty.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I would still attend social gatherings, but I wasn't as confident as I usually am.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After tolerating her symptoms for a few months, she decided to visit her primary care doctor and was told to get blood tests to rule out &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-84d6f150-00f2-11f0-9713-057e655d193b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or other serious health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, they were negative, but that left Adesso still scrambling for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Briana Adesso, 31, an elementary special education teacher pictured here before her hypothyroidism diagnosis in August 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She had gained about 40 pounds in the span of six months between late 2022 to early 2023. Pictured here in April 2023, a month before her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctor then took an&lt;span&gt; ultrasound of her thyroid - a butterfly-shaped gland that &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12744113/Bizarre-symptom-thyroid-cancer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;produces hormones that regulate metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, growth, and development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It revealed multiple benign growths on the gland itself which were interfering with hormone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism - or an underactive thyroid - which had caused her metabolism to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolism is the body's ability to convert food and drink into energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a slow metabolism means the body burns fewer calories at rest, making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is also known to impact appetite and people may experience food cravings and increased calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause muscle weakness, thinning hair, dry skin, impaired memory function, low moods and changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five percent of people in the US aged 12 and older experience some degree of hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Eve Bloomgarden, an endocrinologist at Northwestern Medicine explained: 'Hypothyroidism from any cause results in a decrease in energy metabolism, or the basal metabolic rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients often experience a modest amount of weight gain prior to diagnosis because of this metabolic slowing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kimberly Bethel from the Trotwood Physician Center in Ohio further added: 'The thyroid’s function is to regulate the metabolism of the body - how fast or slow things go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It affects everything from the top of the head all the way down to the toes. And we know it affects a person’s weight. If you are a fast metabolizer you will burn more calories, or if you are a slow metabolizer, you’re going to gain weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypothyroidism can be caused by a multitude of reasons, including an iodine deficiency, pituitary gland disorders such as non-cancerous tumors and thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid that can happen after a viral illness or pregnancy). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to thyroid issues, Ms Adesso was also found to be suffering from insulin resistance - a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, which can cause weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis in 2023, she was prescribed Synthroid - a drug regularly used to treat hypothyroidism - and semaglutide - the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Adesso said she has managed to 50 pounds as of this month. She is pictured here in March 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also maintained her healthy lifestyle by continuing to work out and eat healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of treatments was working, but her insurance stopped paying for the semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While her insurance initially covered it, she eventually was forced to pay out of pocket - with a monthly supply of semaglutide typically costing $1,350. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'My endocrinologist prescribed me Synthroid and Semaglutide. On top of the medications, I maintain a healthy, well balanced diet and continue to be very active.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since starting her regimen, Ms Adesso told this website she has managed to lose 50lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I am extremely thankful for Semaglutide. There is such a stigma around taking this medicine but it truly helped me so much.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having both hypothyroidism and insulin resistance made it nearly impossible for me to lose weight, no matter how many diets I went on or the amount of exercise I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately my insurance stopped covering this medication and I was paying out of pocket for many months, but it truly was such a key factor in my success of losing weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNTGpyTUZaSFdyMVAxR3ZfZTIzc1k0c1FXOHRWcHBNUW5SVXdBNTdYS2hkMzNqbWxIVkJHa0dRUm9WRDY0UWljbFJuQlc3OUhuTEZLemREVVlSdmpTUG9FeUF6OHIwVnJwQmhGdTJnSXd2WWVLMkdyTzVhYkpxYmJTS3l6cFZGblZ3dlhTLWNTSVhUbXhxS1EwbmdYd2QtaVZ3aEJMODUxVdIBrAFBVV95cUxNLVlzZDYtcHBXeUFhNGdER2M2T25wQ3ZJZmNzRVdwa004RDVNZ01mQ2lNWnBvcm5ndWxzTERial9lTEgtd3VVdnkxajBkeV9sSG90bElTMkFwV1Vqa0JETTVKeTVQR2pfWFRSSFdmdVVSRjlKb1N5amMxQWU4RGhqQUVna29IMkpIelJqV0Y4ZVprNnk1YXBmaDMwQUJUdWtoeVhxOXlUWkgyVGhU</guid></item><item><title>Doctors Are Changing Their Advice About Blood Sugar for Older People - InsideHook</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE03aTl5S25oTFFMTEVuVy1pVk1HUE5WdVVWY09RVEFKMnFON0JaTHlaQjhWMTdYYWZRSXgxcnFyWjJRT2ZGOU05WEZGMlpwUWJrMjJ2dl9obFcyR3NQbkZOZXlSZGdzMVdmUm9GQjZyaEdPYUR4X0pTVNIBfkFVX3lxTE1uY29adkRRbDlFZFBXOXY3OE9WQzlxTE5lOWpQcjlpY0lPc2gwQjE0TFhjTVMzN3IxMV83R0tKWndLRTliVHEzTWxjdl9MMWZ3bHlPWDlvUWNydElKMHpQR19VRDg0NkE5OV9ZU1VNNmVvVVVnNkFVeE5QbElPdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;
							
&lt;p&gt;As we age, is it more important to keep one’s blood sugar levels from getting too high or too low? In a perfect world, the answer would be “both” — but a growing number of doctors are now leaning towards a higher tolerance for higher blood sugar as we grow older.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Mayo Clinic and other experts &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685"&gt;have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, hypoglycemia — when someone’s levels of blood sugar go below the standard range — is a condition that needs to be treated as quickly as possible. In a recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/diabetes-blood-sugar-age.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, Paula Span explained why doctors working with older Americans are starting to emphasize preventing blood sugar levels from getting too low, even if that means that those same levels could go too high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sei Lee of the University of California, San Francisco told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that maintaining precise control of one’s blood sugar isn’t as important as one ages. “It was really important when you were 50. Now, it’s less important,” Dr. Lee said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Span points out that medical guidelines on what blood sugar levels are considered “too high” have evolved over the years, with organizations like the American Geriatrics Society and the American Diabetes Association advocating for higher hemoglobin a1c levels for older Americans living with diabetes and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt; 



	




&lt;p&gt;Experts have also observed that trying to control blood sugar too much as patients age can have negative effects on its own. Another expert cited in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, Dr. Joseph G. Ouslander, criticized what he referred to as “the astoundingly high rates of overtreatment of diabetes in older people in general” in &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.19201"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; published last year in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with managing any chronic condition, finding the right balance here is optimal. But what that right balance might be is very different for someone who’s 40 and someone who’s 80. &lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14461221/Im-pharmacist-three-vitamins-tell-avoid.html"&gt;there can be too much&lt;/a&gt; of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While vitamins are touted as good for you, the body isn't designed to handle excessive vitamin intake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Humans have evolved to require only small amounts, naturally found in a wide variety of foods, to support cell and organ function, and the body isn't able to quickly eliminate excess vitamins, allowing some to build to dangerous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplement overdoses can lead to serious complications, including liver and kidney damage, hardening of soft tissues, bleeding, and nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because it can take weeks or even months for signs of toxicity from some vitamins to cause symptoms, you may be causing damage without even realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of overdose depends on the base recommendation. For instance, the recommended amount of vitamin A for adult men is 900 micrograms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking too much - about three to four times the recommendation - can lead to minor symptoms like a headache or severe complications like brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iron is essential for producing hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells, but taking over 20mg can be toxic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Iron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 8 milligrams (mg) for men; 18 mg for women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron plays a key role in the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, but too much, around 20mg or higher, can be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of iron toxicity may start out minor and be blamed on something common like the stomach flu and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, severe iron poisoning can lead to severe complications like liver damage and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harm becomes even more severe when a person takes too much over a long period of time. Gradually, iron accumulates in the organs, causing potentially fatal damage to the brain and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron supplement overdose over an extended period of time mimics a natural iron balance disorder called iron overload. This is caused by the body’s regulatory system failing to keep iron levels within healthy limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, an excess of iron can increase one’s risk of arthritis, colon cancer, liver problems, diabetes, and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Calcium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults 51 and up: 1,000 to 1,200 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate calcium is crucial to shoring up the bones and keeping skeletal muscles working properly. Calcium supplements are often recommended to seniors who are at increased risk of deficiency and osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brittle bones make severe breaks and fractures more likely, especially in the hips, spine, risk, and forearm. They’re likely to be painful and require surgery to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's important to strike the right balance. Taking more than 1,200 mg can lead to hypercalcemia, in which too much calcium is circulating in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause a wide range of symptoms from seemingly innocuous nausea and constipation, to more concerning effects like dehydration, confusion and disorientation, muscle and bone pain, high blood pressure, kidney damage, and even coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Severe cases of vitamin D overdose can lead to kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythm, as well as an unsteady gait, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea, bone pain, and muscle weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 600 International Units (IU)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is often thoughts of as the sunshine vitamin as people can get it from about 15 minutes of being in the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who prefer the shade, however, doctors recommend 600 international units (IU). Taking extremely high doses – around 4,000 IU – over a long period of time can cause vitamin D toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe cases can lead to kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythm, as well as an unsteady gait, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea, bone pain, and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of vitamin D toxicity are rare, with roughly 4,500 cases in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sunlight is an excellent source of vitamin D, spending too much time outdoors will not cause vitamin D toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D toxicity doesn't occur suddenly and you may be experiencing it without even realizing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it occurs when a person takes large doses of supplements over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 900 microgram retinol activity equivalents (mg RAE) for men, 700 mcg RAE for women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immunity and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But exceeding 3,000 mcg RAE of vitamin A can, over time, cause significant organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A toxicity leads to hypervitaminosis A. Taking a lot over a short amount of time has been known to cause nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, loss of appetite, and headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic over-use causes the liver to malfunction and become enlarged until it fails. High vitamin A levels may also cause weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who take too much vitamin A also risk birth defects in their babies, such as a cleft palate or cleft lip, congenital heart defects, brain malformations, and thyroid problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women are generally advised not to exceed 770 mcg RAE per day, which can come from cod liver oil, egg yolks, whole milk, cheese, and beef liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Too much magnesium can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, irregular heart rhythm, kidney damage, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It has also been shown to help reduce stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much magnesium, though, can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, irregular heart rhythm, kidney damage, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases or if the kidneys aren’t working well, dialysis might be needed to remove the excess magnesium from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypermagnesemia is rare because the kidneys remove excess magnesium. But complications can occur in people with kidney problems who take magnesium-containing medications like laxatives or antacids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with kidney disease, heart disease, or digestive issues are at higher risk and should avoid magnesium supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Folic acid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 400 mcg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for pregnant women: at least 600 mcg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Folic acid helps prevent birth defects in a baby’s brain and spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid is commonly taken by pregnant women or women trying to conceive as it helps prevent birth defects in a baby’s brain and spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mineral plays a crucial role in producing red blood cells in utero and supports the development of the baby’s neural tube into their brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid also works alongside other vitamins such as B12 to control high levels of an amino acid called homocysteine, which has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In high amounts, however, folic acid can obscure a deficiency of B12, which can lead to severe nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When taken in large quantities, folic acid can correct low red blood cell counts, but it does not address potential nerve damage that has gone undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much folic acid can also irritate the digestive system, causing bloating, gas, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Institutes of Health officials have urged scientists to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, two researchers said, in a move that signaled the agency might abandon a promising field of medical research.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology is under study at the NIH for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including flu and AIDS, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine/"&gt;also cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It was deployed in the development of covid-19 vaccines credited with &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives"&gt;saving 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. alone — an accomplishment &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/"&gt;President Donald Trump bragged about&lt;/a&gt; in his first term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scientist at a biomedical research center in Philadelphia wrote to a colleague, in an email reviewed by KFF Health News, that a project officer at NIH had “flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s still unclear whether mRNA vaccine grants will be canceled,” the scientist added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIH officials also told a senior NIH-funded vaccine scientist in New York state, who does not conduct mRNA vaccine research but described its efficacy in previous grant applications, that all references to mRNA vaccines should be scrubbed from future applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists relayed their experiences on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A senior official at the National Cancer Institute confirmed that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memoli sent a similar message ahead of the agency canceling other research, such as studies of vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memoli’s email on that topic bluntly stated that NIH was not interested in learning why people shun vaccines or in exploring ways to “improve vaccine interest and commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Cancer Institute official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that “it is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The official said a similar memo also went out regarding NIH-funded work in South Africa, which the White House has targeted over false claims that the country’s government is persecuting white people. More recently, another one went out regarding all global research collaborations, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the White House, HHS, and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH, whose latest annual budget was $47 billion, is one of the world’s most critical sources of funding for basic biomedical research. Its mission and programs are under unprecedented scrutiny from Trump’s White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led agency&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;created by a Trump executive order that has directed federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH is funding at least 130 studies involving the mRNA technology in covid vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that have been administered to billions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A former government official familiar with internal discussions said that the Trump administration intends to cut some grants for mRNA vaccine research but that the timing is unclear. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political conservatives in the U.S. have promulgated conspiracy theories, unsupported by scientific evidence, that the shots and their relatively new technology are dangerous. This has undermined public support for covid vaccinations and mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines,” the scientist in New York said in an interview. “MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, hundreds of other vaccine-related studies are in limbo. Kawsar Talaat, a vaccine researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has been waiting since the fall for money needed to recruit subjects for a study of an antidiarrheal vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NIH approved our funding,” she said, “and now we’re waiting, and we don’t know if it’s going forward or going to be killed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientist in Philadelphia signaled that he believes Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is responsible for the NIH’s turn against mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started,” the scientist told his colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientist in New York said that it was “ridiculous” to remove mRNA language from the grant applications. But “if my grant is rejected for any reason,” the scientist said, “people in my lab will lose their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked with some of them for 20 years,” the scientist added. “They have children and families. There is a real climate of fear in academia about this now, especially among vaccine scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My grant does not involve a request for funds to conduct mRNA vaccine experiments,” the scientist said, “so my principal concern was to avoid word-search flags that, at minimum, would lead to delays in any funding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While tenured research professors at universities generally receive a salary from their institution, the staffers who work in their labs and offices are often paid through NIH grants. The &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/"&gt;2023 Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in physiology or medicine was given to two scientists for developing mRNA vaccines, through work that relied on pharmaceutical companies and on NIH scientists working under infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;According to Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the chamber’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kennedy promised during his Senate confirmation process that he would protect “the public health benefit of vaccination” and “work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a physician, had expressed reservations about confirming Kennedy to the HHS post and challenged his anti-vaccine views during a confirmation hearing. He ended up voting for him, he said, because &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;Kennedy had agreed&lt;/a&gt; to work closely with Cassidy and his committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy has faced scrutiny in his first weeks in office for his handling of a large measles outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people in Texas that has led to the death of a child, the first U.S. measles death in more than a decade. A patient who tested positive for measles died in New Mexico, but the cause hasn’t been confirmed. Instead of urging vaccination against the disease, an almost surefire way to prevent infection, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/measles-more-likely-severe-among-malnourished-rfk-says"&gt;blamed malnourishment for the outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, promoted unproven treatments for measles, and falsely claimed &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;in one Fox News interview&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine is ineffective and even dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy did not respond to a request for comment on the NIH’s potential abandonment of mRNA vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the Trump administration’s push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines, health officials are reviewing a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-26/trump-administration-orders-bird-flu-shot-review-as-risks-rise&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1742157241275120&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1ljj05wrVfb8mqwVwTd4ML"&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-26/trump-administration-orders-bird-flu-shot-review-as-risks-rise"&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt;. Legislation introduced by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states is aimed at &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/"&gt;banning or limiting mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and the possible revocation of their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — One young girl is about to spend her third consecutive birthday at Primary Children's Hospital. Sienna, 4, was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and needs an artificial heart and a medical team to keep her alive until a heart transplant is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sienna is the youngest of three children in her family and she has been in the hospital since early 2023. Her mom said they live 45 minutes away from the hospital — when traffic is good. Family comes to stay with the girl every day — either Sienna's mom, dad or grandparents. Sienna's mom said her upcoming birthday is a difficult milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You hope that you know, that's not their life story," Francesca Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of her long stay, a new cardiac rehabilitation program introduced at Primary Children's Hospital is significantly improving her life right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bringing the pizzazz&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Pavlock, an exercise physiologist and cardiac rehab lead, said she met Sienna about six months after the long hospital stay began. The girl was sitting, watching TV and not moving much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Active play wasn't really part of Sienna's day," Pavlock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, she said, the girl started walking to the end of the hallway, pushing weights and picking things up off the floor. Now, Sienna looks forward to exercises and always wants to go for a run and sing — Pavlock said the nurses have to work to keep up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She doesn't even realize she's working out at this point," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sienna Barton, 4, pushes a doll in a stroller at Primary Children's Hospital. She is one of the first heart patients to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Intermountain Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They bring along a speaker to play music and make it fun — individualizing treatment to each patients' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We definitely bring the pizzazz," Pavlock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you walk past Sienna's room she is having a dance party and singing. Pavlock said she is now active for the majority of each day, as a healthy child would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Ziebell, a pediatric cardiologist and director of the cardiac rehab program, said cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program to build physical strength in heart patients. For patients like Sienna, he said it is helping prepare her and build strength to help her recover from her eventual heart transplant. Ziebell said the exercise, three times a week, is keeping her from becoming weak due to the hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our program is very intentional about getting her very active, and as active as she can," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A unique program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziebell said the program helps outpatient children learn their limits and can lead to them participating in physical education classes or sports, even amid their various ailments. The program consists of 36 sessions in three months and then patients graduate with the confidence and training to exercise on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This program is unique because it is geared toward children, he said, adding that cardiac rehabilitation is mainstream for adult heart patients. Primary Children's is, however, one of the first facilities to adapt the program for young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziebell said about 15 patients are currently involved in the program, in addition to others who have graduated over the last few years. The program is available at both Primary Children's locations in Utah and as a telemedicine program for children who can't easily travel to Utah or Salt Lake counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regularly assisted exercise teaches kids how to exercise independently, and hospital data and parent feedback show the program is making a difference, Ziebell said. It lays a foundation for other comprehensive heart programs to grow, and eventually, this process will be the standard of care like it is for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to be kids, despite having a heart condition," he said. "If we're going to promote lifelong health we need to get these kids active very young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A health care provider checks Sienna Barton's heart at Primary Children's Hospital. She is one of the first heart patients to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Intermountain Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pavlock said taking Sienna into the hall requires a "whole squad." They need two nurses to carry the ventricular assistance device, or artificial heart, and her medications in an IV bag. Sienna was one of the first two patients to participate in the program, and they both started on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It not only helps improve their physical health, but their mental health as well because they feel so strong after completing the program that they go out and they're able to do it. They're not scared to exercise anymore. … They're living their lives," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ready for a transplant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton wants her family to live together again, but that won't happen until her daughter gets a heart transplant — eliminating the need for an artificial heart — and goes through a recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Sienna is happy at the hospital but isn't able to interact with many other kids because of the need to keep all of the children there healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get her involved in exercise the team uses Taylor Swift, hanging a Bluetooth speaker on the IV pole, and takes her outside to throw rocks in the pond. Barton said they try to help her discover the outdoors, which is limited for Sienna because of the need for staff to help her move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One time we found a ladybug, and for months after, they would take her out there to the grassy area, and they would build a house for the ladybug," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton said the therapy has strengthened her body and kept her from being sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strength is already there and the fight is already in there, the bite is in there — she's ready. The spiciness is there, and all you need is that new heart and the rest of the body will teach it how to go, teach it how to keep up," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Barton family poses for a photo. Sienna Barton, 4, is one of the first heart patients at Primary Children's Hospital to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Michelle Paul)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Sienna's blood type, and how far Salt Lake City is from most of the large population centers she is one of only a few children in the U.S. who has waited for a heart for this long at the highest status of need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton encouraged people who hear her daughter's story to talk about organ donation with their families now. She said making a decision now means one less decision for a family going through a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advocated for signing up to be an organ donor in college because of a friend with a heart condition, and now she will always be an advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It truly is such an incredible way to remember your little one and remember your loved ones and allow them to live on," Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;
