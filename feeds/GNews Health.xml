              &lt;p&gt;The grim reaper can sometimes take decades to catch up with its victims. In a report out this week, scientists describe a woman who died from an incurable prion disease caught roughly 50 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors detailed the unusual case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 58-year-old woman developed a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) likely contracted through contaminated human growth hormone (HGH) treatments she received as a child, they determined. The tragic death may represent the longest latency period ever documented for this universally fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disease-causing prions are one of the strangest things that can sicken people. They’re the misfolded form of the normal (but still very mysterious) prion protein found in our bodies and brains. When a rogue prion comes across its harmless counterpart, it converts the latter into a misfolded copy of itself, much like a zombie outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, the exponential accumulation of bad prions destroys the brain, leading to symptoms like dementia and death soon after. If that’s not scary enough, prions are naturally resistant to most standard methods of sterilization used to kill off other infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The one saving grace is that prion diseases in general remain very rare, though other prion-like diseases like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alzheimers-disease-transmissable-human-growth-hormone-1851206087"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prions can emerge sporadically for no clear reason, can be caused by inherited mutations, or they can be transmitted though close contact with infected bodily fluids or brain matter. In the 1980s, for instance, doctors discovered that people could catch CJD through human growth hormone extracted from prion-infected cadavers. A decade later, we learned that people could also catch CJD via tainted beef from cows infected with their own version of prion disease (nicknamed mad cow disease).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery of HGH-related CJD quickly led to the end of cadaver-sourced HGH in the U.S. and other countries (thankfully, synthetic HGH became available soon after). Still, over two hundred cases of iatrogenic CJD—iatrogenic meaning it was caused by a medical treatment—from tainted HGH have been documented worldwide. Most of these cases were reported between five and 10 years after people had used HGH. But prion disease can sometimes take much longer to manifest in certain people, even decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to this latest report, the woman first visited doctors with tremors and trouble balancing. As is often the case, once symptoms started, her condition rapidly worsened. She was hospitalized just four weeks later, and several days into her stay, she fell into a coma that she would never awaken from.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An autopsy confirmed the woman’s death from CJD but ruled out known genetic causes. And since she received HGH treatment prior to the cadaver ban, it was likely the root source of her illness, the doctors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HGH is used to treat severe growth-related conditions in children, and is typically taken over many years, including in this case. That makes it impossible to know exactly when the woman contracted CJD. Her first treatment was 51.3 years prior to her symptoms appearing, for instance, while her last treatment was 42.1 years earlier. But the U.S. switched to a different method of collecting HGH from cadavers in 1977, one that inadvertently and greatly reduced the risk of prion contamination. Based on that, the most likely timeframe for her infection is around 48.3 years earlier, the authors calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are known cases of people dying from CJD infections caught over &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prion-disease-can-lurk-in-your-brain-for-30-years-befor-1823628617"&gt;30 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(06)68930-7/abstract"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of other prion diseases emerging over a half century later. But this appears to be the longest case of HGH-related CJD documented so far, though it might not be the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that genetics can influence a person’s chances of developing prion disease. And the woman possessed a mutation in the gene that codes for the prion protein linked to longer latency periods. So while tainted human growth hormone hasn’t caused CJD for a very long time, some people out there may still one day succumb to their earlier exposure (it’s estimated that around 7,700 people in the U.S. took HGH prior to the cadaver ban).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors say that doctors treating neurological illness should at least be on the lookout for these delayed cases, especially if their patients have a history of HGH treatment before 1977.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although the US iCJD outbreak has slowed substantially, the potential for new cases remains,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the boy's fourth month, researchers were meeting with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss regulatory approval for a clinical trial—a trial where KJ would be the only participant. They were also working with the institutional review board (IRB) at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to go over the clinical protocol, safety, and ethical aspects of the treatment. The researchers described the unprecedented speed of the oversight steps as being "through alternative procedures."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In month five, they started toxicology testing in mice. In the mice, the experimental therapy corrected KJ's mutation, replacing the errant A-T base pair with the correct G-C pair in the animals' cells. The first dose provided a 42 percent whole-liver corrective rate in the animals. At the start of KJ's sixth month, the researchers had results from safety testing in monkeys: Their customized base-editing therapy, delivered as mRNA via a lipid nanoparticle, did not produce any toxic effects in the monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical-grade batch of the treatment was readied. In month seven, further testing of the treatment found acceptably low-levels of off-target genetic changes. The researchers submitted the FDA paperwork for approval of an "investigational new drug," or IND, for KJ. The FDA approved it in a week. The researchers then started KJ on an immune-suppressing treatment to make sure his immune system wouldn't react to the gene-editing therapy. Then, when KJ was still just 6 months old, he got a first low dose of his custom gene-editing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Transformational”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the treatment, he was able to start eating more protein, which would have otherwise caused his ammonia levels to skyrocket. But he couldn’t be weaned off of the drug treatment used to keep his ammonia levels down (nitrogen scavenging medication). With no safety concerns seen after the first dose, KJ has since gotten two more doses of the gene therapy and is now on reduced nitrogen scavenging medication. With more protein in his diet, he has moved from the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile in weight to 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile. He's now about 9 and a half months old, and his doctors are preparing to allow him to go home from the hospital for the first time. Though he will have to be closely monitored and may still at some point need a liver transplant, his family and doctors are celebrating the improvements so far.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

Fight me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his fiery post, the sci-fi star declared that the scientists in charge of astronomical research were 'just a bunch of corrupt nerds on a power trip' and said it was time for Trump to end their 'tyranny of the cosmos.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shatner spent Thursday night sparring with fans on X and suggested that Trump should step in make Pluto a planet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He even called on Musk, the so-called 'first buddy,' to convince Trump to sign an executive order giving Pluto back its status in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a surprising turn for the actor, who recently criticized Trump for his continued attempts to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14685859/William-Shatner-Trump-Canada.html"&gt;purchase his home country&lt;/a&gt; of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent interview with Bill Maher, the Shatner was baffled by the results of the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't know why Democrats lost.

Former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, Elon Musk, and William Shatner have all supported the cause of giving Pluto its planetary status back &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tyson, an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, has been a strong supporter of demoting Pluto from its status as a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pluto is not only different from the other planets, it's part of a whole new family of objects,' he argued in his book The Pluto Files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Shatner has some major support in this controversy, including the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-7653569/NASA-chief-Jim-Bridenstine-says-Pluto-planet-AGAIN.html"&gt;former head of NASA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, Jim Bridenstine refused to accept the change, claiming that Pluto was still the ninth planet because it has an ocean under its surface, organic compounds on its surface, and its own moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can write that the NASA Administrator declared Pluto a planet once again. I'm sticking by that, it's the way I learnt it, and I'm committed to it,' Bridenstine said at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bridenstine led the space agency from 2018 to 2021 after being appointed to the position during President Trump's first term in office. He's criticized the IAU for having a 'sloppy definition' of what they consider a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
       

  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing the first in vitro diagnostic device that tests blood to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is for the early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease in adult patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease impacts too many people, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,” &lt;strong&gt;said FDA Commissioner Martin A. Makary, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt; “Knowing that 10% of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder known to slowly destroy memory and thinking skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks, is progressive, meaning that the disease gets worse over time. In most people with Alzheimer’s disease, clinical symptoms first appear later in life. Amyloid plaques in a patient’s brain are a hallmark sign of Alzheimer’s disease. While amyloid plaques can occur in other diseases, being able to detect the presence of plaque, along with other evaluations, helps the doctor determine the probable cause of the patient’s symptoms and findings. These plaques can be detected and visualized using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, often years before clinical symptom onset, to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. PET scans, however, are a costly and time-consuming option and expose patients to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1-42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. Similar FDA-authorized/cleared tests, one from the same company as this new test, are used with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, which are collected through an invasive lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. This new Lumipulse test only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million,” &lt;strong&gt;said Center for Devices and Radiological Health Director Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt; “Today’s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During review of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio, the FDA evaluated data from a multi-center clinical study of 499 individual plasma samples from adults who were cognitively impaired. The samples were tested by the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio and compared with amyloid PET scan or CSF test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this clinical study, 91.7% of individuals with Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio positive results had the presence of amyloid plaques by PET scan or CSF test result, and 97.3 % of individuals with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or CSF test result. Less than 20% of the 499 patients tested received an indeterminate Lumipulse G pTau217/β-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired. The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks associated with the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio are mainly the possibility of false positive and false negative test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False positive results, in conjunction with other clinical information, could lead to an inappropriate diagnosis of, and unnecessary treatment for, Alzheimer’s disease. This could lead to psychological distress, delay in receiving a correct diagnosis as well as expense and the risk for side effects from unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False negative results could result in additional unnecessary diagnostic tests and potential delay in effective treatment. Importantly, the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic test and other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA reviewed the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio through the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-approvals-and-clearances/510k-clearances"&gt;510(k) premarket notification pathway&lt;/a&gt;. A 510(k) notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA found that the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is substantially equivalent to the Lumipulse G β-amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40), which is the previously authorized test that uses CSF samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio was granted &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/breakthrough-devices-program"&gt;Breakthrough Device&lt;/a&gt; designation, a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA issued clearance of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio to Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

They are harmful for environment and lead to plastic pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13439229/microplastics-men-testicles-sperm-quality.html"&gt;These tiny particles can accumulate in the body&lt;/a&gt;, with prior research linking them to various forms of cancer—including skin, breast, cervical, and colorectal—as well as testicular &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-831b2030-3279-11f0-8b15-c57a9c269533"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that individuals diagnosed with dementia exhibited up to ten times more microplastics in their brain tissue compared to those without this condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the study does not directly connect them, it does show a relationship between the accumulation of microplastics and neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Professor Matthew Campen of the University of New Mexico emphasized the urgency of understanding how these particles penetrate the brain’s protective barriers—and what damage they may cause over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never would have imagined it was this high,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed brain tissue from 28 autopsies in 2016 and 26 in 2024, discovering that every sample contained microplastics, equivalent in mass to an entire plastic spoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Campen, a toxicologist, said microplastic levels in the human brain have increased by 50 percent over the past eight years, mirroring the global rise in plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate this trend, Campen's team analyzed brain tissue samples provided by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, which is legally required to retain autopsy tissue for seven years before disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The samples were taken during autopsies in 2016 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All samples were taken from the frontal cortex—the brain region located above and behind the eyes, Campen noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To isolate microplastics, the tissues were dissolved using a specialized chemical process that left behind a pellet of undissolved material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pellet was then heated, allowing researchers to capture the gas emissions released as the plastics burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using this technique, the team detected and measured 12 different plastic polymers. The most common was polyethylene, a material widely used in packaging and containers such as bottles and cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, the brain tissue contained about 4,800 micrograms of microplastic per gram —roughly equivalent to the weight of a plastic spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered clusters of sharp plastic shards measuring 200 nanometers or smaller—not much larger than some viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than 5mm in size and insoluble in water. They are harmful for environment and lead to plastic pollution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics—especially nanoplastics—can cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective shield that typically prevents harmful substances from entering the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once inside, these tiny particles may trigger inflammation, disrupt neurological signaling, and potentially contribute to the development of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are still investigating the direct impact of microplastics on human health, animal studies have shown that exposure can lead to behavioral changes, memory impairment, and reduced motor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gary Small, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center, emphasized that current findings in relation to dementia do not prove a causal relationship, but they are still cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common plastics identified in brain samples were polyethylene and polypropylene, materials widely used in packaging, containers, and everyday consumer goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These particles most likely enter the body through contaminated food and beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Professor Campen, the research team even found significant levels of microplastics in store-bought meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To that he added, 'The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, chemicals may accumulate in fields as a result of the feeding of crops to livestock and the fertilization of fields with their waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study conducted by the Ocean Conservancy found that highly processed protein products—such as fish sticks, chicken nuggets, and plant-based burgers—contained significantly more microplastics per gram than minimally processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, health professionals recommend several strategies to reduce microplastic exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include using glass or stainless steel containers instead of single-use plastics, installing water purifiers, and choosing natural fibers over synthetic fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study's findings have sparked growing calls for urgent action to limit microplastic exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advocates are also pushing for stricter regulations on plastic production and waste management to curb environmental pollution at its source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The detection of microplastics in every human brain sample analyzed underscores the widespread reach of plastic pollution—and its potential implications for human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As scientists continue to investigate the long-term effects of microplastic exposure, experts stress the importance of taking preventive steps now to reduce risk and safeguard public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found the poorest results were seen in people who showed depressive symptoms, and had nine or more hours sleep a night, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mood disorder is known to trigger patterns of excessive sleep, and the experts pose that depression, rather than sleep itself, may be driving the cognitive decline in these patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, its not just those who suffer from low mood that are at risk from too much rest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who showed no signs of depression, but slept for more than nine hours a night, experienced decreased cognitive function, struggling with global cognition and visual reproduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Disturbances in sleep duration and patterns contribute to an increased risk of cognitive deficits and Alzheimer's disease', Prof Young explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings echo that of previous studies, including one 10-year-long report, published in the Psychiatry Research journal, that found sleeping for more than eight hours a night, on average, was linked with an alarming 64 per cent increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst experts are not entirely sure why excess shut eye could contribute to dementia, one Swedish &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453#bib0065"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;suggested the explanation may lie with the impact on our circadian rhythms—the natural sleep-wake cycles that determine a host of bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm argued that being asleep during the daytime could impact the brain's ability to clear waste that builds up during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the scientists&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453#bib0043"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;said it is also possible that brain damage caused by early dementia could be fueling a need for excess sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as a landmark study last year suggested almost half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—could be prevented by tackling 14 lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included hearing loss, high cholesterol, vision loss and lack of exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claimed the study, published in the prestigious journal The Lancet, provided more hope than 'ever before' that the disorder that blights the lives of millions can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease affects 982,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2019 estimate put the annual death toll at 70,000 people a year with the health issues caused costing the NHS £700million each year to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around 2million per year, making it in the running to be among the top 10 leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="72" data-end="601"&gt;A new long-term study is challenging decades of diet discourse around carbohydrates—this time, not with warnings of weight gain or blood sugar spikes, but with data connecting high-quality carb consumption to healthy aging. Published in &lt;em data-start="316" data-end="335"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834202?guestAccessKey=d876a1c9-c298-43d8-8354-2befe857fad9&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=051625" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; tracked more than 47,000 women over three decades, revealing that those who consumed &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/plant-based-foods-most-fiber" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;more dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; and carbohydrates from whole plant foods in midlife had a significantly higher chance of aging healthfully into their 70s, 80s, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="72" data-end="601"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="related-article-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/sucralose-mind-diet-brain-health-studies"&gt;Sucralose Scrambles Brain Signals While the MIND Diet Restores Them, Studies Find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="603" data-end="1131"&gt;Researchers from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from the renowned Nurses’ Health Study, which began in 1976 and remains one of the largest and longest-running studies on women’s health. Using food-frequency questionnaires gathered every four years from 1984 through 2016, the researchers focused on dietary intake in midlife—specifically carbohydrates—and cross-referenced that with health outcomes in later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="603" data-end="1131"&gt;Quality carbs equal longer life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1133" data-end="1589"&gt;“We’ve all heard that different carbohydrates can affect health differently, whether for weight, energy, or blood sugar levels. But rather than just look at the immediate effects of these macronutrients, we wanted to understand what they might mean for good health 30 years later,” Andres Ardisson Korat, scientist at the HNRCA and lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Our findings suggest that carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="credit" data-start="1133" data-end="1589"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjUwMjEyLzMuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMzYweCIseyJmb3JtYXQiOm51bGx9XSxbInAiLCJvcHRpbWl6ZSJdXQ/3.jpg?sha=81eb8a9566a18f58" alt="older woman grocery shopping"&gt;Canva&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1591" data-end="2086"&gt;Healthy aging, as defined by the study, included living without major chronic illness, retaining strong cognitive and physical function, and maintaining good mental health. Of the participants analyzed—who were between the ages of 70 and 93 in 2016—just 3,706 met this definition. But among those who consumed more unrefined carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, as well as more dietary fiber overall, the odds of reaching older age in good health rose substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2088" data-end="2438"&gt;Specifically, the researchers found that high midlife intakes of dietary fiber and high-quality carbohydrates were linked to a six to 37 percent greater likelihood of &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/food-lessons-oldest-people-blue-zones" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in refined carbohydrates and starchy vegetables—such as white potatoes—were associated with 13 percent lower odds of aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="2440" data-end="2794"&gt;“Our results are consistent with other evidence linking consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes with lower risks of chronic diseases, and now we see the association with physical and cognitive function outcomes,” said Qi Sun, associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2440" data-end="2794"&gt;Fiber and healthier aging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2796" data-end="3410"&gt;The implications are particularly meaningful in the context of rising life expectancy and increased interest in how to extend not just lifespan, but healthspan—the number of years lived in good health. According to data from the World Health Organization, global average life expectancy has increased by more than six years since 2000, reaching 73.4 years in 2019. But the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy remains significant. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that while life expectancy is around 77 years, only about 68 of those are spent in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3412" data-end="3553"&gt;Against that backdrop, this new study strengthens the case for fiber-rich, plant-based diets in supporting both longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3555" data-end="3902"&gt;The research builds on a growing body of evidence that prioritizes not just what people eat, but when. “Studies are starting to find an association between food choices in midlife and quality of life in later years,” said Ardisson Korat. “The more we can understand about healthy aging, the more science can help people live healthier for longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3555" data-end="3902"&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/recipes/beans-marbella-with-salty-roasted-potatoes" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjMyMTg3L1ZlZ05ld3MuQmVhbnNNYXJiZWxsYS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEzNjB4Iix7ImZvcm1hdCI6bnVsbH1dLFsicCIsIm9wdGltaXplIl1d/VegNews.BeansMarbella.jpg?sha=98dcdf2aff3af823" alt="VegNews.BeansMarbella"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3904" data-end="4194"&gt;Past studies have already linked plant-based diets to a reduced risk of chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. But this is one of the first large-scale studies to analyze how carbohydrate intake during midlife relates directly to overall aging outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4196" data-end="4508"&gt;Still, the authors caution that the findings have limitations. The study population consisted mostly of white female nurses, which may not reflect the experiences of more diverse populations. Additional research is needed to determine whether the associations hold across racial, socioeconomic, and gender lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4196" data-end="4508"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4510" data-end="4788"&gt;And while the findings offer compelling associations, they do not confirm causality. More research is required to explore the specific biological mechanisms at play—particularly how fiber and carbohydrate quality influence inflammation, &lt;a href="https://vegnews.com/vegan-gut-health-recipes" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, and cellular aging processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4510" data-end="4788"&gt;Diets for an aging population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4790" data-end="5266"&gt;The study was supported by the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service through a cooperative agreement, as well as by the National Institutes of Health. The Nurses’ Health Study, which began tracking 121,700 nurses in 1976, has been instrumental in shaping dietary guidelines and public health policies for nearly five decades. Its comprehensive datasets allow researchers to track long-term trends across a wide array of lifestyle and health variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4790" data-end="5266"&gt;&lt;img src="https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjUyNzAxL29sZGVyIHdvbWFuIHRhbGtzIHRvIHlvdW5nZXIgd29tYW4uanBnIl0sWyJwIiwib3B0aW1pemUiXV0/older%20woman%20talks%20to%20younger%20woman.jpg?sha=2f78dc4ee52b5bb7" alt="older woman talks to younger woman"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="5268" data-end="5642"&gt;With interest in healthy aging and longevity booming—particularly among aging Gen Xers and Millennials now entering midlife—these findings add new urgency to rethinking the role of carbohydrates in the diet. While low-carb trends such as keto and paleo continue to dominate consumer markets, studies like this one are helping to clarify that not all carbs are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="5644" data-end="5812"&gt;Instead, the new longevity conversation may start with fiber-rich fruits, ancient grains, beans, and vegetables—not with eliminating carbs, but choosing the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

And all the other kids went to sleep.” This was most odd. “I was thinking: ‘Didn’t we just get here?’” Even then, White didn’t sleep much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Today White, from California, is 82. Which means that, in the years since, she has spent perhaps a decade longer conscious than her average contemporary from childhood. Last night, a pretty normal night, she went to bed at 2.30am and got up at 5.30am. And she feels great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="cb4187e5-7214-4ec8-8685-bb565289dbab"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Experts say people with a similar condition to White not only sleep less but also sleep better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;NATHAN WEYLAND FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“My brain doesn’t get tired, and my body doesn’t get tired. Everybody around me gets tired.&lt;span&gt; I wear everybody out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She also now knows why. A new scientific paper has argued she has a gene mutation that is, for her, a sort of superpower. It makes her a “natural short sleeper”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ying-Hui Fu, from the University of California San Francisco and the author of that paper, has worked with dozens of such people. And they are more than curiosities. She thinks they could hold the key to improving all our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“What I learnt from these people is that it is possible for humans to do this. They can live a happy, active, healthy, long life.” Somehow, their quality of sleep is such that they simply don’t need as much. Imagine, she said, if every person in the world were able to sleep less but receive better results from it? Imagine if all those &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weekend-lie-ins-lower-risk-heart-disease-sleep-w80b6g7ls" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;conditions linked to poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; — Alzheimer’s, obesity, cancer — could be staved off? “We just have to figure out how.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-cant-i-sleep-bedroom-changes-p20lswspd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why can’t I sleep? Make these 5 changes to your bedroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For White, the diagnosis explains so much. It explains why she once spent 72 hours playing bridge. “After three days, I wasn’t tired. It’s a very bizarre way to live.” It explains why she is still so active — at her retirement community she teaches English as a second language, sits on committees, fixes tech products and runs a volunteer programme. “I’m always busy. My mind won’t shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It explains why, when she first got married, she found her husband to be so inexplicably indolent that one Sunday morning she threw a glass of water in his face while he slept in. “I only did it once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It also, though, poses a question. Why, if she doesn’t need to sleep so much, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/why-your-brain-needs-slow-wave-sleep-health-advice-2024-lgrpl58k2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;do the rest of us&lt;/a&gt;? This is what Fu wants to understand. We know sleep is extremely important. “When we are asleep our bodies remove toxins, clear up all the bad stuff, repair all the damages and all this is critical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While studying White several years ago, Fu recorded her sleeping for a relatively luxuriant six hours. White said this slothfulness could be explained by an undiagnosed thyroid problem.

              &lt;p&gt;A pivotal medical milestone has been reached. For the first time ever, researchers have used a personalized CRISPR-based gene therapy to treat an infant’s rare and life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine detailed their achievement in a study &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The treated child, named KJ, was born with a metabolic disorder known to kill up to 50% of children in their infancy. Now, three months after his first dose, KJ appears to have responded well to the treatment and is doing better than ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs,” said Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, director of the Gene Therapy for Inherited Metabolic Disorders Frontier Program at CHOP, in a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after his birth last summer, KJ was diagnosed with severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/carbamoyl-phosphate-synthetase-i-deficiency/"&gt;CPS1&lt;/a&gt;) deficiency. The disorder prevents his liver from producing a key enzyme that breaks down ammonia, a common waste product, into urea (which is then flushed out in urine). Because of this, ammonia levels continue to build up, eventually causing organ damage. While rare, CPS1 can be caused by a variety of different mutations, meaning that cases often don’t share the same genetic cause.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Certain treatments, including a strict low-protein diet, can help keep ammonia levels down in people with CPS1, but around half of those who develop it as infants die within the first week (cases that emerge later in life have a much higher survival rate). Until now, the only curative treatment available for CPS1 was a liver transplant. But babies like KJ typically have to wait until they’re old enough to survive the intensive procedure, during which time they’re vulnerable to the severe complications of CPS1, including permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, though, researchers at CHOP and Penn Medicine had been trying to rapidly develop customized gene therapies for people with rare genetic diseases. And KJ seemed like the perfect test case for their emerging approach. With permission from his parents and eventually the Food and Drug Administration, the team set to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of just six months, the researchers crafted, tested, and treated KJ with his own personalized gene-editing drug. The therapy uses a form of CRISPR—delivered to his liver cells using lipid nanoparticles—to edit a specific base (bases being the building blocks, or letters, of DNA) in the defective gene responsible for KJ’s condition. The goal is to repair the defect and allow his liver to break down ammonia as usual. The therapy was first tested in mice and then monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;KJ was initially given a low dose of the gene therapy, codenamed k-abe, in February 2025. After he appeared to tolerate it well, he received two higher doses in March and April with no apparent serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the months since, he’s been able to ingest increasing amounts of protein and he’s required lower doses of another treatment used to manage the condition. He did experience several common childhood infections during this time period, which can be life-threatening in people with CPS1, but he recovered with no major issues—another promising sign.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It will take time to know whether the therapy is safe over the long term, however, or if KJ might require additional treatments. But for now, everything seems to be working just as hoped. And KJ’s story is ideally only the start. The researchers believe their approach can be tweaked to treat a wide array of ultra-rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If so, KJ’s success might herald a new era of personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want each and every patient to have the potential to experience the same results we saw in this first patient, and we hope that other academic investigators will replicate this method for many rare diseases and give many patients a fair shot at living a healthy life,” said Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist at Penn Medicine and lead author of the NEJM paper, in a &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The promise of gene therapy that we’ve heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it’s going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Known as HEALS—Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics—this model proposes that psychedelics disrupt the typical hierarchy between hemispheres, releasing the more holistic, emotionally intelligent right side from left-brain control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging shows a rightward shift in brain activity under psychedelics, aligning with traits often enhanced during these experiences, like mindfulness, empathy, and clarity. Research also finds parallels between the effects of psychedelics and practices like meditation, which also strengthen right-hemisphere networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEALS Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Proposes that psychedelics shift dominance from the left to the right hemisphere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Right-brain dominance may enhance empathy, creativity, and insight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuroimaging shows increased right-hemisphere activity under psychedelics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret to psychedelic drugs’ links to greater empathy and insight may lie in their ability to coax the right hemisphere of the brain into a position of dominance over the left, according to a proposed new theory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researcher Adam Levin combined his experience in therapeutic psychedelics research and psychiatric training with a review of imaging, numerous studies and previous models to support his proposal, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, Levin emphasizes not what the two brain hemispheres do, but how they approach a topic or task – working in parallel, with left-brain dominance, during typical modes of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re solving a problem, or, evolutionarily speaking, hunting for food, for example, the scope of attention differs: The left hemisphere focuses on manipulation of individual parts while the right hemisphere maintains a big-picture frame of reference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the psychedelic state, there’s a unique combination of the hemispheres coming together in a way that doesn’t usually happen in normal states of consciousness,” said Levin, a postdoctoral scholar and psychiatrist in the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education in The Ohio State University College of Social Work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost a new encounter between the left and the right hemispheres’ way of thinking and perceiving the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He calls this model of psychedelic action HEALS: Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In effect, he suggests, psychedelics reverse the hierarchical relationship between the two hemispheres of the brain, releasing the right hemisphere from inhibition by the left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin was initially inspired in part by the writings of Iain McGilchrist, author of “The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his own clinical experience as a medical student and psychiatry resident gave Levin an up-close look at how disorders affecting one side of the brain or the other affected patients’ world view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people who lose the right hemisphere to stroke, the attentional window gets so narrow and they don’t even recognize a whole half of the world. Whereas people with an intact right hemisphere, who lose their left hemisphere, still have a broader general picture of things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these people’s experiences seem, to me, to be similar to what I’m seeing in my psychedelic research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous hypotheses about psychedelics’ effects on the brain have suggested “unrestrained cognition” occurs through the weakening of control exerted by frontal lobes and the top of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is likely true, Levin said, patterns observed in people’s reports of their psychedelic experiences suggest there’s more going on: There are increases in psychological flexibility, creativity, and social and emotional intelligence; greater empathy, harmony and connection; a broader attentional window toward novelty and “aliveness”; and clarity and insight about one’s basic existence and, in some cases, need for healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those general patterns are awfully similar to the pattern of the right hemisphere,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think psychedelics provide access to this whole picture, this whole view, that could have been operating in the background – and that’s this right hemisphere view. Restoration of this natural balance is an interesting way of explaining some of what’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies of lateral changes to brain blood flow and metabolism – brain regions’ use of glucose – that Levin analyzed showed signs of heavy activity in the frontal lobes in the right hemisphere as well as an overall rightward shift in metabolic activity under psychedelics, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing evidence that mindfulness meditation practice is linked to building new networks in the brain and increasing brain thickness in the right hemisphere is relevant to the HEALS theory, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychedelics have been linked to improvements in mindfulness with just one or two uses. And sometimes these capacities are almost at levels consistent with practiced meditators,” Levin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes it likely, to me, that many core right-sided networks that are enhanced with practicing meditation might be enhanced briefly, or maybe longer, through psychedelics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s an opportunity after the use of psychedelics to increase and sustain mindfulness capacities in these areas of the right hemisphere.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of psychedelic research is focused on therapeutic applications at Ohio State and elsewhere, but Levin expects that expansion of the field will stimulate pursuit of other research questions – including testing theories about how these substances act on the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He considers HEALS a complement to earlier theories about psychedelic action, and expects the growth in research to produce more hypotheses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think to explain something as complex as the brain, especially in the human being, you need a variety of theories to more closely approximate what’s actually happening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we get too fixated on one explanation or the other, we’re going to lose track of reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2142404d4556444d4d0f101410614e52540f444554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Caldwell – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811241303599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hemispheric annealing and lateralization under psychedelics (HEALS): A novel hypothesis of psychedelic action in the brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Levin et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemispheric annealing and lateralization under psychedelics (HEALS): A novel hypothesis of psychedelic action in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current models of psychedelic action in the brain propose changes along the dorsal–ventral and anterior–posterior axes but neglect to address the lateral axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article proposes a novel model of psychedelic action called HEALS (Hemispheric Annealing and Lateralization Under Psychedelics) which involves the reversal of the typical hierarchical relationship between the two hemispheres of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical modes of consciousness, the hemispheres act in parallel process with the left predominating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under psychedelics, as well as in other altered states of consciousness (ASCs), this hierarchy is reversed, with the right hemisphere released from inhibition by the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this model, the available neuroimaging evidence for lateralization under psychedelics is reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, various cognitive and emotional changes observed under psychedelics are contrasted with those same functions in each hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include attention; social and emotional intelligence; creativity and insight; and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article concludes with a review of laterality in other ASCs, such as meditative and trance states, and suggests that many phenomena associated with psychedelics, and other ASCs, might be explained by an atypical annealing between the hemispheres toward right hemisphere predominance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 14:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1QOVA2WExaZ1BsZmZib2FMXzVlbjdEVzB5QVpYcHc2YTRDems4RU5kbWtLVU1EdHFkOC1MNGZ4YnNjRWtiN3pLb0FEd3V4UU9FeVNIeXFtU0dUeGRNSjIzOVVBRjdCR2xGSkNETE1tWG5JZk3SAXhBVV95cUxNRnBiY3RKY0owdzV3TjVvRHpZTkNLeEE4S1Q3UHo5bG5KWW1zVmwyMDBJUkRNMkpRTVNqcS1feVg1RGFKUDQ5dTlIRlFqSjBFM092ejRZZzA3dlNUVWk2dFhvd19acDRHVUVVTG00SHBMTTZhSS1fbDU</guid></item><item><title>流行的注射减肥药物对单一性别更有效。研究人员想知道原因- CNN | Popular injected weight loss medications work better for one sex.

            You’ve probably heard the stories: For every man who has cut carbs from his diet and dropped 10 pounds, there’s a woman who’s done exactly the same thing and lost 2. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40100584/" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; backs up this frustrating fact. Diet and exercise tend to benefit men much more than women when it comes to losing weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00042e6adrvw10y4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why the results of recent clinical trials were surprising — and welcome — for some: In study after study, injected GLP-1 weight loss medications appear to work better on average for women than they do for men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc8d3n00033b6mqsm17tl1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s not clear is why. And researchers say it’s important to understand so doctors can optimize the use of these powerful drugs for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00052e6ao7pvpjeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" target="_blank"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; to see this effect was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Congress on Obesity and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoi2h7600063b6m32il0nu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was the first head-to-head comparison of the injectable GLP-1 medications semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are sold under the brand names Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss. Roughly 750 people with obesity were randomly split into two groups. Half were assigned to get the maximum dose of Wegovy they could tolerate; the other half used the maximum dose of Zepbound.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc9zb900053b6mer5ijmoq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zepbound is newer medication than Wegovy. It stimulates two different gut hormones that affect appetite and blood sugar, while Wegovy primarily affects the action of one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00072e6ab9a92eds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors have observed that Zepbound seems to be a more powerful medication than Wegovy, so it was not surprising when this trial – which was sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Zepbound – arrived at the same conclusion. People in the study who were using Zepbound lost about 50% more weight those who got Wegovy, making it the superior drug&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in terms of weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00082e6aadopkslk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One curious thing about the study was that all the participants lost a little bit less weight, on average, than has been measured with the same medications in other trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00092e6af9vua676@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers say that result was driven by men, who lost about 6% less weight than women. About 35% of participants in this study were men, while 20% to 25% of participants in previous trials have been male.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000a2e6alfszdy69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why this works better in women, I can’t honestly tell you, but it’s great,” said Dr. Louis Aronne, who directs the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and who led the study. “It has been seen again and again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000b2e6ay99ex51q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11271387/" target="_blank"&gt;long-term follow up&lt;/a&gt; of a trial that compared semaglutide to a placebo, women using semaglutide for two years lost an average of 11% of their starting weight, while men using the drug lost an average of 8%. Across &lt;a href="https://www.easd.org/media-centre/#!resources/b-body-weight-reduction-with-tirzepatide-by-sex-a-subgroup-analysis-of-the-surmount-clinical-trials-b-8475ab5a-d4b6-4545-b9c5-ad8b1c8a266e" target="_blank"&gt;trials of tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; that compared it to a placebo, women on the drug lost up to 28% of their starting weight, while men lost up to 19% of their weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000c2e6abpypxpyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There could be a host of reasons for this, spanning numerous aspects of biology and culture, said Dr. Melanie Jay, an obesity expert and professor of medicine at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000d2e6abzz464bd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first has to do with drug dosing. Women tend to weigh a little bit less than men but are prescribed the same doses, so it may be that they’re getting more for their size. “So maybe they’re getting a higher dose,” Jay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000e2e6avz82zumq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It might also have something to do with where women store fat. Jay said women tend to have more cutaneous fat, or fat under their skin, than visceral fat, or fat that’s packed around the internal organs like the liver. Perhaps the drugs are more effective on one type of fat than the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000f2e6abhrg32iw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women also face more societal pressure to be thin, Jay said, and this could lead to greater motivation to stay on the medications, which aren’t always easy to take.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000g2e6af62rvj44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jay said she’s seen this in her own practice. Women seem to be more willing to tolerate and work through the significant side effects of the drugs, which can include regular nausea, vomiting and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000h2e6aqjn0s081@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have had a few more men be like, ‘I can’t take the constipation or the nausea,’ whereas the women usually figure out how to get through it,” Jay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000i2e6aypgrg267@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the side effects tend to get better over time, as people learn how to eat differently and start to exercise more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000j2e6ajgnrgifu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the most intriguing clues to explain why women benefit more from the GLP-1 medications has to do with the hormone estrogen, which women have in higher amounts than men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000k2e6atiqif4hl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Karolina Skibicka is a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Gothenberg in Sweden and has a lab in the nutrition department at Penn State University. “Overall, I’m a neuroscientist interested in gut-brain communication,” which is how she began studying GLP-1, a gut hormone that also works in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000m2e6amvr8j3ui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Skibicka says scientists have known that estrogen plays a role in metabolism for about 30 years, but they didn’t really understand how. Her research in rats has shown that estrogen directly interacts with GLP-1 and other gut hormones, making them more potent in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000o2e6au3wxlyj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several studies have shown that if you inject rats with GLP-1 and estrogen together, “you will see a very enhanced effect sort of across the board, on feeding behavior, motivated behavior, various other aspects of GLP-1 actions,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000p2e6acu65yl4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can test this interaction in a another way, she said. If you block the action of estrogen with a chemical inhibitor, it turns down the effect of GLP-1, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000q2e6ai9ybkbr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we take it away, the effect is reduced, so the animals will eat a little bit more now, or GLP-1 is just not as effective as suppressing feeding or suppressing food reward behavior, maybe more specifically, when we take away estrogen,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000r2e6abnybakm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Estrogen appears to amplify the effects of GLP-1 by increasing the number of receptors — think of them as boat docks — on the surface of cells where this gut hormone can attach. In many tissues, she says, cells have receptors for both estrogen and GLP-1. “So then you sort of have an amplified effect inside the cell as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000s2e6acvyfg7bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although all of these theories are interesting, they are just educated guesses at this point.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000u2e6avg8bm40p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re really dealing with paucity of data compared to just sort of the baseline data that you have about what GLP-1 does,” Skibicka said. “Clinical studies don’t really ask and don’t really confirm why they see a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000t2e6ay7od5e29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Jay and Skibicka said sex differences typically go unexplored when it comes to drugs, and the GLP-1 medications are no exception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000v2e6ankn3wycf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In studies that do report data by sex, women may lose 50% to 90% more weight than men, but they also seem to report more GI side effects, Skibicka said. Men seem to get more cardiovascular benefits from the medications than women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000w2e6a82emqtbw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although most studies don’t find that GLP-1 medications negatively affect mood,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;some have shown that this may differ by sex, with women being more likely to experience depression on the medications than men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc5ikw00003b6mpf97ludf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Understanding the impacts of these sex differences could be important for all patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000x2e6aahuuph1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If estrogen affects how strongly the medications work, that may have implications for the treatment of women before or after menopause&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;since estrogen levels fall in women as they age. It may also impact how well GLP-1 medications work for women on hormone-blocking therapies after breast cancer, for example. It may lead to strategies that help nonresponders, the people who don’t seem to lose weight on the drugs, and people who stop losing weight before they reach their weight loss goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000y2e6aqugxjdzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jay said that understanding the mechanisms behind the sex differences could help with adherence to the medications, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000z2e6ajpbhma2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think those things are really important to know, because maybe there’s something else that we could give men alongside it that could enhance it … or we could change the dosing,” Jay said. “Men and women have different biologies, and we can’t treat them always the same.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This warning comes on the back of a study last year, which found 85 percent of spatulas, takeaway tubs and other kitchen utensils made from &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-13259577/fireproof-chemicals-exposure-raises-cancer-death-risk-study.html"&gt;recycled black plastic contained fireproof substances&lt;/a&gt; linked to numerous health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other substances of concern that the team noted included perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), also known as ‘forever chemicals'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to the chemicals and PFAS have been linked to multiple cancers, asthma, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fertility/index.html" id="mol-3cac5000-f8ec-11ee-98d7-734d9a0fe2d9"&gt;fertility&lt;/a&gt; problems, obesity, birth defects, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-3cabb3c0-f8ec-11ee-98d7-734d9a0fe2d9"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BPA-bisphenol A-and phthalates, both of which are substances used in modern plastic manufacturing were other examples highlighted in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors also said chemicals seeping into food was a particular concern when it comes to ultra-processed foods (UPFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPF is an umbrella term used to cover anything edible made with colourings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ready meals, ice cream and tomato ketchup are some of the best-loved examples of these products, which often also come in plastic packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chemicals found in modern food packaging have been linked to a host of health problems including cancer, infertility, birth defects, developmental delays as well as increased risk of kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Britain is the worst nation in Europe when it comes to UPF consumption, with the food group making an estimated 57 per cent of the national diet. The figure estimated to be even higher in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'UPFs are generally prepackaged and kept for several weeks, months or even years in their packaging,' the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many are even directly heated in their packaging (for example, ready-to-eat dishes in plastic trays reheated in the microwave), enhancing the migration of FCCs ( chemicals) into food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added that the processing that occurs to create these foods in massive industrial cooking processes could also be exposing them to plastic materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author of the report, Jane Muncke added that while research on the harms posed by UPFs was still ongoing, data was strong enough that governments should act to limit their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The evidence is becoming more and more clear that today’s packaged ultra-processed foods are convenient and hyperpalatable, but they contain many synthetic chemicals and microplastics from various sources,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We see that the health impacts of this type of food contamination are currently under-appreciated and under-studied.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic from Toxic Free Future shows how toxic PFAS chemicals get into food products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through. Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Processed culinary ingredients — which are usually not eaten alone — include oils, butter, sugar and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Britain is the worst nation in Europe when it comes to UPF consumption, with the food group making an estimated 57 per cent of the national diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The figure is estimated to be even higher in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concluding their report, published in &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03697-5"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the team recommended developing food packaging materials that do not pose the same risk to customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Human exposure to chemicals can be reduced by a systematic shift away from materials that are known to release the most synthetic chemicals and microplastics into foodstuffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These include paper and board, plastics and coated metals.'&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each extra 100 grams (3.5 ounces) a day  of ultra-processed foods was linked with a 14.5 percent higher risk of high blood pressure, 5.9 percent increased risk of cardiovascular events, 1.2 percent increased risk of cancer, 19.5 percent higher risk of digestive diseases and 2.6 percent higher risk of dying from any cause, according to the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There was also a link between eating ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and depression or anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Reducing ultra-processed foods intake, even modestly, may offer measurable health benefits,” study co-author Xiao Liu, MD, a cardiologist at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2025/05/08/14/10/Eating-Ultra-Processed-Foods-May-Harm-Your-Health" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2025/05/08/14/10/Eating-Ultra-Processed-Foods-May-Harm-Your-Health" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="statement" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-the-brain-degeneration-study-find" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;What did the brain degeneration study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This study was published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="14.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213562" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213562" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neurology" data-node-id="14.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and analyzed data from nearly 43,000 people with an average age of 48 who didn’t have Parkinson’s disease at the start of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The participants were followed for 26 years, during which time they completed regular medical exams, filled out food diaries, and answered health questionnaires. The researchers divided the participants into five groups based on how much ultra-processed foods they ate per day. They discovered that people who ate 11 or more servings of ultra-processed foods a day had a 2.5 times higher risk of having three or more early signs of Parkinson’s disease than those who had less than three servings a day. (Those early signs included things like rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, constipation, depressive symptoms, body pain, impaired color vision, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a reduced ability to smell.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's important to point out that what the researchers counted as a "serving" can really add up. Like, one tablespoon of ketchup is a serving, and so is an ounce of potato chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the study didn’t find that ultra-processed foods &lt;em data-node-id="17.1"&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; people to develop Parkinson’s disease, the researchers pointed out that these early symptoms tend to come before a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-ultra-processed-foods-affect-your-heart-and-brain" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;Why might ultra-processed foods affect your heart and brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few potential biological things going on here that could be resulting in this data that links ultra-processed foods with heart and brain health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“It is thought that ultra-processed foods affect cardiovascular health through multiple mechanisms, including promotion of inflammation, increasing oxidative stress, and increasing insulin resistance,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cheng-Han Chen, MD" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. This can cause damage to blood vessels, create a build-up of plaque in your arteries—and raise the risk of heart attack or stroke, he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But despite the health risks, ultra-processed foods can be hard to resist, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/daniel-d-truong" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/daniel-d-truong" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daniel Truong, MD" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Daniel Truong, MD&lt;/a&gt;, neurologist and medical director of the Truong Neuroscience Institute at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence"&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; is a broad term encompassing many different subtypes, from apps that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-unveils-powerful-new-ai-said-to-out-think-chatgpt"&gt;write poetry&lt;/a&gt; to algorithms that are able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-combed-millions-of-images-of-the-arctic-it-found-an-alarming-pattern"&gt;spot patterns&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise get missed – and now AI modeling has just played a major role in an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) used AI to discover that a gene recognized as a sign of Alzheimer's disease could be causing it too. It highlights one of the big challenges in the study of Alzheimer's: understanding both the changes the disease causes, and the changes that cause the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enzyme called phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), and the gene that encodes it, were the focus here. The researchers had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2022.02.008"&gt;previously established&lt;/a&gt; the gene was typically more active in people with faster-progressing Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161111" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic.jpg" alt="PHGDH graphic" class="wp-image-161111 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161111" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study looked at the influence of the PHGDH gene. (Zhong lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What wasn't clear was what was driving this link. The team used AI to model the structure of the PHGDH enzyme more fully, suggesting it had a previously hidden function: flicking switches for other specific genes on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed PHGDH interacting with two genes inside brain cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"&gt;known as astrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, in ways that interfere with the brain's ability to regulate inflammation and clear out waste. The researchers think this could be one of the tipping points triggering Alzheimer's, and explaining the association between PHGDH and the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; bioengineer Sheng Zhong, from UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team investigated ways to inhibit PHGDH, but only partly – ideally, a drug would block its ability to regulate genes in astrocytes, while still allowing it to perform its vital enzymatic role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found a molecule called NCT-503 that fit the bill. AI modeling was deployed again to examine the structure of this molecule, and how it interacts with PHGDH. NCT-503 seems to bind to a pocket in PHGDH to stop its unauthorized gene-switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go before an actual Alzheimer's drug might be developed from this finding, but the research has shown that a treatment based on NCT-503 can put up guardrails around PHGDH in mouse models of the disease. The mice that were treated showed improvements in memory and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;anxiety tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, NCT-503 is able to pass the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; to access neurons and their associated cells, making the new treatment research even more promising. Drugs based on the molecule could even be taken orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's taking time to unpick the complexities of Alzheimer's disease, and all the different factors involved in its development – from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stressful-life-events-linked-to-alzheimers-biomarkers-study-finds"&gt;environmental stresses&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;inherited genetics&lt;/a&gt; – each new study gets us a step closer to solutions, and improving how we tackle the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer's disease are very limited," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhong. "And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When these neurons were silenced in diabetic mice, blood sugar normalized for months, even without changes in weight or food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges long-standing beliefs that obesity and insulin resistance are the sole drivers of diabetes. The findings suggest that targeting brain circuits could become a powerful new approach to treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Silencing hyperactive AgRP neurons reversed diabetes in mice without affecting weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent of Obesity:&lt;/strong&gt; Diabetes remission occurred despite unchanged food intake and body mass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting brain cells may offer a new strategy for diabetes treatment beyond current drug approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Successfully treating type 2 diabetes may involve focusing on brain neurons, rather than simply concentrating on obesity or insulin resistance, according to a study published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years, researchers have known that hyperactivity of a subset of neurons located in the hypothalamus, called AgRP neurons, is common in mice with diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110006"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-rewiring-diabetes-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;He noted, for instance, that Ozempic and other new drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes are also able to inhibit AgRP neurons. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurons are playing an outsized role in hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes,” said UW Medicine endocrinologist Dr. Michael Schwartz, corresponding author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if these neurons contribute to elevated blood sugar in diabetic mice, researchers employed a widely used viral genetics approach to make AgRP neurons express tetanus toxin, which prevents the neurons from communicating with other neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, this intervention normalized high blood sugar for months, despite having no effect on body weight or food consumption.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom is that diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, stems from a combination of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors, including obesity, lack of physical activity and poor diet. This mix of factors leads to insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, scientists have traditionally thought the brain doesn’t play a role in type 2 diabetes, according to Schwartz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he paper challenges this and is a “departure from the conventional wisdom of what causes diabetes,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings align with studies published by the same scientists showing that injection of a peptide called FGF1 directly into the brain also causes diabetes remission in mice. This effect was subsequently shown to involve sustained inhibition of AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the data suggest that, while these neurons are important for controlling blood sugar in diabetes, they don’t play a major role in causing obesity in these mice, the researchers noted in their report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, targeting these neurons may not reverse obesity, even as it causes diabetes to go into remission, Schwartz explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed on how to regulate activity in these neurons, and how they become hyperactive in the first place, he said. Once these questions are answered, Schwartz said that a therapeutic approach might then be developed to calm them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could represent a shift in how clinicians understand and treat this chronic disease, Schwartz said.  He noted, for instance, that Ozempic and other new drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes are also able to inhibit AgRP neurons.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent to which this effect contributes to the antidiabetic action of these drugs is unknown. Further research might help scientists to better understand the role of AgRP neurons in how the body normally controls blood sugar, and to ultimately translate these findings into human clinical trials, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz holds the UW Robert H. Williams Endowed Chair in Medicine and is a UW professor of medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition, and an adjunct professor of laboratory medicine and pathology.

Convergent evidence implicates inhibition of a particular subset of neurons as a mediator of this FGF1 effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, AgRP neurons, which are located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and are hyperactive in Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and other rodent models of T2D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether chronic AgRP neuron inactivation mimics the antidiabetic action of FGF1, we directed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a cre-inducible tetanus toxin–GFP (TeTx-GFP) cassette (or cre-inducible AAV GFP control) to the ARC of obese, diabetic male Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in which cre recombinase is expressed solely by AgRP neurons (Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; AgRP-Cre mice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report that over a 10-wk period of observation, hyperglycemia was fully normalized by AgRP neuron inactivation. In contrast, changes in energy homeostasis parameters (food intake, energy expenditure, body weight, and fat mass) were not observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that in diabetic male Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, AgRP neuron hyperactivity is required for hyperglycemia but is dispensable for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:59:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5WYm5VajhKa08zVnZXZUhtcUNmcUZWaG50a2FLcWk4VGNkTUtrcGVlMGZtNGFXWkgwenB3RFNCWUV2RFdsNnFELVh3bFJ2ZDdLWVcyb3U4Yk9UZXJiOHgxR1hRWFFBQQ</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界高血压日：医生分享管理高血压的7个生活方式技巧-印度斯坦时报 | World Hypertension Day 2025: Doctor shares 7 lifestyle tips to manage high blood pressure - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxNMWZrNVBSUVlyVURLbzM4cVBNOXMwenJZa09xTUhOZlZwdEVHczI3VzliVGY4b2d5WHR3eUtaTHZiZWFjTDJaVTl2ZzFQQUhObXI2a0F1dURVMFR6UVhSWFlod2xpbHdnc1dWWmZfemVKYjktWXlsYWpUbDdkYTU1ZFE1WENtdUo3dTVQRU8ycF9zdF9YYThuWmg3VXBDeTluNm9mR01HYWQyRkpubzFXOEI5emNkcnBYSEp2ZDREdDRiZ2s0bHVFeEdwNkdjLXhmREUwSWhDUWdoZEIwNEl4SEp4OURxUWI4ODFnOVZR0gHzAUFVX3lxTE9xcHR3VGpNZVlsbVRaUVZON2JKQmdTOTlOZnRrWm90dkxtZTJQLVdnM0RwYnBhMlJPR1Y2ZWxPY1pDb0czWDF3emhPYnhLcG5pdm1PNEVTdFg0Vm5LQk9UMHlIMnQ5MkRTTlpVWnhULS1IdW5oa1BvblJpc0l0Sm0xcW9ZMWtPS0sxclNVU3l4UnJhSVBFMFI0SktGaXVKYVdjZTFFQUlmbEZ1cU1rckhLbUtCNGw5dF82Qy1mS2dVNkhudVlGaW9qWFFVSUZWWFJuWUpveFp2UV9fY1BoazM0X3VkcjVjTmRRbUJneGtUT25fVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/world-hypertension-day-2025-doctor-shares-7-lifestyle-tips-to-manage-high-blood-pressure-101747395296198.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is often called a silent killer, it can quietly pave the way for serious health issues, including heart disease and other chronic conditions.

Keep a healthy weight:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much body weight overworks the heart and raises blood pressure. Try to have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9. Reducing even a little weight can decrease blood pressure markedly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Follow a balanced diet:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy foods. Use less than 5 grams of salt daily. Cut back on saturated fats and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Exercise daily:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active for a minimum of 30 minutes every day, most days. Regular activity like brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or yoga maintains blood pressure at a healthy level. Exercise also lowers stress levels, another cause of hypertension. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/struggling-with-hypertension-this-new-kidney-based-treatment-could-be-a-gamechanger-101737210859592.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Struggling with hypertension?

Reduce alcohol and stop smoking:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy drinking can increase blood pressure and harm the heart. Smoking clogs arteries and puts more strain on the heart. Stopping smoking makes a significant impact on cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Manage stress:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Managed Chronic stress is a cause of high blood pressure. Practice relaxation skills like deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness. Get enough sleep and maintain work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Check blood pressure often:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your readings in check, particularly if you have a family history. Use a home monitor or see a healthcare provider regularly for check-ups. Early detection is crucial to successful management. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/indian-lifestyle-and-hypertension-5-key-modifications-to-keep-blood-pressure-and-heart-health-in-check-101718954305989.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Managing hypertension in India: Adopt these 5 lifestyle tweaks for better heart health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing hypertension in India: Adopt these 5 lifestyle tweaks for better heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.

A new study overturns this long-held view, revealing that astrocytes—support cells long considered secondary—are the key intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When norepinephrine is released in the brain, astrocytes detect it and release their own chemical messengers, dampening synaptic activity and reorganizing neuronal connections. Even when neurons can’t sense norepinephrine, these changes persist, as long as astrocytes remain responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrocyte Mediation:&lt;/strong&gt; Norepinephrine reorganizes brain activity through astrocytes, not neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic Dampening:&lt;/strong&gt; Astrocytes release a secondary signal that weakens synaptic connections in response to norepinephrine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting astrocytes may improve treatment of attention and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have upended decades-old dogma of how connections between brain cells are rearranged during states of heightened vigilance or attention. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that a brain chemical associated with alertness, attention and learning alters brain connectivity and function not by acting directly on neurons, the cells known for their quick transmission of information, but through the work of astrocytes, another, slower-acting type of brain cell that is often overlooked in the field of neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; May 15, fundamentally changes current understanding about the determinants of brain network communication and activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls for greater focus on astrocytes as therapeutic targets in the treatment of attention, memory and emotional disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Textbooks tell us that neuromodulators like norepinephrine fine-tune neurons directly — in fact, textbooks tell us that everything in the brain is about neurons,” said Thomas Papouin, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at WashU Medicine and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems that a lot of brain wiring and activity is probably orchestrated by astrocytes, on slower timescales. This is the type of discovery that profoundly reshapes our understanding of how the brain works.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the brain’s wallflower to center stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the brain to dedicate itself to tasks that need attention, or to respond to unexpected stimuli like a fire alarm, it needs to be able to rewire itself by changing how brain cells communicate. This process is driven by the release of chemicals known as neuromodulators, including norepinephrine, in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these neuromodulators reorganize communication in the brain is poorly understood. The assumption for the past 80 years has been that neuromodulator chemicals act on neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for at least 30 years astrocytes have been shown to contact and interact with synapses, which are the specialized structures where neurons communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long suspected that astrocytes had the potential to rearrange communication between neurons and, therefore, the flow of information in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their very fine and sprawling shape, these cells are ideally positioned to monitor and detect neuromodulators like norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to test the idea that perhaps neuromodulation of synapses by norepinephrine is an astrocyte business,” Papouin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, Papouin and his team stimulated norepinephrine secretion from mouse brain cells or exposed mouse brain slices to norepinephrine and found that norepinephrine weakened connections between neurons, as known for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers found that norepinephrine also triggered activity among surrounding astrocytes. Once triggered by norepinephrine, astrocytes produced a second chemical that they released onto synapses, which caused the dampening of synapse activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when neurons’ ability to directly sense norepinephrine was removed, norepinephrine was still able to rearrange neuronal connections. When astrocytes’ ability to sense or respond to norepinephrine were taken offline, on the other hand, norepinephrine was unable to reorganize neuronal connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that neuromodulators such as norepinephrine rearrange neuronal connections in the brain by signaling through astrocytes rather than directly onto neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also suggest that targeting astrocytes could be an effective way to reshape brain activity to potentially treat brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papouin’s team has started looking at existing drugs that are believed to act on neurons, to see if they require astrocytes to be effective. If so, perhaps astrocytes could be targeted directly for therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many drugs out there that interfere with norepinephrine signaling in the brain, in particular in the treatment of ADHD or depression. I wonder how many of them require astrocytes to modify brain activity,” said Papouin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health grants R01MH127163-01, R01DK128475, R01NS102272 and R01HL31113-30, Department of Defense grant W911NF-21-1-0312, The Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation, NARSAD Young Investigator Award 28616, The Whitehall Foundation grant 2020-08-35 and The McDonnell Center for Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology Award 22-3930-26275U.

Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:30:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBfY0M3MlByLTlINU9SVWNkamFvbEY3VG5KV0VGeGpaQWVfcUZaQWI5NEMyNlJHYWVDdGk1bGJQN1ZHWWpIVE9oMHlxOW5adjNZNEFPWVJQcVVtUDd6ck9DVnJWRlBjajNaYTVKbXB0aHRiTUxy</guid></item><item><title>专家说，鲜为人知的指尖变化是致命癌症正在上升的早期迹象-每日邮报 | Little-known change to your FINGERTIPS is an early sign of deadly cancer that's on the rise, experts say - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics and campaigners have warned the public to pay attention to changes to their fingertips, as a specific alteration could be a red flag sign of lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b86201f0-323d-11f0-85df-17851093755f"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well-recognised signs of the deadly disease include a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14710921/non-smoker-lung-cancer-sign-shoulder-pain.html"&gt; persistent cough&lt;/a&gt; and breathlessness, but experts have now flagged a lesser-known, unusual symptom that affects the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Swelling in the fingertips, known medically as finger clubbing, is a known sign of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to be a result of a number of factors, including substances released by certain lung tumours that inflame the bones in the fingers, and harmful chemicals produced by the body that fuel cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem can appear as swollen fingers, as well as a change in the shape of the nail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, a former patient whose only symptom was finger clubbing has warned others to be aware of the unusual sign and take action quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Go and see your doctor—that's what a GP is for,' Brian Gemmell, a fitness instructor from East Kilbride, Scotland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/lung-cancer-doctors-say-early-35229827"&gt;The Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. 'Go as soon as you can.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Gemell previously told The Roy Castle Lung Foundation that he suffered no cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Telltale signs of finger clubbing include softening of the nail, red and shiny skin around the nail and ridges along the length of it, according to Cancer Research UK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I was feeling healthy,' he said. 'I wasn’t coughing up blood, I wasn’t breathless. My one and only symptom was clubbing of the fingers, where all your fingers swell up and when you put your fingers together you can’t see a diamond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was my only symptom. Straightaway, my GP had an idea of what it was. He sent me straight for a chest X-ray and referred me to a respiratory consultant.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Gemell then underwent surgery and other treatment, and now lives with stage three lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his surgery he re-trained as a personal fitness instructor, working predominantly with cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend using an at-home screening tool known as a Schamroth window test to check for finger clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involves pressing two opposing fingers back-to-back against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you can't see a diamond-shape window of light between the nail beds and the nails of the two fingers, this could be an indication of finger clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a 2012 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519022/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Malay Sarkar, an India-based lung cancer specialist, lung cancer is the primary cause of clubbing, contributing to nearly 90 per cent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK with around 48,500 people diagnosed every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, he estimates that 5-15 per cent of people with lung cancer develop nail clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Sarkar's study, clubbing seems to occur in different stages, starting at the base of the nail, which becomes soft and spongy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It usually affects both hands, causing redness of the skin around the nail—known as erythema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The angle between the nail bed and the skin just below the cuticle then becomes noticeably bigger, causing the nail to curve more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, Dr Sarkar notes, the nail and the surrounding skin will look shiny and the nail will have ridges along the length of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the finger develops a clubbed appearance. While the condition typically takes years to develop, it can happen quicker if there is certain complications such as a lung infection, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/mesothelioma/symptoms/finger-clubbing#:~:text=Finger%20clubbing%20can%20be%20a,ulcerative%20colitis%20and%20Crohn's%20disease."&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt; warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, extra areas of bone can form on the finger joints, wrists and even ankles—a condition which is known as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA), and is often mistaken for arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of lung cancer are often not noticeable until the cancer has spread through the lungs, to other parts of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone with finger clubbing will have lung cancer, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the charity advises those who think they may have it to contact their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes as Figures from Cancer Research UK show cases of all types of lung cancer have risen by 130 per cent in young women over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes them the fastest growing group at risk of the disease — although over-70s are still most likely to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates among men of the same age have barely budged from the early 90s, for reasons that medics say are simply unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have warned against viewing the deadliest form of cancer as a disease that predominately affects old people—as it has previously been seen—as cases rise among never-smokers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, lung cancer in people who have never smoked is now the fifth highest cause of cancer deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the cancer include a persistent cough that doesn't go away after three weeks, repeated chest infections, coughing up blood, pain while breathing, persistent breathlessness and fatigue, and unexpected weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other, more unusual signs of lung cancer include change in the appearance of your fingers, difficulty or pain swallowing, wheezing, changes in your voice, and swelling of the face or neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 11:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我从小就忽略了致命脑癌的惊人迹象-现在我生活在刀刃上-每日邮报 | The surprising signs of my deadly brain cancer that I've ignored since childhood - now I live on a knife's edg - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQM1V5eUZkQldhTjFyMmtkMjY0RExOelNTYnYxb2NZT281Y2puTXRWb3BxX20yS213TkxyV0NPMU9zTmQxNmMxUElwZWtXeUVNejVHLXA4Q3BMNkxnVDN2Tkl0V1B2MFFsRnlscFlsQ1BzOXY5MGd0dHZISk95WWs4ZWNrSDZCNjE4YmhULXVibVQ5eGIzTzRWaHNvWFY3eUxpOGIwYlluRHNnUThP0gGyAUFVX3lxTE45UnZwMFFqcWlFQUE5Yzk3VzhQT3VSVDBlb1YwT1hLLXJaOUJUOF9OaDg1TnRHSERGVTVxbk1xb2lKWE1IbWQyVy1nM3g2NEZpcWlYcTc2S1d1QS1scmV0QzEtQ0JLSXVyZkF5bDlhSFpBZUJXcG5zWXBST05PT29SLTYyRm13Ri1oaVJlSDI1WnRHWnJkdURuekJTM3JlYXpZcmhhQmswNDdEZ0xpSnljSXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 20 year-old woman has revealed the subtle symptoms she ignored for more than a decade, which turned out to be signs of deadly brain &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c72e9cc0-323d-11f0-ab12-8bae9bd0855c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a viral &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-c7330990-323d-11f0-ab12-8bae9bd0855c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;

Researchers found that people with specific patterns of brain activity and white matter structure performed better in the game StarCraft II, especially when it came to resource-related tasks that require scanning a complex visual environment. The results suggest that efficient attentional processing and underlying neural traits can facilitate skill development in fast-paced gaming environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StarCraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires players to manage resources, control armies, and make decisions under time pressure. Unlike action games that rely heavily on reflexes, StarCraft II emphasizes strategic planning and rapid information processing. Because the game demands frequent shifts in visual attention and quick identification of important in-game elements, it offers a unique opportunity to study how cognitive functions like visual search operate in dynamic, realistic settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While research on video games is well-established, only in recent years have we begun to systematically explore their potential benefits for cognitive functioning,” said study author Natalia Jakubowska, an assistant professor at SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities. “At the same time, esports has evolved into a serious discipline, where discussions about individual predispositions—much like in traditional sports—are increasingly common. We became curious whether there might be neurobiological traits that support effective learning or high-level performance in complex games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a more personal level, video games have always been part of my life—I grew up with them, and over time began to look at them through a research lens as well. During my student years, I somehow managed to spend over 1,200 hours playing The Witcher 3. These days I rarely dive into RPGs, but they definitely hold a special (and slightly nostalgic) place in my heart. Being able to combine my scientific interests with a long-standing personal fascination felt like a natural and rewarding direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakubowska and her colleagues designed their study to investigate how attention-related brain activity and brain structure predict success in StarCraft II. They were particularly interested in a brain signal called the N2pc, an electrical pattern measured using electroencephalography (EEG) that reflects how attention is allocated in space. In addition to EEG, participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the integrity of white matter pathways in the brain, which are essential for communication between different brain regions. The team wanted to know whether these neural markers, recorded before any gameplay training, could predict how well participants would perform in the game over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 21 non-gamers who received 30 hours of supervised StarCraft II training. Before the training began, all participants completed a visual search task while their brain activity was recorded. This task involved identifying a target shape among distracting shapes—sometimes in an easy “pop-out” condition, and other times in a harder “inefficient” search condition. The N2pc component was extracted from EEG data during these tasks. In parallel, participants underwent diffusion MRI scans to assess white matter integrity in key brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 30 hours of StarCraft II training, detailed in-game telemetry was collected. This included behavioral metrics like resource collection rates, unit production, strategic decision timing, and camera movement. The researchers used statistical modeling to condense these numerous metrics into three main gameplay factors: a “Proficiency Factor” related to strategic skill and unit management, a “Resource Factor” reflecting efficiency in acquiring and using in-game resources, and an “Efficiency Factor” linked to timing and multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed several significant relationships between pre-training brain data and later in-game performance. Participants who showed lower N2pc amplitudes during the inefficient visual search condition performed better on resource-related tasks in StarCraft II. This suggests that those who needed less neural effort to carry out a difficult search task were better equipped to manage resource-gathering strategies in the game. In other words, efficient neural processing of visual information seemed to translate into better gameplay in a visually demanding environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, white matter integrity in two specific brain areas—the right anterior limb of the internal capsule and the left external capsule—was positively associated with the same resource-related gameplay factor. These brain regions are known to connect frontal areas involved in decision-making with subcortical structures that support learning and attention. Higher fractional anisotropy, a measure of white matter coherence, in these regions was linked to both lower N2pc amplitudes and better in-game performance. This suggests a broader interaction between stable brain structure and dynamic attentional processes in shaping how players develop expertise in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by how clearly individual differences emerged even at the pre-training stage—and how well they predicted later in-game performance,” Jakubowska told PsyPost. “This suggests that some people may have neurobiological predispositions for developing specific skills in environments that demand rapid visual information processing—and that these traits can be detected even before any formal training takes place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, we were genuinely thrilled that our integrative approach worked so well. This was our first study combining functional (EEG), structural (MRI), and behavioral (telemetry-based game data) perspectives, and despite its methodological complexity, our model held up. We’re especially excited because very few studies to date have managed to integrate all three levels of analysis—particularly using real in-game telemetry rather than artificial lab tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the N2pc amplitude during the easier “pop-out” condition showed a possible relationship with overall strategic proficiency, though this link was weaker. The researchers suggest that the ability to detect salient visual information rapidly might help players with early-stage strategy planning, but more advanced strategic behavior likely draws on a broader set of cognitive skills beyond visual attention alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights that these functional and structural brain measures were not related to each other, but independently contributed to performance. This supports the idea that efficient visual search relies on both moment-to-moment attentional control and long-term neural architecture. The anterior limb of the internal capsule, in particular, connects brain areas involved in planning, learning, and attentional control. Its role in visual search and skill acquisition is consistent with past research showing its importance for cognitive speed and strategy execution. The external capsule, though less understood, also links various brain regions involved in perception and memory, which may aid in complex environmental scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that individuals who are more efficient at processing visual information—for example, locating relevant targets quickly amidst distractions—may have a natural advantage when it comes to performing well in complex strategy games like StarCraft II,” Jakubowska explained. “Interestingly, these differences are reflected not only in behavior, but also in brain activity and white matter structure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that success in video games—at least those that rely heavily on attention and planning—is not solely a matter of practice or habit. It may also relate to individual cognitive and neurobiological traits. More broadly, our findings support the idea that video games can serve as valuable tools for studying human attention and learning in dynamic, real-world-like environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, it’s important to remember that performance in games is rarely driven by a single cognitive skill,” Jakubowska continued. “Much depends on the strategy a player adopts, as well as on the specific nature and demands of the game. In our research, we focused on one specific mechanism—selective visual attention—but our findings clearly point to how much remains to be explored. Games like StarCraft II provide a cognitively rich environment that deserves further investigation from multiple angles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And this is just one game—we should keep in mind that the diversity of genres and mechanics in the world of video games offers an even broader landscape for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the authors note several limitations. The study had a relatively small sample size, which means it may not have had enough statistical power to detect smaller effects or allow detailed subgroup comparisons. Participants were also limited to non-gamers, so it remains to be seen whether the same neural patterns would predict performance in experienced players or professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We specifically recruited young adults (aged 18–35) with minimal experience in video games and no prior exposure to RTS, FPS, or TPS titles,” Jakubowska explained. “This made recruitment particularly challenging, but allowed us to control for prior gaming-related cognitive adaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also important to emphasize that this is a preliminary study—we are not yet measuring the effects of training itself, but rather identifying potential predictors of in-game success. Moreover, we focused on a single cognitive mechanism—selective visual attention—and examined it within the context of one game with specific demands. This represents a narrow, but promising, slice of a much broader landscape that warrants further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite these limitations, our findings clearly show that this kind of integrated approach—combining functional, structural, and behavioral data—holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of attention and learning in complex human–computer interaction environments,” Jakubowska said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As interest grows in the potential of video games for cognitive training, this research lays the groundwork for future investigations. Whether the goal is to enhance attention, design better training programs, or understand how the brain supports learning in dynamic settings, real-time strategy games like StarCraft II may continue to offer a powerful and flexible research tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our main long-term goal is to expand this line of research by examining other cognitive functions,” Jakubowska said. “In this study, we focused on selective visual attention, but complex video games engage a much broader range of processes—such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and decision-making. We are interested in exploring whether and how these functions are reflected in brain structure, brain activity, and game performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another key direction is longitudinal research. We now have data from four time points: before training, and after 10, 30, and 60 hours of gameplay. This gives us a rare opportunity to track how cognitive and neural indicators evolve over time in response to structured, high-intensity training. We’re particularly interested in whether early predispositions remain stable, diminish, or are eventually “caught up” by less initially advantaged participants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Equally important is the training environment itself,” Jakubowska continued. “Many cognitive studies rely on overly simplified or repetitive tasks that only superficially resemble real gaming. We aimed to strike a balance between experimental control and ecological validity. Our participants trained in a structured environment where we controlled for difficulty, scenario complexity, and—at later stages—enabled multiplayer interactions. This allowed us to construct two types of training conditions: more “lab-like” and more similar to real-world gaming. I strongly believe that even a highly capable individual may fail to develop cognitively in an inadequate environment—one that is too easy, monotonous, or unengaging. That may help explain why previous findings on the cognitive impact of gaming have been so mixed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the future, I would also love to conduct a comparative study involving professional players. I’m curious whether the differences we observe are purely quantitative—driven by training time and intensity—or whether elite gamers function differently on a qualitative level, both cognitively and neurologically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to the entire research team,” Jakubowska added. “Collecting data from a single participant—four behavioral assessments, four EEG sessions, four MRI scans, and 60 hours of in-lab training—required an enormous amount of coordinated effort. We estimate that each participant accounted for at least 100–120 hours of work, often involving multiple researchers at the same time. This really highlights the scale and dedication needed for studies of this kind, and I am incredibly grateful to everyone who contributed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project also reminded us that while integrated studies—combining neural, behavioral, and environmental data—are deeply fascinating and full of scientific promise, they are also extremely difficult to carry out. The reward of meaningful, high-quality data is often delayed by months or even years of hard work—not to mention the challenges of recruitment, training adherence, and logistical complexity across multiple measurement points.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lastly, I’d like to share a personal belief: I think games, while not always and not all equally, can be a valuable part of our lives,” Jakubowska concluded. “I don’t believe they are harmful in moderation—quite the opposite. Today’s games are not only entertainment tools; they are also complex learning environments, spaces for decision-making, social interaction, and even cultural expression. I believe it’s time we approached them with more openness—including from a scientific perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2025.108689" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brainwaves on battlegrounds: Preliminary insights into EEG, white matter microstructure, and StarCraft II performance&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Weronika Nieciecka, Paulina Lewandowska, Stanisław Adamczyk, Alicja Anna Binkowska, Aneta Brzezicka, Patryk Szczeciński, and Natalia Jakubowska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOa1lNOHpFY1JyMmhoOERQc2w4VkV5b2NZV05pM3MyTzFmWC1FYUtUS0l2NVoxTVZNRURiVDdXQlNUZFBGcnZwa3pqSnVwQlJJNWgtdTVaQWRVelgxZ1RWdWNOa0NUQTNNVVVTSU02UUJUbk1wUktyMjJPRVFaUVdHQmVLd1N4TndxWG9ERlhRRTZVR3kzTmhfaWJINWhhWHdPLXFhcV8zYmFPUnFyTXdGLWI3SFp0WDVWZGZUS0dGREdCdXc</guid></item><item><title>O.C.D.看起来可能与您想象的不同-《纽约时报》 | O.C.D.

Some patients obsess over thoughts that they might hurt someone, while others fixate on certain aspects of their personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The comedian Maria Bamford, for example, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/magazine/the-weird-scary-and-ingenious-brain-of-maria-bamford.html" title=""&gt;called her O.C.D.&lt;/a&gt; “unwanted thoughts syndrome.” On “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” she shared a story about how she couldn’t stop thinking horrific thoughts about her family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On social media, people describe many types of obsessions and compulsions: “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kayleebullen/video/7391176157401517355?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;relationship O.C.D.&lt;/a&gt;,” “sexual orientation O.C.D.” or “emotional contamination O.C.D.” These aren’t separate diagnoses, but rather they are different expressions of the same disorder — much like how people with phobias can suffer from different fears, said Dr. Carolyn Rodriguez, an O.C.D. expert and a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Understanding these distinctions can help clinicians tailor a precise treatment plan, she added.

But half of all babies with the disorder die in the first week of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia offered the Muldoons comfort care for their baby, a chance to forgo aggressive treatments in the face of a grim prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We loved him, and we didn’t want him to be suffering,” Ms. Muldoon said.

			&lt;p&gt;A US infant with a rare condition has become history's first patient to be treated with a personalized gene-editing technique that raises hopes for other people with obscure illnesses, doctors said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wee pioneer is KJ Muldoon, now a 9-and-a-half-month-old boy with chubby cheeks and big blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is caused by a mutation in a gene that produces an enzyme key to liver function, and prevents people with it from eliminating certain kinds of toxic waste produced by their metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You Google 'CPS1 deficiency' and it's either fatality rate or liver transplant," the baby's mother, Nicole Muldoon, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQWWLErLaY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; in a video released by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the baby was treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUQWWLErLaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the prognosis grim, doctors suggested something that had never been done before: a personalized treatment to fix the baby's genome using what amounts to a pair of molecular scissors – the technique called Crispr-Cas9, which earned its creators the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy's father said he and his wife faced an impossible decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our child is sick. We either have to get a liver transplant or give him this medicine that's never been given to anybody before, right?" said Kyle Muldoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161736" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-642x385.jpg" alt="A tiny newborn baby" class="size-medium wp-image-161736" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-642x385.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-692x415.jpg 692w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161736" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;KJ was only days old when he was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder and transferred to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where doctors were actively researching new cell and gene therapies.

&lt;p&gt;"The drug is really designed only for KJ, so the genetic variants that he has are specific to him. It's personalized medicine," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a member of the medical team who specializes in pediatric genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161743" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-642x428.jpg" alt="World's First Patient Treated With Personalized CRISPR Gene-Editing Therapy" class="size-medium wp-image-161743" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161743" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Patient KJ with Drs.

&lt;p&gt;The results were promising for other people with genetic conditions, said the medical team, which published their study Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ can now follow a diet richer in proteins – his condition prohibited such before – and does not need as much medicine as he used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161732" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161732" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily.jpg" alt="KJ's parents, Kyle and Nicole, and his three siblings" class="size-full wp-image-161732" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161732" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;KJ's parents, Kyle and Nicole, and his three siblings are looking forward to welcoming him home after a first-of-its-kind personalized gene editing therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Ahrens-Nicklas said she hoped this achievement will allow the boy to get by with little or no medication some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient's needs," the doctor&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This micro-activity can break prolonged sitting and improve metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study Biotech &amp;amp; Health Tech Abroad: Top Courses at Harvard, Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher found that people who sat for 8 continuous hours had a drastic spike in their post-meal blood glucose and insulin levels. However, when this pattern was interrupted with just two minutes of light or moderate walking, every 20 to 30 minutes, their blood sugar levels dropped by 24-30% and insulin levels by 23-26% compared to prolonged sitting. These benefits occurred regardless of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/doctor-explains-what-happens-if-one-walks-for-1-minute-to-what-happens-when-one-walks-for-60-minutes/articleshow/121078389.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means even a leisurely stroll can make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear. Sitting for long periods reduces muscle contractions and impairs glucose uptake, which leads to elevated blood sugar, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Regular movement reactivates these processes and helps the body to clear glucose and fats from the bloodstream more effectively. The study’s findings held true across body weight, sex, and baseline fitness levels. What makes the 2 per 20 rule so effective is its focus on movement frequency rather than intensity or calorie burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a desk job, or a sedentary lifestyle, try the 2 per 20 sitting-walking rule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for every 20 to 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get up from your seat, refill your water bottle, or take a stroll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure to walk for at least 2 to 3 minutes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you are on the phone, walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can use a smartwatch or step counter to track your movement &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxOMlRObmpRaG42NmtkOERURlVhM0g4ZDhEN2lzbllEUzBYRmpDV0JwbGRCR3Vvb1hya2t4UDV0VV9XbXNmclc0QWFtWGdseWxWM2pndnJUbjhvV1VvQkFPUks0anR4QVdMNzUzc3psX285aWZBd05PV0hOU2JIQTMtOXNaSC1lUnBiRTNnaFRCYjBfRXhqMXd4cEZXZHI4bFVrbWVIdFZzWVp2ZFNiRFdmTmxNSkpjUE84a2MwVnAwSVVwMVd2Z3ZQZTFMUVV2aU1HMFEtemVrbEJOS0FQcTJBcExFdVJDU29xazN4VzIzUXZFOWtPeEh3azhVSU5Ma2lLR2Y1Sl81c0wtTTJhd1BqRnotZWI</guid></item><item><title>Trading Standards - BBC发布的鼻鞣喷雾警告 | Nasal tanning sprays warning issued by Trading Standards - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE4zV3VZWU1zUEszTWFuRkEyTWxUWUZ0QXdwYjd1RDR0MXZYa0dROGpQZktIODJzQ0dta2xzdi1VblNrd1BWVU1kX2ZKY3oxUWpSaHBPdzd5Ulg3Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE01YmdfaXgtdkk4RHFpMG42VzRRbFR2LVJ6VVF0T1pPV0VyWURJMlVWSnNBcFJLNlFIeGotVTdmZXkxazlnUnJmTkxiYTUya19NVmFWZEg3VUc0VWdEcXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Warning over 'unlicensed' nasal tanning sprays&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;William Higgens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Investigations, North West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Small bottles of nasal tanners.

Those who do may get a flu-like illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A small number of people infected with polio - between one in a thousand and one in a hundred - develop more serious problems that can lead to paralysis. This is also when the disease becomes life-threatening, particularly when paralysis affects muscles used for breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Papua New Guinea was said to be polio-free since 2000, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44614382" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;until an outbreak in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was contained within the same year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The latest cases were found to be carrying a virus strain genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia. Papua New Guinea shares a border with Indonesia's easternmost Papua province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Minister Elias Kapavore has vowed to achieve 100% polio immunisation in the country by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is no excuse... Polio is a serious disease," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The ongoing campaign will target children aged 10 and below and is expected to reach around 3.5 million people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The battle on polio starts today," the department wrote in a Facebook post yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The WHO, UN's children agency Unicef and Australia's government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its rollout of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Unicef's Papua New Guinea representative Veera Mendonca pointed out the disparity in vaccination coverage across the country - with coverage as low as 8% in some districts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is not acceptable," she said, adding that Unicef is working with churches and community leaders to encourage vaccination and to dispel any misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Polio has staged a comeback elsewhere in Asia in recent years.

			&lt;p&gt;We're all aware of the psychological pain of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-world-s-loneliest-gannet-has-died-by-the-side-of-his-only-love"&gt;a broken heart&lt;/a&gt; – countless books, songs, and movies have been written and made on the topic – but there's also scientific evidence that a broken heart can be fatal too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical term is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt; (TC), a weakening of the heart brought on by physical or emotional stress. A new study from researchers at the University of Arizona looked at data on 199,890 patients in the US between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incidence of TC rose slightly over the study period for both males and females, but overall incidence was generally higher for females. Fatalities and complications caused by the condition were relatively high&lt;/span&gt;. This fits in with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2015.10.022"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting this 'broken heart syndrome' is becoming more common in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the condition was more common in women, deaths were more than twice as likely in men, with 11.2 percent of males dying compared with 5.5 percent of females. The overall death rate was 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that the death rate from takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; interventional cardiologist M. Reza Movahed, from the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have put forward a hypothesis for the gap between men and women. TC is believed to be brought on by a surge of stress hormones, triggered by either physical or emotional stress – so a physical stress might be surgery or an infection, whereas emotional stress could be a divorce or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg" alt="Broken heart mortality rates" class="wp-image-161618 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mortality rates stayed high, but were higher for men. (Movahed et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical stress TC &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.11.027"&gt;is more common&lt;/a&gt; in men, which may explain the higher numbers of deaths brought on by the condition. The researchers also think differences in hormone balances between the sexes could play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications resulting from TC included congestive heart failure (35.9 percent of patients), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; (20.7 percent), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"&gt;cardiogenic shock&lt;/a&gt; (6.6 percent), stroke (5.3 percent) and cardiac arrest (3.4 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is often marked down as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or chest pain, because of the similarity of the symptoms. But the researchers behind the new study are hoping to raise awareness of the condition, so that it can be better diagnosed and treated more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is something that health professionals have known about for a while, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the condition – both in how it might be detected and how the risk of complications could be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every case of TC is caused by relationship breakups, but it's clear that losing someone we love &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yes-you-can-die-from-a-broken-heart-new-study-shows-how-damaging-losing-a-loved-one-really-is"&gt;has multiple consequences&lt;/a&gt; for our physical and mental health, and that the heart can sometimes take the brunt of the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, few things have inspired &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/online-wellness-content-3-ways-to-tell-evidence-based-health-information-from-pseudoscience-224119"&gt;as much quackery&lt;/a&gt; as the pills, potions and promises to slow ageing, boost vitality, or extend life. Yet, amid the hype and hollow claims, a few golden truths remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far back as 400 BC, Hippocrates, widely considered the father of modern medicine, famously said, "Walking is man's best medicine." More than two millennia later, science is finally catching up with that wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who walk more than 8,000 steps a day &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30211-4/fulltext"&gt;reduce their risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt; by half, compared to those who walk fewer than 5,000 steps – the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. But beyond 8,000 steps, the benefits tend to plateau, which challenges the long-held belief in the magic of 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that benchmark wasn't born of science, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/counting-every-step-you-take"&gt;but of marketing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42864061"&gt;10,000-step goal&lt;/a&gt; originated from a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q598"&gt;1960s Japanese advertising campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the world's first commercial pedometer called the &lt;em&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/em&gt;, which literally translates to "10,000 steps meter".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, researchers have been exploring a simple but important question: does every step count the same, or can walking faster – at a brisk pace of more than 100 steps a minute, or around three to four miles per hour – actually give you more health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ageing and heart health there is mounting evidence that pace really matters. Simply converting a 14-minute daily stroll into a seven-minute brisk walk has been associated with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae506"&gt;14% reduction in heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of more than 450,000 adults in the UK used a genetic marker of biological age to reveal that by middle age, a lifetime of brisk walking reduces biological age by up to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03323-x"&gt;16 years&lt;/a&gt; compared to a lifetime of slow walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study suggested it is never too late to benefit from brisk walking. An inactive 60-year woman or man was modelled to gain around an additional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2024.100970"&gt;year of life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; through simply introducing a ten minute brisk walk into their daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of brisk walking can also be seen in its ability to predict future health outcomes. It has been shown to be a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319887281"&gt;stronger predictor&lt;/a&gt; of the risk of dying from heart disease than traditional predictors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, while also being a more powerful predictor than many other measures of lifestyle – including diet, obesity levels, and total physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, perhaps the single most informative question a doctor could ask their patient is: "How fast is your walking pace in comparison to other people?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Halo of benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But brisk walking may not provide additional benefits for all outcomes or in all contexts. For example, the benefit of brisk walking over light-intensity walking in lowering  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggested that although total walking was associated with reduction in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109360"&gt;13 different types of cancers&lt;/a&gt;, there was no added value from brisk walking. Breaking prolonged sitting with light-intensity pottering around has also been shown to have profound impacts on metabolic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, walking has a halo of benefits beyond physical health. It can help with brain activity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036577"&gt;doubling creative idea production&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the systems in the brain that support memory and imagination are also the same as those activated during whole body movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us already harness this very phenomenon, using walking to mull over problems and arrive at solutions or insights that would otherwise remain elusive. Context is also important here, with the mental health and cognitive benefits of walking thought to be enhanced when walking through nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So called "nature prescriptions" for clinical populations have harnessed these principles to increase walking activity and improving both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h29z-l3XTlk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity is a major driver of the modern  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; of long-term conditions, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease, that are now observed in industrialised and developing economies alike. It has been estimated that 3.9 million premature deaths could be averted annually through targeting physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of prevention, medical systems are largely based on management – people get ill and are then prescribed medicines to treat the illness. On average it takes $1 billion to bring a new drug to market which, despite these research and development costs, still go on to generate sizeable profits for shareholders showing the scale of the health economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If just a fraction of these costs were diverted into public health initiatives aimed at increasing walking and physical activity opportunities for all, the need for an ever more sophisticated medical management ecosphere may retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, when searching for the elixir of life, you could do worse than looking down at your feet.&lt;em&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255655/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/thomas-e-yates-2383889"&gt;Thomas E.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Multnomah County public health officials have confirmed one case of tuberculosis at Southeast Portland's Lane Middle School. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person had been recently diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis but may have been contagious between Sept. 3, 2024, and May 1, 2025, exposing others, officials said. Those who have been potentially exposed have been contacted by the Multnomah County Health Department via an emailed letter. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County officials added that there is little risk to the general public at this time and they are not aware of any cases connected to the infectious person. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland Public Schools said that the Lane Middle School community can join a &lt;a href="http://meet.google.com/xsi-nntk-hqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;virtual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, also being held in-person at the middle school, at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, May 20, for more information about testing, as well as potential testing locations and times.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with &lt;a href="https://multco.us/news/faq-tuberculosis-exposure-and-steps-take" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;questions &lt;/a&gt;can call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406; the department will also be providing free blood tests to the school community in the coming weeks. Those doing a TB test with a personal health care provider should call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, most people who have had casual contact with a person diagnosed with tuberculosis will not become infected,” said Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno in a statement Thursday. “And most people who become infected will never become ill with tuberculosis, especially with current medication regimens. While tuberculosis can be spread in school settings, we expect that anyone infected would not yet be ill and could be effectively treated with medication.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county said it works with up to 30 tuberculous cases a year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tuberculous&lt;/a&gt;, a bacteria that spreads through close face-to-face contact for several hours or daily contact through weeks or months, is curable with medication, but the infection progresses slowly, so it is important to be treated in order to prevent serious illness. Tuberculous is not spread by sharing clothing, dishes or drinking glasses, and it does not live on surfaces and is not spread through contact like shaking hands. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include coughing, chest pain and coughing up blood or phlegm; people with inactive TB do not have symptoms and cannot spread it to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Jason Speakman/MH Illustration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I decided I would try making overnight oats as a healthier breakfast option than sugary drinkable yogurt. I found the oats aisle and just stood there, attempting to make sense of the four dozen options in front of me, in every form, flavor, and level of added sugar. They all looked equally “processed” to me. I gave up, leaving the store without oats and with a heavy load of emotional exhaustion. And that’s just the oatmeal section of the grocery store, never mind the stacks of snacks, drinks, and condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new supermarket anxiety plaguing Americans who want to eat healthier but aren’t quite sure how. By now, you’re likely aware of the overwhelming, still growing evidence of the health risks of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which links their overconsumption to a greater chance of premature death, as well as to plenty of its contributors: cognitive decline, dementia, depression and anxiety, several types of cancer, heart disease, inflammation, insulin resistance, and gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Yeah, rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s wild is that UPFs are a huge part of what we eat. The average American’s diet consists of about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001253" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:57 percent UPFs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;57 percent UPFs&lt;/a&gt;; that jumps to about two-thirds for children and teens. Maybe that’s not surprising when you consider that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-37457-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.menshealth.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64761295%2Fultra-processed-foods-why-they-are-bad%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 73 percent of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;up to 73 percent of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study by a Harvard and Northeastern University research group led by Giulia Menichetti, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menichetti’s scientists are doing more than just counting UPFs. They and other researchers are also trying to make grocery store choices easier by tackling the surprisingly difficult task of figuring out exactly which UPFs are hurting us most and why. And they’re aiming to add nuance to the narrative that any UPF is bad for you. “Large population studies have begun to show that what is currently categorized as ultra-processed food may not be equally bad for our health,” Menichetti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where the Dangers of UPFs Are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what makes one package of anything better than another means decoding why UPFs are linked to so many major health problems. Researchers don’t quite know yet. In fact, there’s not even a clear, specific definition of “ultra-processed” that all scientists agree on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re not talking about is stuff like olive oil and frozen strawberries. Yes, these foods are processed, but oil pressing and flash freezing are considered minimal forms of processing, not ultra-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition used by many researchers comes from the Nova classification system, developed by a team led by Brazilian scientist Carlos Monteiro, MD, PhD. Nova divides foods into four groups, from unprocessed or minimally processed to UPFs, which are foods made entirely or mostly from substances extracted from whole foods or synthesized in a laboratory. According to this system, UPFs are designed to be “hyper-palatable and attractive, with a long shelf-life.” Per one of Dr. Monteiro’s studies, they also tend to be “energy-dense, high in unhealthy types of fat, refined starches, free sugars and salt, and poor sources of protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients.” So that would include cookies, sweet yogurts, energy drinks, instant soups, and food “nuggets.” Some critics say Nova puts too much weight on the number of ingredients in a product and the number of processes it goes through. Under its terms, some healthful homemade foods would be considered processed, such as hummus made from canned beans or made-from-scratch bread. Still, Nova is often used in studying exactly why UPFs do a number on your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How UPFs Affect Us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no shortage of really interesting and compelling-sounding theories about how ultra-processed food might impact human health,” says Kevin Hall, PhD, who’s doing dietary intervention studies on UPFs at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effect is straightforward: “They make people eat more,” says Marion Nestle, PhD, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University. Hall saw this in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946062/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:groundbreaking 2019 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;groundbreaking 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; in which 20 people spent two weeks eating a diet of 81 percent UPFs. They then spent another two weeks eating a diet with the same amount of protein, fat, and carbs but from non-UPF foods. On both diets, they could eat as little or as much as they wanted. Given that the nutrient distribution was the same, Hall didn’t expect to see a big difference—but he proved himself wrong. On the UPF diet, people ate about 500 more calories a day and, unsurprisingly, gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s obvious that people overeat UPFs because their fat, sugar, and sodium content makes them taste really good. Those extra calories can lead to obesity, which contributes to most of the health issues linked to UPFs, Nestle says. But other researchers think that answer is too simplistic and suggest it may be that the body absorbs UPFs so quickly that they don’t make us feel full. Or that these foods lack the fiber your microbiome needs to help manage your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that processing itself can change a food in unexpected ways. Anthony Fardet, PhD, a food scientist at France’s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, cites a theory that xenobiotics, or synthetic chemicals, might be damaging. These could be lab-made additives, or even compounds leached from packaging into the food itself. Either way, xenobiotics don’t exist in nature, he says, and we don’t know how they affect our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emulsifiers are coming under scrutiny as well. These are substances designed to stabilize UPFs by holding together two liquids, usually oil and water. Emerging research in top journals such as Gastroenterology indicates that some of these, such as polysorbate-80 (used in foods like ice cream) and the texture modifier carboxymethylcellulose (which could be in anything from sausages to baked goods to candy), can lead to inflammation in the gut. This could prevent adequate nutrient absorption and damage your metabolism. Other emulsifiers may be harmless; some may combine to cause trouble. So, it’s complicated. “The idea is to start looking at foods not only by considering one chemical at a time, one nutrient at a time, but by looking at how these different chemicals influence each other and how the overall profile of chemicals determines the quality of food,” Menichetti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know this is a lot. And so do the scientists, who are only in the early stages of unpacking what makes UPFs so damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are you supposed to do while researchers figure it out? Tech tools might help a bit (see below). But when you’ve got to go packaged, at least aim to offset the effects we know about so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Pick the products that are lowest in added sugar—since added sugars are often a big sign of a less-healthy UPF. Same with sugar alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Find ways to add omega-3s to your diet. A high-UPF diet generally doesn’t include much of these. Try having a meal with salmon or tuna each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Load up on fiber, since a high-UPF diet can leave you lacking here. Make an effort: Your goal should be 30 to 38 grams a day, ideally from a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Determine whether some of the foods you consume are actually increasing your hunger or your desire to eat. Consider tracking what you eat for a week. Do you notice that you eat more on certain days with certain types of foods? If you can identify which are more addictive for you, focus on alternatives to those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menichetti and her team want to make all of this easier by diving into the thicket of details so you don’t have to—so they’ve started a database, TrueFood, to help. And they’re also wishing that the food industry had better labeling and, ideally, better foods. Nestle echoes that, saying that better regulations could force the food industry to make healthier products. People trying to eat better are “fighting the entire food system on their own,” she says. “That’s really hard to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Eventually, when I’m in the oats aisle, I’ll have great tools to help me. In the meantime, I’ll use the strategies on the left and try to choose as many foods as I can that look as close as possible to, well, food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;True Food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Photo credit: True Food&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.truefood.tech/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; analyzes a product’s ingredients and spits out a score from 0 to 100, indicating how highly processed that food is likely to be.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that moderate amounts of zinc can help slow down aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found that adding exercise may enhance the effects of zinc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s worth noting that too much zinc can increase the speed of aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us are continually looking for ways to slow down or reverse aging, and one thing that makes us age more quickly is inflammation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-linked-with-lower-risk-of-cognitive-impairment-8641170" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on research that suggests that an anti-inflammatory diet may reduce the risk of cognitive impairment—brain aging—by 21%. And another study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-aging-study-11731249" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating more antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;—which are anti-inflammatory—may help you live longer with a higher quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of these anti-inflammatory nutrients is zinc, an essential trace mineral that you must get from food or supplements since the body does not make it on its own. While you don’t need a lot of zinc each day, this antioxidant-acting mineral plays an important role in supporting DNA, wound healing and immunity—all things that influence aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists have jumped on the anti-aging bandwagon, not just to prevent it, but to measure it. Tools that use algorithms to determine people’s biological age are now available and often used in studies. Biological age is defined as the chronological age-dependent decline of biological functions, characterized by 12 biomarkers that fall under three categories that can be measured with bloodwork. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, while chronological age is how old you are in years from birth to now, biological age is the speed at which your body is aging. For example, a 48-year-old woman’s biological aging may be keeping pace with her chronological age—or it could be aging more slowly or faster than an average 48-year-old woman. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from China wanted to know more about the role of zinc in biological aging, plus how exercise might modify zinc’s effect on aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break them down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data was pulled from the UK Biobank, a long-term study that contains medical and lifestyle information on over 500,000 UK residents. For this current study, researchers drew data on almost 69,000 people who met their criteria, which included having sufficient information on diet, physical activity and biomarkers to calculate biological age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were divided into two groups: one group without zinc intake and one with it. The group without zinc included over 35,000 people with an average age of 56; 46% were female. The zinc group included over 33,000 people with an average age of 56; about 65% were female.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zinc intake was calculated based on participants’ food records and responses to questions about supplements. Participants’ zinc intake amounts were compared against the daily recommended intake of 11 mg per day for male participants and at least 8 mg per day for female participants, with neither going over 40 mg per day. Over 40 mg/day is considered zinc overdose for both males and females.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The exercise amount was calculated based on standard questionnaires regarding physical activity and was transposed into metabolic equivalent of task (MET). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 600 MET per week, which is equivalent to at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week or 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Biological aging was calculated using the ENABL Age tool, which, according to these researchers, is the most up-to-date estimation tool for distinguishing healthy aging from unhealthy aging, and for predicting mortality for 5- and 10-year mortality markers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Confounding factors that affect biological aging and would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included sex, ethnicity group, BMI, family income, sleep disorders, smoking status, alcohol intake and history of cancer diagnosis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study suggests that participants with delayed biological aging—meaning they’re aging more slowly—tend to have higher levels of daily zinc intake compared to participants with accelerated aging. Specifically, those who got the recommended amount of zinc each day showed an average delay of 0.11 years in biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, as with most things, more is not necessarily better, as those with zinc intakes over the recommended limit of 40 mg/day showed an acceleration of almost 7 years in biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis that included exercise suggests that participants with the recommended dose of zinc intake plus the recommended amount of physical activity had 31% decreased odds of having biological aging acceleration compared to participants with inadequate zinc intake and inadequate physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some limitations of this study include the narrow population, since the UK Biobank is mostly made up of white people of European descent. The nature of this observational study cannot conclude causation; in other words, researchers cannot say that zinc causes slower aging, just that it’s associated with it. Also, diet and physical activity information was self-reported, which always leaves room for error and bias.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-relate-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Relate to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, insufficient zinc intake affects approximately 17% of people around the globe, and for this reason, they state that zinc supplements may be useful for some. However, this also comes with caution, as too much zinc speeds up aging—by a lot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers aren’t exactly sure why zinc seems to slow aging, but they know that zinc influences age-related processes, including DNA synthesis, protein metabolism, cell proliferation (generating new cells) and mitosis (cell replication). Zinc has also been linked with bone health, immunity support, healthy hormones and the prevention of nervous system diseases, like Alzheimer’s. It also acts like an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, researchers add. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-inflammation-ages-you-8744048" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less inflammation means slower aging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat your zinc, aim for sources like seafood, meat, poultry, dairy, nuts and seeds. Both our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-8777942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;30-Day High-Protein Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-11711460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;30-Day Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; contain plenty of healthy-aging foods, including those high in zinc. If you need more guidance to ensure you’re eating for healthy aging, make an appointment with a registered dietitian to help you design a plan based on your needs, lifestyle and preferences. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also included the role of physical activity, noting that when combined with sufficient zinc intake, aging was slowed even further. The study didn’t differentiate between types of exercise—like cardio versus strength training—just that participants were meeting minimal guidelines. If you’re currently not physically active, just start moving more throughout the day and be intentional about it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, do more trips into the house from the car with groceries, or up and down the stairs when putting laundry away. Take frequent breaks throughout the day to stretch, do a set of squats or walk a lap around the house. Over time, gradually increase the amount until you’re more closely meeting the minimum recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study suggests that adequate zinc intake can slow biological aging, even more so when combined with exercise. But researchers also found that too much zinc was associated with much faster biological aging. Consider assessing which foods you’re currently eating that provide zinc. If you think you’re not getting enough, choose which foods to add. But before supplementing with zinc, meet with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure you don’t get more of it than your body needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t go breaking my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a loved one passes on and your heart aches — there’s a name for that, and apparently, men are more likely to die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical term for “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/laughter-can-heal-a-broken-heart-literally-cardiac-health-study/"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; syndrome” is takotsubo cardiomyopathy — and people are diagnosed with it when stress hormones like adrenaline prevent their hearts from properly contracting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a serious condition brought on by very stressful situations and extreme emotions that doctors don’t take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While women are known to more often suffer from the syndrome — men are the ones actually dying from it at more than twice the rate, according to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point the study made is that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/laughter-can-heal-a-broken-heart-literally-cardiac-health-study/"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; syndrome is “triggered by emotional stress, predominantly in women, or physical stress, predominantly in men.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, researchers observed almost 2,000 patients older than 18-years-old diagnosed with the condition from 2016 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that the mortality rate of brokenhearted men was a staggering 11.2% compared to only 5.5% of the female patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers reportedly concluded that those who died most likely suffered complications from the condition, like irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Men may be more at risk for dying and having bad outcomes because they’re less susceptible to begin with,” Dr. Ilan Wittstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/men-are-likely-die-broken-heart-syndrome-study-says-rcna206276" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that just because you’re feeling blue over something doesn’t necessarily mean you have the condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Wittstein, those with underlying health issues, especially relating to the heart — like high blood pressure or high cholesterol — are more susceptible to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, there isn’t any treatment or medication for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In certain situations, doctors will prescribe patients medicine used to treat other heart conditions, but that’s on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, experts advise people to seek medical attention if they’re feeling unusual chest pains or symptoms — and to manage stress levels, which can be challenging in this day and age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we advance in age and take on more life and work responsibilities, we experience higher stress levels,” Dr. Susan Cheng &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/10/13/broken-heart-syndrome-is-on-the-rise-especially-among-older-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And with increasing digitization around every aspect of our lives, environmental stressors have also intensified.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Aside from lowering stress levels, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/health/just-3-days-of-this-bad-habit-can-increase-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;getting sufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; is another way people can lower their risk of developing heart-related issues, according to another &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-05-08-lack-of-sleep-can-increase-the-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we have improved our understanding of what role the amount of sleep we get plays in cardiovascular health,” Cedernaes said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that studies have also shown that physical exercise can offset at least some of the negative effects that poor sleep can cause,” he added. “But it’s also important to note that exercise cannot replace the essential functions of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended for adults to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night — so there’s another reason why you should put away your phone to get a good night’s snooze. &lt;/p&gt;

Using fMRI data from over 1,500 healthy participants, researchers found that sensory input, regardless of the type, engages the midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas are crucial for regulating alertness, attention, and awareness. The surprising discovery highlights a shared subcortical network for sensory attention, deepening our understanding of how consciousness is organized in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Brain Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; All senses activated the same deep brain regions when participants paid close attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Activity in the midbrain and thalamus was strongest during tasks requiring sharp focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The results could lead to better treatments for ADHD and consciousness disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans perceive and navigate the world around us with the help of our five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while scientists have long known that these different senses activate different parts of the brain, a new Yale-led study indicates that multiple senses all stimulate a critical region deep in the brain that controls consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109996"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published May 15 in the journal &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, sheds new light on how sensory perception works in the brain and may fuel the development of therapies to treat disorders involving attention, arousal, and consciousness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, a research team led by Yale’s Aya Khalaf focused on the workings of subcortical arousal systems, brain structure networks that play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies on patients with disorders of consciousness — such as coma or epilepsy — have confirmed the influence of these systems on states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior research has been largely limited to tracking individual senses. For the new study, researchers asked if stimuli from multiple senses share the same subcortical arousal networks. They also looked at how shifts in a subject’s attention might affect these networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) datasets collected from 1,561 healthy adult participants as they performed 11 different tasks using four senses: vision, audition, taste, and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made two important discoveries: that sensory input &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make use of shared subcortical systems and, more surprisingly, that all input — regardless of which sense delivered the signal — stimulates activity in two deep brain regions, the midbrain reticular formation and the central thalamus, when a subject is sharply focused on the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were expecting to find activity on shared networks, but when we saw all the senses light up the same central brain regions while a test subject was focusing, it was really astonishing,” said Khalaf, a postdoctoral associate in neurology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery highlighted how key these central brain regions are in regulating not only disorders of consciousness, but also conditions that impact attention and focus, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could lead to better targeted medications and brain stimulation techniques for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has also given us insights into how things work normally in the brain,” said senior author Hal Blumenfeld, the Mark Loughridge and Michele Williams Professor of Neurology who is also a professor in neuroscience and neurosurgery and director of the Yale Clinical Neuroscience Imaging Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a step forward in our understanding of awareness and consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking across senses, this is the first time researchers have seen a result like this, said Khalaf, who is also part of Blumenfeld’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It tells us how important this brain region is and what it could mean in efforts to restore consciousness,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors include Erick Lopez, a former undergraduate researcher in Blumenfeld’s lab, and collaborators from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of

sensory modalities is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated shared subcortical arousal systems across sensory modalities during transient changes in attention using block and event-related fMRI paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed massive publicly available fMRI datasets collected while 1561 participants performed visual, auditory, tactile, and taste perception tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses revealed a shared circuit of subcortical arousal systems exhibiting early transient increases in activity in midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus across perceptual modalities, as well as less consistent increases in pons, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these networks is critical for understanding mechanisms of normal attention and consciousness and may help facilitate subcortical targeting for therapeutic neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Carriers of recessive gene mutations, long thought to be unaffected, may actually face subtle disadvantages, including more medical issues, shorter educational attainment, and reduced reproductive success. A study of over 300,000 individuals reveals that people who carry recessive genes for intellectual disability are especially impacted, despite having only one mutated gene copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These carriers were more likely to be childless and had shorter school careers, suggesting evolutionary selection pressures still act on these seemingly silent genes. The findings challenge textbook assumptions and offer new insights into how natural and sexual selection may still shape the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Carriers of recessive disease genes show more medical diagnoses and slightly lower reproductive success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Carriers of intellectual disability genes attend school for fewer years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced reproductive success may result from subtle effects that influence mate choice and social outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Radboud University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a group, carriers of recessive disorders are slightly less healthy and have a reduced chance of having offspring. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disadvantage is greatest for carriers of a recessive gene for intellectual disability, and reflected in a shorter school career and increased childlessness, according to research from Radboudumc published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to rewrite the textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominant mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Radboudumc, Department of Human Genetics, demonstrated something remarkable in a 2014 publication in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, inherited variants in genes were rarely responsible for intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority, the disability arose from a spontaneous mutation: a mutation that neither parent has, but suddenly appears in the child. It is a biological fact that about one hundred spontaneous mutations occur in the hereditary material of each child. Mutations that therefore do not originate from the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, only one of these one hundred mutations affects a gene. And only a fraction of those affects one of the hundreds of genes that can cause intellectual disability. But rare events still happen. Most intellectual disabilities arise in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From dominant to recessive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was something else going on,” said Christian Gilissen, professor of Genome Bioinformatics and first author of the 2014 article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children receive a gene from both father and mother by default. When a single mutation in the child leads to intellectual disability, this is called a mutation in a &lt;em&gt;dominant gene&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other mutations affect &lt;em&gt;recessive genes&lt;/em&gt;. Having a single mutation in a recessive gene, in principle, has no effect on the carrier. A handicap only arises if the mutation is in both copies of the recessive gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our clinic we found very few of these double mutations in recessive genes in children with intellectual disabilities. Strange, because there are more recessive than dominant genes for this. So we wondered: where did all those recessive mutations go?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More medical diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question led to a long and extensive search, the results of which have now been published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We first investigated how often these recessive mutations occur in the population,” says Han Brunner professor of clinical genetics and, like Gilissen, involved in both publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the data of more than 300,000 people included in the UK Biobank were examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that each person carries on average two mutations in any one of 1,900 recessive genes. According to textbooks, carriers of such recessive genes should not experience any disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we found that, as a group, they do have more medical diagnoses, and slightly less offspring. Thus, they are less likely to pass on their genes for recessive disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to other recessive genes, genes for intellectual disability were the most absent. Apparently, there is another aspect at play here. The UK Biobank data provide a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilissen: “Carriers of a recessive gene for intellectual disability go to school for a shorter time, which suggests that they have a lower level of education. Mind you, these are carriers, according to existing theory, are not affected at all by their recessive gene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More likely to be childless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, carriers of recessive genes for intellectual disability have reduced reproductive success and a shorter school career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brunner: “In 1859, Darwin published &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&lt;/em&gt;. It was mainly about survival, about genes that make you strong and healthy, about natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Twelve years later he wrote &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&lt;/em&gt;, in which he refined his theory. You can have fine genes, but if no one wants to have children with you, those genes will not be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The principle of sexual selection. We’re not demonstrating it rock solid here, but if I had to give a cause for these findings – based in part on a lot of sociological research – sexual selection is the most obvious explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewriting textbooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research clearly shows that recessive carriers of diseases have a selection disadvantage at the group level. In the past, this has been pointed out for specific disorders. Here, for the first time this is demonstrated for recessive disorders in general. That may go into the textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brunner: “Our research indicates that our genes are still constantly changing, that the genetic landscape remains in motion, that evolution continues. The idea that in our modern age evolution has come to a creaking halt thanks to health care and other amenities is not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor will it ever be, Gilissen suggests: “We will never be optimized for tomorrow’s problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this evolutionary neuroscience and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f0f161a0b1a0d511310121e110c3f0d1e1b1d100a1b0a121c511113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pieter Lomans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radboudumc.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Radboud University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Pieter Lomans – Radboud University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02204-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reproductive and cognitive phenotypes in carriers of recessive pathogenic variants&lt;/a&gt;” by Christian Gilissen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive and cognitive phenotypes in carriers of recessive pathogenic variants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic landscape of human Mendelian diseases is shaped by mutation and selection. Although selection on heterozygotes is well-established in autosomal-dominant disorders, convincing evidence for selection in carriers of pathogenic variants associated with recessive conditions is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we studied heterozygous pathogenic variants in 1,929 genes, which cause recessive diseases when bi-allelic, in &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 378,751 unrelated European individuals from the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find evidence suggesting fitness effects in heterozygous carriers for recessive genes, especially for variants in constrained genes across a broad range of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest reproductive effects at the population level, and hence natural selection, for autosomal-recessive disease variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, variants in genes that underlie intellectual disability are associated with lower educational attainment in carriers, and we observe an altered genetic landscape, characterized by a threefold reduction in the calculated frequency of bi-allelic intellectual disability in the population relative to other recessive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 21:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOdFJrdE9Sc0w1dlZVZTFwZTVGQlJYRW13ZVhUSk9UR093TWR5QmpDZlUyRFYtRU5MeDhPdkJ2eVQwN3ZDaVloZ0tFdFdjN0NUcDM1eUpTVmtZa3JSbWlXa19tdjEzZk5IaVg2TUx0TV9sc2FFSGFPS19ZaTlYZlhVaA</guid></item><item><title>沉默三天后，您的大脑化学物质会发生变化-男孩天才报告 | Your brain chemistry changes after just three days of silence - Boy Genius Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUHNsR1FxMWhvdU01U0VuQmpFNXRGQnJWOXZFbDZWNTZLMWVLUjktdVVORWhBNFhoZFVieXpQaFAtbDg2YlRrV1l4ZmlEV3VKS253c1lfSm8yNGpZUnhBSV96NmVPcFRDbHZzS3kzSDNmajJmVldpWVJNN0w0RUkxSjRlOEtUbXREWUlvTWlnQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content no-dropcap"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of silence as empty space. The absence of sound. But, it turns out that quiet isn’t passive at all. In fact, after just three days of intentional silence, the brain begins to physically and functionally rewire itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.98.2.676"&gt;growing body of neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4087081/"&gt;silence can spark changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt; comparable to months of meditation, cognitive training, or rigorous exercise. These changes don’t take long to show up, either. They begin after about 72 hours of cumulative quiet.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfixated.com/the-shocking-ways-your-brain-changes-after-just-3-days-of-silence/"&gt;most surprising discoveries&lt;/a&gt; centers on the hippocampus, the part of the brain that governs memory. Scientists found that after three days of sustained silence, participants showed measurable growth of new brain cells in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of neurogenesis was previously thought to require long-term interventions. But, for people regularly exposed to noise, the effect was even more dramatic, suggesting those most stressed by sound may benefit the most from the changes silence drives in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

People shift from fast, high-alert beta waves to slower alpha and theta waves associated with calm focus and creativity. By the third day, participants were reaching these states more quickly, within minutes instead of hours. These same patterns are typically linked to deep meditation or states of flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional benefits are just as striking. After a few days of silence, the brain’s emotional centers change to communicate more efficiently. People become better at noticing early signs of emotional stress and responding to them with more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in silent retreats reported steadier moods, fewer overreactions, and increased resilience. Remarkably, these effects lasted for weeks after the silent period ended. With the brain no longer busy processing constant sound, other senses grow sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People demonstrated better vision, taste, smell, and touch, confirmed by standardized testing. This sensory sharpening stems from the brain reallocating resources, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. It’s one reason silence may be especially helpful for those in high-performance sensory fields like culinary arts or design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance also improves. Working memory, the ability to hold and manage information in the moment, saw consistent gains. People recalled details more easily, solved problems faster, and made fewer mental errors after just a few days of silence. These advantages appeared across a wide range of individuals, from professionals to retirees, signifying major changes in the brain.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence may even help protect the brain over time. Long-term studies found that regular quiet periods could slow age-related decline and reduce stress-related damage to the brain. In clinical trials with older adults, structured silence improved memory, lowered anxiety, and delayed the progression of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to go on a remote retreat to experience these benefits. About two hours of accumulated quiet a day—spaced throughout mornings, breaks, and evenings—is enough to produce measurable effects, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the day without screens, taking a short walk without earbuds, or carving out ten minutes between tasks can all add up. We’re still working to understand how the brain changes, and we just found out&lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/the-brain-doesnt-learn-how-we-thought-it-does-new-study-reveals/"&gt; the brain doesn’t learn how we thought &lt;/a&gt;But this breakthrough takes us one step closer to fully understanding the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world filled with endless distractions and digital noise, silence may be one of the most powerful and overlooked tools for mental clarity and long-term brain health. Quiet time, it turns out, isn’t just a luxury. It’s a neurological necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/high-protein-breakfasts-without-eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; gets all the credit, and for good reason. We know that starting our day off with an ample amount of protein (around 20-30 grams) is essential for maintaining our hormone health, preventing mid-morning energy crashes, and keeping us full for longer. One might say &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/what-happens-when-you-eat-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein really is &lt;em&gt;that girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But I would like to make a case for another, equally important nutrient to kickstart your mornings—fiber. Dietary fiber is a non-digestible carbohydrate that can be found in plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Both soluble and insoluble fiber play important roles in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;, and consuming enough fiber regularly has been shown to lower cholesterol, promote a healthy GI tract (by ensuring you’re staying regular), improve blood sugar, and help reduce inflammation, to name a few &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/benefits-of-fiber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;	




&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this vital nutrient is often &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/dietician-nutrition-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overlooked&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10498976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;19 out of 20 Americans&lt;/a&gt; do not consume the minimum recommended amount of fiber each day. According to the National Academy of Medicine, women under age 50 should aim to consume &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983#:~:text=How%20much%20fiber%20do%20you,women%20age%2050%20or%20younger." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;25 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. This means choosing high-fiber foods (5-10 grams) at each meal can help you reach your daily goal. (A gentle reminder that if you don’t regularly consume large amounts of fiber, to take it slow and make sure you are staying hydrated to prevent unwanted gas and bloating.) The good news is that dietary fiber is not difficult to incorporate into your favorite &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/how-breakfast-can-change-eating-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; go-tos, plus by prioritizing fiber first thing in the morning, you can ensure that you are reaping the health benefits all day long. Keep reading for high-fiber breakfasts you can make today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-1.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526745"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://livelytable.com/peanut-butter-banana-overnight-oats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lively Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to high-fiber breakfasts, oatmeal gets all the buzz. Oats contain a prebiotic fiber called beta-glucan, which is known to feed the good bacteria living in your gut. This recipe contains a few different fiber sources—peanut butter, banana, and oats—for a well-rounded breakfast option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-sweet-potato-black-bean-avocado-breakfast-burritos"&gt;2. Sweet Potato Black Bean Avocado Breakfast Burritos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-2.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526746"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-sweet-potato-black-bean-avocado-breakfast-burritos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ambitious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beans are a great way to include both plant-based protein and fiber in your diet. One cup of black beans contains 15 grams of fiber—we love to see it! The great thing about breakfast burritos is that you can customize them to your liking. Follow this recipe with sweet potatoes and avocado, or consider using white beans with tomatoes and feta for Mediterranean-inspired flavors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-chia-seed-pudding"&gt;3. Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-3.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526747"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/chia-seed-pudding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Lemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds pack 10 grams of fiber in 2 tablespoons, making chia seed pudding a great option to keep things moving (if you know what I mean). I love making a big batch of chia seed pudding at the beginning of the week so I have it on hand when rushing out the door in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-honey-lemon-ricotta-breakfast-toast-with-figs-and-pistachios"&gt;4. Honey Lemon Ricotta Breakfast Toast with Figs and Pistachios&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-4.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526748"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/honey-lemon-ricotta-breakfast-toast-with-figs-pistachios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ambitious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this decadent toast situation, choosing a whole grain bread (look for whole wheat as the first ingredient) will help up the fiber. The combination of figs and pistachios offers additional health benefits, as figs are an antioxidant and pistachios provide heart-healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-zucchini-oatmeal-breakfast-cookies"&gt;5. Zucchini Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-5.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526749"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://livelytable.com/zucchini-oatmeal-breakfast-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lively Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, who doesn’t want dessert for breakfast? Not only do these breakfast cookies contain fiber from the oats and zucchini, but they are also made with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-flaxseeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flaxseed,&lt;/a&gt; an ingredient known to help aid in disease prevention and promote better digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-sauteed-breakfast-salad"&gt;6. Sauteed Breakfast Salad&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-6.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526750"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/sauteed-breakfast-salad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I saw this breakfast salad recipe, I honestly wondered why I hadn’t thought of this for myself. I mean, a cobb salad (bacon, eggs) basically is breakfast if you really think about it. Pack in your micronutrients and fiber from the greens and top with your typical breakfast favorites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-cinnamon-quinoa-breakfast-bowl"&gt;7. Cinnamon Quinoa Breakfast Bowl&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-7.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526751"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/cinnamon-quinoa-breakfast-bowl/#wprm-recipe-container-34219" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to grains, you don’t have to stick to only oatmeal to get your fiber in at breakfast. Quinoa is a great base because you can make it sweet, like this recipe here, or go a more savory route with eggs, greens, and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-sweet-potato-toast"&gt;8. Sweet Potato Toast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-8.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526752"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/sweet-potato-toast/#wprm-recipe-container-7048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Feel Good Foodie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s a little dated, but will sweet potato toast really ever go out of style? I’m certainly not against bread, but if you want to incorporate both more fiber and vegetables throughout your day, sweet potato toast is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-creamy-clementine-smoothie"&gt;9. Creamy Clementine Smoothie&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-9.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526753"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/creamy-clementine-smoothie/#wprm-recipe-container-33463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smoothies are an easy way to pack in fiber with various fruits, greens, and seeds. This recipe offers the antioxidant benefits of vitamin C found in the clementines while also utilizing protein powder for a filling breakfast option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-shakshuka"&gt;10. Shakshuka&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-10.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526754"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/shakshuka-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Lemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakshuka is a popular Northern African and Middle Eastern dish prepared with poached eggs in a tomato sauce flavored with spices. This recipe is a great way to start your day with a variety of veggies, and you can up the fiber by pairing it with whole wheat pita or bread.&lt;/p&gt;

I found the oats aisle and just stood there, attempting to make sense of the four dozen options in front of me, in every form, flavor, and level of added sugar. They all looked equally “processed” to me. I gave up, leaving the store without oats and with a heavy load of emotional exhaustion. And that’s just the oatmeal section of the grocery store, never mind the stacks of snacks, drinks, and condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Welcome to the new supermarket anxiety plaguing Americans who want to eat healthier but aren’t quite sure how. By now, you’re likely aware of the overwhelming, still growing evidence of the health risks of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which links their overconsumption to a greater chance of premature death, as well as to plenty of its contributors: cognitive decline, dementia, depression and anxiety, several types of cancer, heart disease, inflammation, insulin resistance, and gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Yeah, rough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What’s wild is that UPFs are a huge part of what we eat. The average American’s diet consists of about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001253?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001253?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="57 percent UPFs" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;57 percent UPFs&lt;/a&gt;; that jumps to about two-thirds for children and teens. Maybe that’s not surprising when you consider that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576254&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-37457-1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37457-1" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="up to 73 percent of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed" data-vars-ga-product-id="602ef44d-a0ea-4628-af2d-c45daf2d2181" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="2.3" data-href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37457-1" data-product-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37457-1" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576254&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-37457-1" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/uWz9/nature-machine-learning-prediction-of-the","site_id":"c7b9f75a-2f85-4251-a92e-dbc6c7213473","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Nature Communications" data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="963d606c-aa20-47bb-ab72-f4141a4c304e" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Nature Communications" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-1d8p8n5 e1aq0z090"&gt;up to 73 percent of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study by a Harvard and Northeastern University research group led by Giulia Menichetti, PhD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Menichetti’s scientists are doing more than just counting UPFs. They and other researchers are also trying to make grocery store choices easier by tackling the surprisingly difficult task of figuring out exactly which UPFs are hurting us most and why. And they’re aiming to add nuance to the narrative that any UPF is bad for you. “Large population studies have begun to show that what is currently categorized as ultra-processed food may not be equally bad for our health,” Menichetti says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-the-dangers-of-upfs-are" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;Where the Dangers of UPFs Are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Knowing what makes one package of anything better than another means decoding why UPFs are linked to so many major health problems. Researchers don’t quite know yet. In fact, there’s not even a clear, specific definition of “ultra-​processed” that all scientists agree on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What we’re not talking about is stuff like olive oil and frozen strawberries. Yes, these foods are processed, but oil pressing and flash freezing are considered minimal forms of processing, not ultra-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The definition used by many researchers comes from the Nova classification system, developed by a team led by Brazilian scientist Carlos Monteiro, MD, PhD. Nova divides foods into four groups, from unprocessed or minimally processed to UPFs, which are foods made entirely or mostly from substances extracted from whole foods or synthesized in a laboratory. According to this system, UPFs are designed to be “hyper-palatable and attractive, with a long shelf-life.” Per one of Dr. Monteiro’s studies, they also tend to be “energy-dense, high in unhealthy types of fat, refined starches, free sugars and salt, and poor sources of protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients.” So that would include cookies, sweet yogurts, energy drinks, instant soups, and food “nuggets.” Some critics say Nova puts too much weight on the number of ingredients in a product and the number of processes it goes through. Under its terms, some healthful homemade foods would be considered processed, such as hummus made from canned beans or made-from-scratch bread. Still, Nova is often used in studying exactly why UPFs do a number on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-upfs-affect-us" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;How UPFs Affect Us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“There’s no shortage of really interesting and compelling-sounding theories about how ultra-processed food might impact human health,” says Kevin Hall, PhD, who’s doing dietary intervention studies on UPFs at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One effect is straightforward: “They make people eat more,” says Marion Nestle, PhD, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University. Hall saw this in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946062/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946062/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="groundbreaking 2019 study" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;groundbreaking 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; in which 20 people spent two weeks eating a diet of 81 percent UPFs. They then spent another two weeks eating a diet with the same amount of protein, fat, and carbs but from non-UPF foods. On both diets, they could eat as little or as much as they wanted. Given that the nutrient distribution was the same, Hall didn’t expect to see a big difference—but he proved himself wrong. On the UPF diet, people ate about 500 more calories a day and, unsurprisingly, gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You might think it’s obvious that people overeat UPFs because their fat, sugar, and sodium content makes them taste really good. Those extra calories can lead to obesity, which contributes to most of the health issues linked to UPFs, Nestle says. But other researchers think that answer is too simplistic and suggest it may be that the body absorbs UPFs so quickly that they don’t make us feel full. Or that these foods lack the fiber your microbiome needs to help manage your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s also possible that processing itself can change a food in unexpected ways. Anthony Fardet, PhD, a food scientist at France’s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, cites a theory that xenobiotics, or synthetic chemicals, might be damaging. These could be lab-made additives, or even compounds leached from packaging into the food itself. Either way, xenobiotics don’t exist in nature, he says, and we don’t know how they affect our biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Emulsifiers are coming under scrutiny as well. These are substances designed to stabilize UPFs by holding together two liquids, usually oil and water. Emerging research in top journals such as Gastroenterology indicates that some of these, such as polysorbate-80 (used in foods like ice cream) and the texture modifier carboxymethylcellulose (which could be in anything from sausages to baked goods to candy), can lead to inflammation in the gut. This could prevent adequate nutrient absorption and damage your metabolism. Other emulsifiers may be harmless; some may combine to cause trouble. So, it’s complicated. “The idea is to start looking at foods not only by considering one chemical at a time, one nutrient at a time, but by looking at how these different chemicals influence each other and how the overall profile of chemicals determines the quality of food,” Menichetti says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We know this is a lot. And so do the scientists, who are only in the early stages of unpacking what makes UPFs so damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So what are you supposed to do while researchers figure it out? Tech tools might help a bit (see below). But when you’ve got to go packaged, at least aim to offset the effects we know about so far: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Pick the products that are lowest in added sugar—since added sugars are often a big sign of a less-healthy UPF. Same with sugar alcohols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Find ways to add omega-3s to your diet. A high-UPF diet generally doesn’t include much of these. Try having a meal with salmon or tuna each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Load up on fiber, since a high-UPF diet can leave you lacking here. Make an effort: Your goal should be 30 to 38 grams a day, ideally from a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Determine whether some of the foods you consume are actually increasing your hunger or your desire to eat. Consider tracking what you eat for a week. Do you notice that you eat more on certain days with certain types of foods? If you can identify which are more addictive for you, focus on alternatives to those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Menichetti and her team want to make all of this easier by diving into the thicket of details so you don’t have to—so they’ve started a database, TrueFood, to help. And they’re also wishing that the food industry had better labeling and, ideally, better foods. Nestle echoes that, saying that better regulations could force the food industry to make healthier products. People trying to eat better are “fighting the entire food system on their own,” she says. “That’s really hard to do.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

But as it turns out, these creatures make up the majority of animals alive on farms at any given time—hundreds of billions every year. And the conditions they endure are often horrifying. Overcrowding, eye mutilation, and inhumane slaughter methods are all standard practice. So why don’t we care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrés Jiménez Zorrilla, chairman of the Shrimp Welfare Project, walks us through the shocking scale of global shrimp farming, the mounting scientific evidence for shrimp sentience, and the practical reforms that can drastically reduce animal suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Nathan J. Robinson  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely had to talk to you because you wrote an &lt;a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/09/yes-shrimp-matter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; recently for &lt;em&gt;Asterisk Magazine&lt;/em&gt; that has two wonderful opening lines. &lt;span&gt;It begins, "I left private equity to work on shrimp welfare. When I tell anyone this, they usually think I've lost my mind." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an opener for an article, that's a killer. I love that. I had to just keep reading after that. What it gets at is that anyone who leaves private equity, which is a famously lucrative profession, to work on shrimp welfare has to become convinced that shrimp welfare is incredibly important. The average person will wonder: what could possibly have made you make that choice? It's probably safe to say most people have not given a second consideration to shrimp welfare. Tell us about that life choice to shift from money-making to the welfare of farm shrimp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Andrés Jiménez Zorrilla &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate you touching upon that because I do think that most people would assume that I have lost my mind, and I think that was my first reaction when I read about the problem of shrimp as a "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_patienthood#:~:text=Most%20authors%20define%20moral%20patients,%22moral%20patient%22%20is%20defined." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;moral patient&lt;/a&gt;." But the more I looked into it, the more I followed the evidence of the staggering number of individual shrimp that are farmed every year, which stands at approximately half a trillion per year. [There's] evidence of their sentience, [...] and [it has been] completely neglected. Essentially no more than maybe one or two, if any, people in the whole world were trying to improve the situation. My co-founder and I thought that this was very important for us to focus on. So I appreciate your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In] the article, you do a good job of convincing people to start thinking about something that they probably haven't thought about before. And there's this famous term "the charismatic megafauna," that is, the animals people care about. Like the pandas. They're cute. We all love the pandas. We all love Moo Deng, the famous hippo. Just charismatic megafauna. You work on what I would consider the opposite end of the spectrum, which is the uncharismatic microfauna: the animals that aren't nearly as photogenic in the human sense. You're really trying to make the case for a creature that does not possess the qualities that lead human beings to be naturally sympathetic to it, such as our concept of cuteness. But you argue that's not morally relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've lost my sense of aesthetics when it comes to animals. Someone once asked me for cute shrimp pictures, and I sent them a few, and they responded, well, clearly, you've been at this for way too long. [...] This is one of the reasons why people haven't focused on this very important problem. Now, there are some folks who are focusing on even smaller, less sympathy-[provoking] animals like insects, but at least when we launched the organization, we were definitely on the fringe. But, as you said, strangely enough, aesthetic needs and cuteness are not variables that should influence our perception of moral patienthood. [It] sounds extremely obvious when you say it out loud. But it's not an intuition that most of us grow up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we set aside our natural intuitions and prejudices, and we start to think rationally and say, okay, we believe in animal rights as a basic principle—we certainly would apply the ideas to our dogs and our cats. What you take us through is the reasoning process that gets us to why we should care about shrimp. And it seems to me, from your article, that this has two components. The first is the evidence that shrimp can have experience, that they are sentient beings that can, in fact, suffer. And then the second is the kind of quantitative element, which is rather shocking—and maybe, actually, we could take those in the opposite order. I think one of the things that really is mind-blowing about your article is the quantitative data on just how many shrimp are farmed in the world. I don't think people realize the percentage of animal farming that is &lt;em&gt;just shrimp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. And basically, when my co-founder and I launched the organization, it was the quantitative part of it that really hooked us. Because back then, these animals had been less studied than they have been today. But just when you think of the numbers, roughly half a trillion shrimp are farmed every year. To give you perspective, around 100 billion humans have ever walked the earth. We grow and slaughter around five times that number of shrimp every year. So in terms of the numbers, it's huge. And if you compare it to the number of total land farm animals, for example, to give a sense of the magnitude of the numbers that we're speaking about, all put together—cattle, chicken, etc.—that would be roughly between 80 and 90 billion animals every year. For two species of shrimp alone, it's approximately 500 billion—half a trillion. So when we're talking really about factory farming worldwide, we are really talking about shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have this incredible pie chart. It's eye-opening to look at that one pie chart, which is the number of animals alive on farms at any moment, and it's mostly shrimp—it's 51 percent shrimp. The majority of animals on farms at any even time in the entire world are shrimp, and cattle and pigs are less than one percent. So it's not an exaggeration, what you just said, that when we're talking about the farming of animals and add them up individually, it is mostly shrimp out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. And this work was done by Rethink Priorities. This has a lot of work behind it, but essentially, it is the species that is by far the most [represented] at any given moment on farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are all these shrimp going? Is it that every country just eats a lot of seafood? You've studied the industry, so what's going on here? How did we get to the point where shrimp are the majority of animals alive on farms at any given moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's threefold. The total volume of shrimp consumed in the world is about 6 million metric tons. So that's already a lot, but I think what makes it much greater in terms of the number of animals alive at any moment is the fact that they are small animals. So if you divide the number of cows that you would need to feed a family, the number of shrimp to provide them with the equivalent amount of animal protein is much greater. So that's one part. And the other one is they have a very short life cycle and are being produced—harvested and slaughtered—two or three times a year. So those would be the explaining factors. And we haven't even touched upon the number of shrimp that are caught in the wild. [Those numbers are] just mind-blowing. They're on the order of 30 trillion shrimp per year. This also comes from this paper that I refer to from Rethink Priorities in my article. It's not in the article because my organization focuses exclusively on farmed shrimp at the moment, but the number of wild caught shrimp is also astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get to why this is a problem worth working on, we have to go back to the moral dimension of what happens to shrimp. And this is where I think you have [a] heavy burden. People can look at this pie chart, and they could say, wow, that's a surprising fact—I'd never thought about that before. But they could say, and probably many of them do say, but I don't really care. I care about the cattle and the pigs because I know that pigs and cattle are like dogs. They feel emotions. They are sophisticated creatures. With shrimp, we can eat as many of them as we like, because they're shrimp. They're tiny, as you said. Why should anyone care what happens to a shrimp? They're so unsophisticated. And so this is where you lay out all the evidence and research that [justifies] a moral [consideration] of what happens to a shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct. We can unfold it, and there are two things. It's either they're not sentient and we don't care, or they're sentient and the conditions and farms are great, and again, we don't care. Okay, so we need to talk about both. The first one is the evidence of sentience. When we launched the organization, the evidence of sentience was relatively limited. But fortunately for us, right after we launched the organization, the U.K. government, as part of a revamp of their animal welfare legislation, commissioned a report from the London School of Economics to look at the evidence of cephalopods and decapods. Cephalopods are octopuses and squid, and decapods are crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. And because there is no smoking gun to decide whether a system is sentient or not, even with humans, I need to assume that you're sentient because you're similar to me and because you're telling me that you are feeling something. But I cannot definitively prove from outside that you are feeling what you're telling me that you're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what researchers do with animals is that they look at behavioral proxies for sentience that would indicate something similar to what we can appreciate in humans. And that's what the researchers at the London School of Economics did. They looked at a number of different elements, including having the right body parts to feel pain, so nociceptors, and having the right neural architecture to feel that pain and to integrate it, and then to see the responses that animals show to different noxious stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they have eight different criteria, and they rank the degree of evidence that one has in each of them. And if we look at the decapod family as a whole, there is very strong evidence that they fulfill either strongly or very strongly each of these eight categories. So the recommendation from researchers was to unequivocally include decapods, which include shrimp, as animals recognized as sentient in the new animal welfare law. And then at Rethink Priorities, Bob Fischer and his team prepared a very interesting piece as well called the &lt;a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/the-welfare-range-table/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Welfare Range Table&lt;/a&gt;, where they look at hundreds of different behaviors that would indicate sentience. This is a much more in-depth analysis of the existing evidence, and they see that shrimp can show anxiety-like states. They tend to their wounds, and this behavior is different when you apply anesthetics or analgesics, which would suggest that it is not a reflex. So there are a number of behaviors that, all put together, would strongly indicate that there's something going on in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're talking there about people who've applied a very systematic and careful method to really quantify a degree of confidence in sentience. But I've heard you mention before in a conversation that one kind of counterintuitive or unexpected thing is that the people who farm shrimp tend—more than the general public, when you survey them—to believe in the sentience of shrimp. And you might [...] expect them to be indifferent. But actually, they understand this perhaps better than the average member of the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's an extremely good point. We ran a survey of farmers in India one year after having launched the organization. And if my memory serves me well, it was something like 90 to 95 percent of the farmers that we interviewed, when we asked them the question,&lt;br&gt;do you think that your shrimp can feel pain? they all said, yes. Even one had a very endearing quote and said something like, when my shrimp are happy, I am happy, and if they are sad, I suffer too. Because they are much more attuned to, I wouldn't say individuality, but they see these animals when they're alive and showing their natural behaviors. Most people who eat shrimp, at least in the developed world, have never seen a live shrimp in their lives. So that makes a huge difference to the way that we relate to an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you mentioned earlier that there is the question of whether shrimp are sentient, and you have touched on some of the evidence that they can feel pain. But you said that we could say, okay, but the conditions are fine. So, then we get to that second part that you mentioned, which is the inquiry into how shrimp are farmed and whether they are farmed in a way that raises a serious moral issue. Obviously, you have concluded that for point number one, they are sentient. But for point number two, they are farmed in ways that are abhorrent, that hurt them, and that are avoidable. So tell us a little bit more about the conditions that shrimp are raised under that you think makes this a compelling moral issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Zorrilla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, and one important point to mention right off the bat is that not every shrimp suffers from all the elements that I will mention. Perhaps some don't. I think, for the most part, they do. But a normal life in a typical farming environment for shrimp [means that] a female has its eye cut off. That's the way that the life of a farm shrimp starts. So researchers a few decades ago realized that by removing, by crushing, one of the eyes of a female, they would start laying eggs more predictably, and it's easier to have a female reproduce and spawn when this eye is removed. So the first thing is that an eye is cut off from a female, without any anesthetic, obviously. This female lays hundreds of thousands of eggs. These eggs eventually hatch, and so you have baby shrimp. Of these baby shrimp, between natural mortality that happens in this early stage and cannibalism at this early stage, about 50 percent of those, roughly, would die. Of the ones that survive, they are then, after a few days, transferred into either an intermediate pond, or what they call a grow-out pond, where they would live for the next three to four months. And there, the conditions vary, but you have two ends of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one end, you can have a system where the water can be controlled to the most minute element of it: a small tank where dissolved oxygen is monitored and maintained, where the presence of poisonous gasses are detected and eliminated and managed. But typically, because of all the investment that these systems require, the animals are overcrowded, and they cannot express their natural behaviors, which tend to be that they burrow under the sand and rest at the bottom of a pond. Because they're packed so tightly, they need to be swimming all the time and really cannot express their natural behaviors. They're really stressed, and if you have a disease outbreak, this can spread very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum, you sometimes have ponds that are very large with very low stocking densities—only five to 10 animals per square meter, versus the other system that I mentioned which is probably 500 per square meter. In these other systems, the animals can express their natural behaviors, but because it's a larger pond, it behaves more like a natural ecosystem. And there you have fluctuating levels of dissolved oxygen and poisonous gasses. And here the problem is that you can have animals with very poor immune systems, and again, disease outbreaks. This is just a normal thing that happens in shrimp farming. In these types of ponds, it's frequent that you have mortality rates of 30 to 40 percent of all the animals that were put initially in this kind of pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last element of shrimp farming would be a harvest, which is the moment in which the animals are taken out of the water and slaughtered. The gold standard is to submerge the shrimps in cold ice, in ice slurry, and that has proven to be not effective enough to render animals unconscious when you look at the brain activity using the EEG method. It actually appears to be a very painful experience, and this is a gold standard, typically, before Shrimp Welfare Project started with its Humane Slaughter Initiative, which I'm sure we will touch upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color=""&gt;Robinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you're inherently engaged in harm mitigation rather than elimination [of farming]. Given the sheer volume that you're looking at here, the idea of eliminating the consumption of shrimp overnight is inconceivable. So I take it that you've thought a lot about, well, what are some feasible recommendations that could be adopted? What are some standards that, given the industry that we have in the world as it exists now, we think might be adopted that would go some way towards eliminating the worst aspects of this? You emphasize the cutting of the eyes. Maybe we can get rid of that. Maybe we can have shrimp more in an environment that resembles what they would have naturally. Pragmatically, if we've accomplished the very hard part of getting people to take shrimp welfare seriously, we're not going to accomplish the impossible part of eliminating the farming of shrimp tomorrow. And so what are the things that you think are best practice legislation that we can encourage the adoption of today? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best thing that consumers can do is to ask their local supermarket to commit to higher welfare standards. We have seen this now in the U.K. Half of the retail industry in the U.K. now has committed to high shrimp welfare standards, eliminating eyestalk ablation and incorporating electrical stunning to make the slaughter process painless to animals. And this really comes on the back of consumers reaching out to their supermarket and saying, hey, I like to eat shrimp, but I would like my shrimp to have been produced in the most ethical way possible. And the most ethical way possible from a retailer perspective, when they pass policies [such as in] Europe, [is to] ask their suppliers: you can no longer use eyestalk ablation as a method of spawning baby shrimps; you need to incorporate electrical stunning—so you need to incorporate humane tech to reduce suffering at the moment of death—adjusting stocking densities to the actual number of animals that each system can carry comfortably and not stretch it to the limit; and finally, guaranteeing certain water quality parameters are met so that there is enough dissolved oxygen for the animals to breathe in water and the absence of certain poisonous gasses that are detrimental to animal welfare. But first and foremost, what people can do is reach out to their shrimp dealer and ask them to source from certified shrimp and just to always push the envelope of what the level of welfare of their supply chain should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently interviewed Dulce Ramírez of Animal Equality in Mexico about [incorporating] animal rights into the Mexican Constitution, which was a major victory. One of the things I discussed with her was the fact that anyone working on animal rights and animal welfare always faces this real uphill struggle because it's inevitably [a lower priority issue]. Here in the United States, there's like 100 serious crises going on at any one time politically. And so to start to talk about animals, you feel like, well, we'll talk about animals when we've dealt with whatever these five present catastrophes are. And then, if you talk about the smaller animals, you really have a challenge, as we talked about in the early part of this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But [...] the positive thing is that there are measures that can be taken that substantially reduce the amount of suffering in the world, and your organization and this movement has, in fact, succeeded at getting some of these measures put in place by retailers, and then it has a result. It doesn't have an easy to see result because the shrimp can't write notes and thank you, but it has a payoff in that you've managed to successfully reduce a huge amount of suffering in the world. So I think one of the things we can emphasize here at the end of this conversation is the way that this issue, which may seem initially a quixotic or even utopian issue, is a quite practical way of making the world a much less horrible and harmful place for numerous conscious creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't agree more. And as a corollary to that, typically, both governments and retailers and generally corporations are comprised of individuals, and many individuals genuinely care about the welfare of animals that they are in charge of, and those individuals will be receptive and can effect change inside organizations or inside governments. But they will not be aware that this is an issue that's important to other folks, and they potentially won't even be aware of the issue if we don't make it salient. And thankfully, as you said, these very welfare improving interventions, or suffering reducing interventions, should not be expensive for suppliers. There are organizations like what I started, but I'm sure there are others that can support the industry to transition to higher welfare practices and would be very keen to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We certainly appreciate your taking the leap from the amoral world of finance to working on something like shrimp welfare. [...] People should read your &lt;a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/09/yes-shrimp-matter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, which is very compelling, in &lt;em&gt;Asterisk Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, and they should go to the &lt;a href="https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shrimp Welfare Project&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about what you've done so far and what can be done in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
