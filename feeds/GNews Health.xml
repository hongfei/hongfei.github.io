On Friday, Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, said the person is between 20 and 40 years old, she but did not identify the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said the person was unvaccinated "and has no out-of-state exposures, which indicates the infection was transmitted within Utah." The release stated that the department had identified anyone else with measles as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said during thier "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was immediately known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said the individual visited healthcare providers due to measles symptoms and was advised to stay home to quarantine, which they reportedly did following their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged those who may have crossed paths with the infected Utah County resident, especially those who are unvaccinated, to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do have to suspect there are additional measles cases in Utah," Nolen said, noting the affected individual had not traveled outside of the state, pointing to the disease originating from Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not been able to identify how that happened, so certainly there is some person who was able to transmit the virus to this individual. So we do think there are additional cases," Nolen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who have a high fever (higher than 102.2°F or 39°C) and a cough, runny nose or red eyes may have early stages of measles," the department said. "A rash will usually appear after four days of fever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash, usually showing up first at the hairline then spreading down a person's body, is described as one of the main identifying signs of measles, Nolen said in a press conference Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department noted that a person with measles can spread the disease before symptoms occur. Health officials urged those who develop symptoms to steer clear of others and call their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the department, over "90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection." The department noted that infants under 1 year old cannot get the vaccine, meaning they are not protected from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen recommended people speak with their clinicians to track down what vaccines they've had and learn more about an option to get an antibody test that will show if antibodies are present. Nolen noted there is no danger in having additional doses of the vaccination. It is recommended that people get two doses of the vaccine to make sure they are fully protected, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health in Utah wants to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation," the department said. "We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said in the press conference that the last case of measles in Utah occurred two years ago, "in an international traveler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:12:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB</guid></item><item><title>这种高温会混淆您的思维，并可能增加您患痴呆症的风险。热量如何影响大脑-多伦多星报 | This kind of heat can muddle your thinking and may raise your risk of dementia.

It has an average survival rate of 12 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, who posted his story in an &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1lbdcel/i_have_six_months_to_live_ama/"&gt;anonymous Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, has just six months left to live despite living 'a very healthy lifestyle' and having no family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I never smoked, almost never drank, ate clean and exercised daily. Sometimes biology lets you down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer affects roughly 67,000 Americans every year and kills about 52,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half the time, the disease is first spotted after it has already reached stage three or four due to its vague symptoms. These include abdominal pain, weight loss, back pain, jaundice and floating or clay-colored stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads patients to assume their symptoms are from more benign causes like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the case for Clair Honeywood, a 45-year-old from the UK who chocked her severe stomach pain up to IBS. She was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14392951/deadly-pancreatic-cancer-warning-signs-stomach-pain-IBS.html"&gt;given a year to live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Matthew Rosenblum of Michigan assumed his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13301841/diagnosed-lethal-pancreatic-cancer-miracle-drug-combo.html"&gt;bone-white stools&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 were from Crohn's disease, but it was actually stage four pancreatic cancer at age 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes pancreatic cancer, but smoking, obesity and diabetes are thought to increase the risk by inducing harmful inflammation that causes cells to divide and become mutated more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the Reddit thread, however, blames his diagnosis on bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Before this diagnosis, I was in perfect health. I thought I had another 50 years left. The first thought was “This is too soon.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former engineer said he will soon move into hospice care and try psilocybin therapy for pain and the mental health effects that have come with his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, has been thought to reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also has signed up for several clinical trials. It's unclear if he will be getting standard treatments like chemotherapy or radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Clair Honeywood (left), 45, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at stage three after mistaking her symptoms for IBS. Matthew Rosenblum, meanwhile, thought his bone-white stools were from Crohn's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, stomach pain, back pain, weight loss, and floating stools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, he is focusing on using up his savings on vacations, scuba diving, skydiving and other items on his bucket list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His main regret is not taking enough risks like 'starting a business, moving to another place, trying something you were interested in but didn't know if you could do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the end, your failures are often not as consequential as you might think,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I’m glad I’ve been able to experience life. In all the possible realities I could’ve existed in, this was a pretty good one. Even if it’s short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don’t have any grandiose aspirations for my legacy. A simple “that guy was alright” is good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The biggest piece of advice I would give is to not take the time you have for granted. I know that’s probably a worn out statement, but it rings incredibly true when you realize how finite your life really is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 18:14:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPYjFjZHUzOHNGbG00bU9CUFBvXzdZemFYaVdRWnE0NEhXSndyeXFZcG42ZjVrZnQxOGN6cWRWcXhnR0ZXdV9TVFFndTA1NTBmckVqVndWalQzUEx4Qi1oZm54NEx0V1lETE1oQmNTdXFUY3RabllvM0Q4UjFyWFRwbTV0WjI3U3BLeGc2WExFb3hnUVRzQkFkWG0zZ1laVXJpSUNFbmxhYWFqQ0VEbC0xTDZR0gG3AUFVX3lxTE43RGp2R1RzTkFpS1RGWjd0eV9CVTFLazlvVkN3dlhfQ2NuOEdFQk1WNm5heUJKRENCczNTekJfTUxVU3VUOGhTR0VaeVVvS18zdG1jaERfOG1MeDdsMkYwX0NtMThUc2dUcUNzRzNzMXI3SnM0ZWlBYzROenl1VThrZ1J4RFg0VlBNVWtWcXk5cHJ0UmlsQTBMTGZhajlPeEVHeDJsS3JOUHkxaUR2d2tMZlowZ3l4aw</guid></item><item><title>男性在获得捐赠肾脏后健康崩溃-它充斥着蠕虫- Ars Technica | Man’s health crashes after getting donated kidney—it was riddled with worms - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQVVdxSjBodGJCeThZSC1XTEpMLVh0Ny1rOExDam90WXhqVWgwbzd2VF9xY24zdzZBZWRoZHJIMWpLRFdVdHRpRkh3cGZkeWotc0V4WEVNTHhEQ0R4b2RXRHotU3F0alNBTkxOc1VhNy1tN2QyUWl6S3luRlZrc3lWSmVSczNfazA0TmlqX051MmdfRHFxWFVoYTFYeVNnUDVNa2J3aWlaeU9sbDNqWlpMYmdqOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;About two months after receiving a donated kidney, a 61-year-old man ended up back in the hospital. He was tired, nauseous, and vomiting. He was also excessively thirsty and producing too much urine. Over the next 10 days, things only got worse. The oxygen levels in his blood began to fall. His lungs filled with fluid. He kept vomiting. He couldn't eat. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. His oxygen levels and blood pressure kept falling. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Still, things kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, he was transferred to the ICU of Massachusetts General Hospital, where he had received the transplant. He was in acute respiratory failure and shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510"&gt;a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Mass General explained how they determined what was wrong with the man. Their first steps were collecting more information about the man's symptoms from his wife, reviewing his family medical history, and contacting the regional organ-procurement organization that provided the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process of elimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's condition and laboratory tests suggested he had some sort of infection. But as a transplant recipient who was on a variety of immunosuppressive drugs, the list of infectious possibilities was "extensive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Camille Kotton, Clinical Director of the hospital's Transplant and Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases division, laid out her thinking. She started with a process of elimination. As an immunosuppressed transplant patient, he was also on several medications to proactively prevent infections. These would rule out herpesviruses and cytomegalovirus. He was also on a combination of antibiotics that would rule out many bacterial infections, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482370/"&gt;fungal infection &lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis jirovecii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that strikes the immunocompromised and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563286/"&gt;the protozoan parasite &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature stood out: The man had developed elevated levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that can increase for various reasons—including parasitic infections. The man also had a reddish-purple rash over his abdomen. Coupled with the severity of his illness, Kotton suspected a widespread parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's history was notable for contact with domestic cats and dogs—including a cat scratch in the time between having the transplant and falling critically ill. But common bacterial infections linked to cat scratches could be ruled out. And other parasitic infections that might come from domestic animals in the US, such as toxocariasis, don't typically lead to such critical illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

She was given six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a decade later she is living a full and vibrant life - defying the odds in what doctors call a 'miracle' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, she began experiencing headaches and seizures, prompting her to go to the hospital. Doctors found &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14408499/unusual-sign-cancer-decade-glioblastoma-brain-symptom.html"&gt;a tumor in her brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, called a glioma, a typically fatal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-03d25b20-4df1-11f0-890e-2ff2c2bfa2b3"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; with minimal treatment options that are often unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said she had about six months to live until the cancer, which has a survival rate of about eight percent, killed her.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wethor said: ‘Because my tumor is so difficult to treat, I was able to leave the hospital and spend my "last six months" doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During those first six months, when I thought they might be my last, I made it a mission to do something creative every single day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She painted, taught herself how to play guitar, and made fashion a form of self-expression. She visited museums with her mother, which she said 'was crucial to keeping my mind off my diagnosis and current health circumstances.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she never received treatment, her symptoms – &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14808807/brain-cancer-perimenopause-symptom-sign.html"&gt;headaches, fatigue, and seizures&lt;/a&gt; – became manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Ten years ago, doctors discovered a tumor in her brainstem—a usually fatal cancer. Yet Wethor has beaten the odds, living a vibrant life full of adventure and creativity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s not always perfect, but I’ve found ways to work with my body rather than against it,’ she said. ‘Most days, I’m able to live a full and relatively normal life…I don’t assume I have time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, an advocate for cancer research, Wethor undergoes MRI scans, fearing all the time that the cancer has grown. But she hasn't let that fear take over her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A glioma of the brain stem is a tumor that develops in the area connecting the brain to the spinal cord and can come in different varieties based on the specific type of glial cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brainstem is crucial in controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, swallowing, and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to it can lead to a wide range of devastating effects that Wethor fears are lurking just around the corner, including difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brainstem gliomas are rare and more common in children than adults. Every year, there are roughly 300 cases in adults and 500 cases in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the same cancer President Joe Biden's son Beau had. He was diagnosed in 2013 and died two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My doctors can’t explain why I have survived,’ she said. ‘I still have my tumor, but miraculously, it has not grown.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for this form of cancer, leaving her wondering when her regular MRI scan will show that the tumor has grown and pressure on her brain has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors do not know what prompted the tumor to develop, how it might respond to treatment, what the best available treatments are, or whether it will come back if a patient reaches remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grace Wethor in 2020. While not in treatment, her symptoms – headaches, fatigue, and seizures – are manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;‘The hope is that one day a trial or new treatment will emerge that can help tumors in this area of the brain,’ she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wethor’s expectation-exceeding survival is nothing short of miraculous, given the tiny chance of survival given to her as a teen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘Because of the complexity of the brain stem, doctors aren’t able to biopsy or do surgery on these tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This means that as soon as these tumors start growing, there isn’t much that can be done to help the patient - especially because chemotherapy and radiation also have a slim chance of working.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation’s effect is often short-lived, chemotherapy often fails and there are no targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When symptoms appear, such as double vision, slurred speech, and imbalance, the cancer has spread beyond help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The hope is that one day a trial or new treatment will emerge that can help tumors in this area of the brain,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There have been some advancements but we still have a long way to go.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grace Wethor with her mother in 2023. Now she approaches each day as an adventure, knowing no one is guaranteed tomorrow, brain tumor or not.

And while she still gets headaches and other symptoms, she has been able to find creative outlets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer could worsen at any moment, but Wethor doesn’t fear death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social workers would ask her if she was afraid of dying, but she realized it was the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Really what I should have been asked was if I was afraid of living – living with this reality and wondering how long I and others could live under that stress and unknown,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I try to live every day as an adventure, because no one is guaranteed any amount of time, brain tumor or no brain tumor, and this experience has made that impossible to ignore.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:27:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>与帕金森认知能力下降相关的肠道、口腔细菌变化-帕金森今日新闻 | Changes in gut, mouth bacteria tied to Parkinson’s cognitive decline - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQVVlpYWVoX2dUdmJrSFJlcF9kRlB4MU1reHNELUw0ZDZXMEVzblVBTnp1LWhmM1diaUJXMzBvSDZQRjZfSjRfZ3V0eEJZd241b0hUdE9yRlFZMnRCNjU5YlRiZ25yblBydlVUNmxOX0FaWjhYQlRhWXhaYVpnRmZWYWh5SnZGSEZ0bXZKeDRXV1FPNVR0T290ZW1zcGZ1Y3Z0TXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the bacterial communities in the gut and mouth are associated with cognitive impairment in people with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some oral bacteria and related virulence factors, such as molecules that help bacteria colonize the body — many of which can trigger a potent inflammatory response — were significantly enriched in the guts of Parkinson’s patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that promoting a healthy microbiome through consistent oral care, a balanced diet, and potentially targeted probiotic interventions could support improved disease management in Parkinson’s,” Saeed Shoaie, PhD, the study’s lead at King’s College London in the U.K., said in a &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mouth-and-gut-bacteria-linked-to-brain-changes-in-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2506843#abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbiome signatures of virulence in the oral-gut-brain axis influence Parkinson’s disease and cognitive decline pathophysiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with Parkinson’s can have a range of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including gastrointestinal problems such as constipation or nausea, in the years before &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear. Changes in the gut may play a role in Parkinson’s development via the communication system between the gut and the brain, called the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the oral health of Parkinson’s patients also impacts the course of their disease, the contribution of mouth bacteria has been largely overlooked. In fact, &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, a well-studied oral bacterium, has been found in the brain of people with &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/approved-treatments-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, and active gum disease, or periodontitis, has been reported to impact cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human gut and oral bacterial communities are increasingly linked to neurodegenerative diseases,” Shoaie said. “Disruptions in the gut-brain axis could trigger inflammation and immune responses that contribute to neuronal damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Gut, oral microbiome effect on cognition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined gut and mouth bacteria collected from the stool and saliva samples of Parkinson’s patients with mild cognitive decline and dementia to explore the role of gut and oral microbiomes on cognitive impairment. A group of healthy people served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s patients with dementia had significantly less gut microbiome diversity than those with mild cognitive impairment. There was also a decrease in microbial diversity and the metagenomic species richness, or the total number of different species within a microbial community, in the oral microbiome of those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a species analysis, there was a limited number of overlapping bacterial species across all three groups, meaning many species were uniquely enriched or depleted in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This suggests “these microbial changes are likely associated with [cognitive impairment],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a predictive assessment, the changes in microbial species were sensitive enough to differentiate between Parkinson’s patients with varying clinical features, and adding data like age and sex significantly improved the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet know if the bacteria are causing the cognitive decline or if changes in the body due to Parkinson’s allow these bacteria to grow,” said Frederick Clasen, PhD, the study’s first author and research associate at King’s College London. “But our findings suggest they may play an active role in worsening symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When oral bacteria move to the gut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers then investigated so-called oral-gut translocation, wherein oral bacteria move into the gut, where they don’t usually live. Data showed the guts of patients with dementia were significantly enriched with mouth bacteria. Moreover, those with cognitive impairment or dementia had significantly higher levels of oral-specific virulence factors in the gut, that is, molecules that help the bacterium colonize the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identified virulence factors had various functions, including stress, immune modulation, adherence, biofilm formation, invasion, and metabolism. Some are important for bacteria to infect cells that line the blood vessels in the brain. At the same time, several other factors related to immune modulation were involved in producing LPS, a molecule on bacterial surfaces that triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These toxins could be used as biological markers to identify patients at higher risk of dementia in Parkinson’s,” Clasen said. “In the future, they might also be targets for new treatments that protect the brain by changing the gut environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw a drop in several types of bacteria in the mouth of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment compared with healthy people, which could suggest a loss of healthy bacterial balance, making it easier for harmful bacteria to take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides compelling evidence that the interplay between oral and gut microbiomes significantly influences [Parkinson’s] and [cognitive impairment],” the researcher wrote. “The translocation of oral microbial species to the gut, along with their associated [virulence factors], highlights new avenues for understanding disease mechanisms and developing potential biomarkers and therapeutic avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoaie said the “emerging evidence underscores the potential importance of maintaining oral and gut health in mitigating or slowing neurodegenerative processes. As people with Parkinson’s become increasingly reliant on carers, routine practices such as oral hygiene and nutritional intake may be neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Vaping might be safer than cigarette smoking, but they carry their own health risks. A New Jersey man’s electronic cigarette habit likely contributed to his fast-spreading, fatal lung cancer, his doctors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City &lt;a href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/947911"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the tragic death this month in the American Journal of Case Reports. The 51-year-old former smoker and longtime vaper developed an aggressive lung cancer that killed him just months after diagnosis. Though a causative link isn’t confirmed, the authors say more studies are needed to figure out vaping’s cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man visited a local hospital sometime in 2020 after he started to cough up blood. During the prior month, he had also been experiencing symptoms of weight loss, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. Tests soon revealed that he had a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma, specifically determined to be squamous cell carcinoma. The cancer had already started to spread and break off into pieces that reached the heart, making surgery unfeasible. He was discharged and quickly placed on chemotherapy, but to no avail. The man’s health continued to rapidly deteriorate and he died three months after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man had a history of cigarette smoking, the equivalent of 10 pack-years (meaning he smoked roughly a pack a day for 10 years). But he told the doctors he quit in 2009 and switched exclusively to e-cigarettes for the next 11 years. He regularly received lung and heart check-ups, and his last chest X-ray two years earlier was normal, suggesting his cancer only recently emerged. Because of the aggressive and non-responsive nature of the cancer, his relatively young age (most cases are caught in people over 65) and the lack of recent cigarette use, the doctors suspect that vaping probably played a part in his death.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between [vaping] and malignancy,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have gotten seriously sick from vaping before, though usually under specific circumstances. In 2019, for instance, a mysterious lung disease that affected thousands of people in the U.S. was ultimately &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-ever-happened-to-the-vaping-lung-disease-1845750495"&gt;traced back&lt;/a&gt; to toxic additives primarily used in THC-containing vapes (while the initial outbreak did subside, these cases still &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/woman-hospitalized-with-covid-19-was-actually-suffering-1847362336"&gt;appear&lt;/a&gt; occasionally). Other chemicals used to flavor vapes have also &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/popcorn-lung-how-vaping-could-scar-your-lungs-for-life/"&gt;been tied&lt;/a&gt; to rare lung illnesses. But this appears to be one of the first case reports to explicitly link vaping and lung cancer. Other &lt;a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/oral-carcinoma-associated-with-chronic-use-of-electronic-cigarettes-2161-119X-1000304.php?aid=88343"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926987/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; have found a connection between vaping and mouth cancer. Some studies have also suggested that people who both vape and smoke (so-called dual users) have a &lt;a href="https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/vaping-smoking-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer than people who only smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the overall research to date doesn’t appear to &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Evidence-update-on-the-cancer-risk-of-vaping-e-cigarettes-A-systematic-review,192934,0,2.html#:~:text=No%20significant%20incident%20or%20prevalent%20risk%20of%20lung%20cancer%20or%20other%20types%20of%20cancer%20was%20found%20in%20the%20never%20smoker%20current%20vapers%20population."&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; a significant added risk of lung cancer among people who only vape and have never smoked. And studies have also long found that vaping is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/ready-to-quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/vaping-myths-and-the-facts/#:~:text=Myth%201%3A%20Vaping%20is%20just%20as%20harmful%20as%20smoking&amp;amp;text=Nicotine%20vaping%20is%20not%20risk,of%20the%20risks%20of%20smoking%22."&gt;less harmful&lt;/a&gt; in general than smoking. Given that this case is only one anecdote, the doctors aren’t pushing for formal changes to screening guidelines just yet. But they are calling for further studies to untangle the unique dangers that vaping may pose.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

These symptoms, which can include exhaustion, difficulty concentrating, and muscle weakness, often begin within minutes to hours after orgasm and can persist for several days. Although the condition has been largely observed in men, there is growing, albeit limited, evidence that it may also affect women. A new scientific review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Sexuality &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers the most up-to-date summary of what is currently known about POIS, highlighting its symptoms, possible causes, and a wide range of treatment attempts—none of which has proven universally effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted the review because POIS remains an under-recognized condition with no established diagnostic criteria in medical manuals and no agreed-upon treatment approach. Since it was first described in 2002, only a handful of studies have attempted to systematically explore its causes and potential treatments. The review authors aimed to provide a clearer overview of the scientific literature to help both clinicians and patients better understand the condition and guide future research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the review, the authors searched the PubMed database for articles with references to POIS in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. This initial search produced 429 results, which were then narrowed down to English-language studies published between 2020 and 2025. After removing irrelevant or duplicate entries, the authors were left with 29 articles that met their inclusion criteria. These papers formed the basis for their review of the latest knowledge surrounding POIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors began by reviewing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria most commonly associated with POIS. Because the condition is not formally recognized by diagnostic systems like the International Classification of Diseases or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, researchers have had to rely on informal criteria. The most widely accepted standards were developed by Dutch psychiatrist Marcel Waldinger and his team, based on reports from 45 male patients. These criteria include flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, feverishness, and irritability; onset of symptoms shortly after ejaculation; recurrence in nearly every ejaculation; and a duration of symptoms typically lasting between two and seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later research has expanded upon these findings. In what remains the largest study of POIS to date, researcher Natale and colleagues in 2020 surveyed 302 men, 268 of whom met at least three of Waldinger’s diagnostic criteria. The most commonly reported symptoms were difficulty concentrating (reported by 84% of participants), extreme fatigue (83%), irritability (74%), and muscle weakness (70%). Many participants said they avoided sexual activity, masturbation, or even romantic relationships to prevent the debilitating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While POIS has historically been viewed as a male-only condition, newer reports suggest it may also affect women. However, these cases are rare and under-documented, and more research is needed to understand how the condition manifests in female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of POIS remains a subject of intense debate. Early studies proposed that it might be an allergic or autoimmune reaction to a person’s own semen. Waldinger’s research supported this hypothesis through allergy skin tests, which showed positive results in a large majority of POIS patients. A few case studies even documented successful treatment through desensitization therapy using diluted samples of the patient’s semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet more recent studies have cast doubt on the allergic explanation. Some patients do not show typical allergy responses, and semen-specific antibodies are not always present. Other researchers have proposed alternative explanations, including the idea that POIS may stem from a chemical imbalance in the brain, a dysregulated immune or hormone response, or nervous system dysfunction. A particularly novel theory suggests that POIS results from minor nerve damage in the pelvic muscles responsible for ejaculation, similar to conditions that cause delayed muscle pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The varied and sometimes conflicting findings suggest that POIS may have multiple causes. Different patients may experience the condition due to different underlying mechanisms, making it difficult to define a one-size-fits-all explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical symptoms, POIS is frequently associated with mental health problems. Studies have reported high rates of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in those affected. One study found that 87.5% of POIS patients had at least one of these conditions. Another found a lower, but still significant, rate of 45%. Many individuals also experience premature ejaculation, likely due to low sexual activity or anxiety about triggering symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the exact cause of POIS remains unknown, treatment has been inconsistent and largely experimental. Doctors have tried a wide range of medications and therapies, targeting the suspected underlying causes. In the 2020 Natale study, some of the more commonly used medications included antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (commonly used to treat depression), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of these, niacin and anti-inflammatory drugs appeared to be most effective for the highest number of participants, but still only helped a portion of those who tried them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches have included hormone therapy, especially in men with low testosterone levels, and psychological interventions like relaxation techniques. A few cases have reported positive outcomes from desensitization therapy or immunotherapy. In one recent and unusual case, a man underwent surgery to block semen from interacting with immune cells in his body and reportedly saw his symptoms disappear. Another case reported improvement after undergoing a microbiota transplant to alter gut bacteria, though it’s unclear whether this treatment played a direct role in his recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited number of documented cases and the diversity in symptom expression and treatment outcomes, no official guidelines exist for treating POIS. Most medical professionals are unfamiliar with the condition, and some patients report difficulty discussing their symptoms due to embarrassment or stigma around sexual health. The authors of the review stress the need for personalized approaches to treatment and encourage clinicians to work closely with patients to identify potential triggers and helpful interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier reviews on POIS exist, this new article includes a larger and more recent body of research. The authors recommend that POIS be considered for inclusion in formal disease classification systems like the ICD or DSM to promote awareness and improve clinical recognition. They also emphasize the importance of continuing to explore the condition in both men and women and testing treatment strategies in larger patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome: Insights from Recent Literature on a Rare but Fascinating Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Krystian Wdowiak, Agnieszka Maciocha, and Julia Wąż.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:05:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNYl9zcllwS0JjV3hQc2xkR2ZwR2l4aWJHTHkxTXN2d0gzOEZDWTdGT0c0dEEyNUdObE1IZ0VMZEt6TEFHU2p6S1U4bVEwV1VmdVg5dmJfb1lJTHVGeTlXTHNhcXY5bnpyb0FNMjdhVlNqR09NMGZfZzlpNGtWZmxKdVFUa3NsekhNMDliY2FJeTFxR1RaZW1uamxDOVlQRXlKUFNESWhvcnI4RkdUdF92a3hrSXQ3MUk4WHBRRkc0OTQyVV9NVUFV</guid></item><item><title>肾脏健康和不安腿综合征解释：症状、原因和治愈方法-印度时报 | Kidney health and Restless Legs Syndrome explained: Symptoms, causes, and cure - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has identified chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients—especially those undergoing dialysis—as a group at significantly higher risk of developing Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The research highlights that RLS symptoms are highly prevalent in this population and are closely associated with iron deficiency, a condition frequently seen in CKD due to chronic inflammation, poor dietary intake, and blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 meta-analysis found that nearly one in four CKD patients experiences RLS, with higher rates among those on hemodialysis. Further, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies have shown lower iron concentrations in certain areas in RLS patients, suggesting that central, rather than peripheral, iron deficiency is more relevant to symptom development. In CKD, this imbalance is often worsened by dialysis-related blood loss and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further noted that CKD patients with RLS had lower levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron, along with elevated TIBC, pointing to both absolute and functional iron deficiency. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and iron-targeted therapy in managing RLS symptoms and improving overall quality of life in CKD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome—also called Willis-Ekbom Disease—is a neurological and sensory condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. It typically occurs during periods of rest or inactivity, especially in the evening or at night, making it a sleep-disrupting disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to worsen in the evening and improves with movement. People often describe the sensations as aching, itching, throbbing, crawling, or pulling in the legs. Though it mostly affects the legs, it can occasionally impact the arms too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Signs and symptoms of RLS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. Some of its key features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discomfort after resting: Symptoms typically start when you're sitting or lying down for long periods, for example during a long drive, or while watching a move in a theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relief with movement: Stretching, pacing, or leg simple movement helps temporarily improve the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse at night: Many experience trouble falling or staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night time twitching: RLS may be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep, wherein the legs twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact on mood and focus: Chronic fatigue, depression, and difficulty concentrating are common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, RLS symptoms occur more than twice a week and can interfere with work, social life, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What causes RLS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, there's no known cause for restless legs syndrome. However several contributing factors have been identified. Genetics appear to play a role, as RLS often runs in families. One of the most significant medical links is iron deficiency, especially low levels of iron in the brain, which interferes with dopamine production—an essential chemical for smooth muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS is also frequently seen in people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, problems in the brain’s dopamine pathways, similar to those seen in Parkinson’s disease, have been associated with RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Managing RLS: What helps?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no cure for RLS but its symptoms can often be managed with the right combination of treatment and lifestyle adjustments. The first step towards tackling the issue is to address and acknowledge underlying conditions like iron deficiency, diabetes, or sleep apnea. People with RLS are often advised to avoid or limit their intake of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, especially in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the nighttime symptoms, it has been observed that Creating a regular sleep routine and maintaining a calming bedtime environment has a positive effect on the body. Further, warm baths, leg massages, or the use of heating pads and ice packs also give relief. Some devices like vibration pads or specially designed foot wraps that apply gentle pressure have also proved to provide temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在主要研究中，医生发出警告，因为常见的睡眠习惯与过早死亡的风险有关-每日邮报 | Doctors issue warning as common sleep habit is linked to risk of early death in major study - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNaDFLLWM2RnpHMi1tUU15Q21sOWtZOHZmSnJHSHZvT2tnd0JaU0phOUw5TFNNbkZUWFYzc2VnOTQ1UFNybXJDU1Q5S0hJVjhrdjZ3TFg1QjNDcGN0VkJaVS1aVGpQaUM3VnFVNUNkdVNHUDE2ZzJCaHVwenQ1UWVsWlJtVi1QNEhCekZMY1haRmhXMUJXcjc4Yi1QVHNvSkXSAaQBQVVfeXFMTk9VU0ozalY1eURtbnUtTXZSc0xTeTRYaHA1Q3o5WXRKWUxLSmtpSDF4S0RvNDc5a2Q0TTZEcmREaDZqOVRHcnFoUVhyRVg3MU1STWhqcXZCUEp0dmVsM2E3M0FDQ2d1ZGxlc3BNUW5tSlpSSGtvWHBLaVIyZG1STHhEUWxxV210bERZU3FVcTlQZ1pWNmhlZUNqTHE5czdPdjdiOFQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daytime napping may be linked to a higher risk of early death, according to a major new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery was made by researchers who tracked the sleep habits of more than 86,000 healthy middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that those who regularly napped—particularly in the early afternoon—were more likely to die prematurely than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, presented at the SLEEP 2025 conference, found the risk of death rose by up to 20 per cent among frequent nappers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say daytime sleepiness may be a warning sign of disrupted or poor-quality night-time rest, and could point to underlying health problems such as sleep disorders, dementia, or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor James Rowley, from Rush University Medical Center in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-5b7c6590-4dd4-11f0-bd39-15654a550036"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research, said the findings should influence how doctors ask patients about sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The major take-home message is that if a doctor asks about a patient's sleep habits, they should also be asking about napping,' he told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/napping-patterns-older-adults-tied-all-cause-mortality-2025a1000fn3"&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt; Medical News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In other words, doctors should be asking their patients, 'Do you nap in the day?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that longer naps, inconsistent napping schedules and napping around midday could increase the risk of early death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study focused on middle-aged adults who did not work night shifts and had no major health problems at the outset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helped to rule out other explanations for excessive daytime sleepiness and suggesting that the link with earlier death may not simply be due to existing illness or lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants' sleep was assessed over a week-long period, using actigraphy—a method for monitoring a person's sleep-wake patterns using a small, watch-like device called an actigraph. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daytime napping was defined as sleep between 9am and 7pm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants napped for around 24 minutes, with approximately a third of naps taken in the morning, between 9 and 11am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a follow-up period of 11 years, 5,189 of the participants died and overall, researchers noted that as people got older, they slept for longer later in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After adjusting for potentially confounding lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use and nighttime sleep duration, results showed that a less consistent napping routine was associated with a 14 per cent increased risk of mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found the highest risk of death was seen in people who slept for the longest during the day, with people who nap between 11am and 1pm experiencing a seven per cent increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher, Professor Chenlu Gao, from Harvard Medical School, said: 'Our study fills a gap in knowledge by showing that it's not just whether someone naps but how long, how variable, and when they nap may be meaningful indicators of future health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While many studies have examined the links between sleep and mortality, they have largely focused on nighttime sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, napping is an important component of the 24-hour-sleep-wake cycle and may carry its own health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that certain patterns of napping could serve as early indications of declining health.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned that further research is needed to better understand the biological pathways underlying these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that longer or more irregular naps could reflect underlying health problems such as heart disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14365571/Coffee-reduce-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, depression and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies suggest the explanation may lie with the impact on our circadian rhythms—the natural sleep-wake cycles that determine a host of bodily functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, also argued that being asleep during the daytime could impact the brain's ability to clear waste that builds up during the day. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come after a landmark study last year suggested almost half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—could be prevented by tackling 14 lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included hearing loss, high cholesterol, vision loss and lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claimed the study, published in the prestigious journal The Lancet, provided more hope than 'ever before' that the disorder that blights the lives of millions can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease affects 982,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2019 estimate put the annual death toll at 70,000 people a year with the health issues caused costing the NHS £700million each year to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around 2million per year, making it in the running to be among the top 10 leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking vitamin D at high doses for an extended period of time can also cause complications like hypercalcemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is where excess calcium is deposited into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of heart and kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed advised people who are worried they are not getting enough essential vitamins and minerals to take one specific supplement for their needs—for example, vitamin D supplements too boost bone health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed also said a healthy balanced diet that includes lots of oily fish, fortified foods and fibre is the best way to get all the essential vitamins the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One thing that is fantastic that I take every day is a seed mixture,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get the milled version, where they take out the hard shell, to help with digestion and some say it can also increase the nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is super high in fibre and protein and its got so many minerals and vitamins in it as well. It's a food not a supplement so this is probably the best way to make sure you get all the trace elements you need in your diet,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the latest official figures show the number of Brits being hospitalised for malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies has almost tripled in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, there were more than 800,000 admissions in England and Wales with conditions linked to poor nutrition, including 'Victorian' illnesses scurvy and rickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron deficiency was the biggest problem, NHS data revealed, with admissions for the bone-weakening condition shooting up by 149 per cent since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has, however, shown that multivitamins may serve no real health benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, a major study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that the most popular supplements — multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C — made no difference to the risk of heart disease, stroke or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folate — found in leafy greens and eggs — and other B-vitamins were seen to offer some reduced risk of heart disease, although the authors noted that the evidence for this was 'low to moderate quality'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>HPV疫苗在预防宫颈癌方面非常有效-健康专家- GhanaWeb | HPV vaccine highly effective in preventing cervical cancer - Health expert - GhanaWeb</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxOREhlVGRBRHJHWV9nMW5nc0YyRlJSVk1DRFJqVVdDdHF2SmxhUFJ4WDlqTDlvdU1NVGUzQ3pqUk9HbFRWdGpfaWpGczdMWUU0bW9CMHJ2ZG51SXlyUkllcS1QZjRZTUNBREI3ZVVNS3U2RFVZVFZWMVV6QWVKS3lkRHlQQ2Q5cF80aE1Melp1bjRvZkFjS1h1MjNnM1JvRkYycnppS0RVUkx2Zm11QTJtRzItWng4YV9jbWFFRm1EdmszU0pON2JMLUlONA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-left"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;A general medical practitioner, Dr Julian Nii Ardey Ansah, has highlighted the benefits of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in the prevention of various types of cancers and genital warts. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Dr Ansah, the HPV vaccine protects against infections caused by the types of HPV responsible for more than 90 percent of cervical cancers, as well as most cases of anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, oropharyngeal (throat) cancers, as it prevents about 90 percent of genital warts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Speaking in an interview with GhanaWeb on June 20, 2025, the medical expert described the vaccine as ‘highly effective’ and urged the public to prioritise early vaccination.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The earlier we vaccinate, the better the chances of preventing these life-threatening diseases. Parents, schools, and health authorities must work together to ensure young people are protected at the right time," he emphasised.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He explained that the vaccine provides nearly 100 percent protection against cervical pre-cancers linked to HPV types 16 and 18 when administered before exposure. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“This is why it’s most effective when given to young people before they become sexually active,” he stated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr Ansah also assured the public that the HPV vaccine is generally safe. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He listed common side effects as; pain, redness, or swelling at the injection area, as well as mild fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, or fainting particularly among adolescents, stating that rare side effects may include allergic reactions or syncope (fainting).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, he noted that the vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy and advised women to wait until after childbirth before receiving it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the recommended age for vaccination, Dr Ansah said the ideal time for boys and girls to receive the vaccine is between the ages of 9 and 14, using a two-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The recommended dose for children aged 15 to 26, is a three-dose catch-up schedule which can advisedly be administered at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Adults aged 27 to 45 may also be vaccinated following consultation with a healthcare provider, although the benefit is considered less effective due to possible prior exposure to HPV.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr Ansah concluded by encouraging parents and guardians to take proactive steps in safeguarding their children’s health by ensuring timely vaccination.&lt;br&gt;

Carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, fruit, and sweets are broken down to glucose in the digestive system, which then enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After eating, a hormone called insulin briefly rises in the body to help absorb glucose from the blood, so it can be used as energy. In healthy individuals, the body tightly regulates blood sugar levels, keeping them within a narrow range — about 4.0-4.5mmol/L when fasting, and no more than 7.8mmo/L two hours after a meal, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, even healthy individuals experience after-meal spikes which sometimes reach levels similar to those seen in diabetics, and often go unnoticed. These sudden surges can trigger energy crashes, sugar cravings and mood swings in the short term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over a longer period, frequent high blood sugar peaks can contribute to low-grade inflammation, impaired insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease — even in people without diagnosed diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news is you don't need to banish carbohydrates from your diet to keep blood sugar levels in check. Instead, health coach and parliamentary advisor Steve Bennett suggests a slow and steady approach, pairing carbs with foods that digest more slowly to help smooth out those peaks and troughs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890044" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;You don't need to say no to carbs, you just need to eat them correctly&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve says: "Big blood sugar spikes are primarily caused by ultra-processed carbohydrates, especially those stripped of fibre." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added: "Incorporating fibre (vegetables, salads, and whole grains), protein (lean meats, legumes, or tofu) and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, and olive oil) at every meal slows the absorption of sugars and helps maintain steady blood glucose levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-9-sunken-ships" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the exact two years in your life when you age the fastest. Much more on this in our weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;How to avoid blood sugar spikes&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated big blood sugar spikes contribute to insulin resistance (where your body is less able to regulate its blood sugar levels), increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even accelerated ageing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart disease is the third-leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;ONS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-us/about-the-charity/our-strategy/statistics#:~:text=Our%20data%20shows%20that%20more,by%20167%2C822%20from%202021%2D22." target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Diabetes UK, which&lt;/a&gt; estimates diabetes levels are at an all-time high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Check food packaging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890081" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;meta itemprop="width" content="615"&gt;
&lt;meta itemprop="height" content="410"&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"&gt;
&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A meal packed with protein, healthy fats and fibre is great for your blood sugar levels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve says: “Hidden sugars in 'healthy' foods like granola bars, fruit juices, low-fat yoghurts, and smoothies often contain as much sugar as desserts and are big spikers. Unexpected culprits like rice cakes (higher glycemic index than sugar), dried fruit, sushi with white rice, and even sweet potato fries can trigger large glucose spikes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommends checking labels for key indicators that food will spike your blood sugar:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5g of sugar per 100g may cause moderate spikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above 10g per 100g is likely to trigger significant glucose elevation (often marked red on food labels)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for products where fibre is at least half the sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h5&gt;2. Eat fibre first&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the Food &amp;amp; Drink Federation reveals that only 9% of adults meet the recommended 30g of fibre per day. A new survey from &lt;a href="https://www.saga.co.uk/health-insurance" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Saga Health Insurance&lt;/a&gt; suggests this shortfall may be driving blood sugar crashes, cravings, brain fog, and potential long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eating high-fibre foods before a meal can significantly reduce glucose spikes. Instead of cutting out your favourite carb-heavy snacks, start with a salad, raw vegetables, or a handful of nuts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combining high-carb foods with protein and healthy fats helps slow digestion and moderate glucose impact. For example, pair dark chocolate with almonds or have berries alongside a dessert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;3. Make smart swaps&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Brits looking to swap a chocolate bar for a satisfying, balanced snack, Steve recommends Greek yoghurt with berries, chia seed pudding, hummus with vegetables, some nuts or a boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve suggests replacing white rice with cauliflower rice for meals, using leafy greens instead of tortillas, and swapping tropical fruits for lower-glycemic berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890062" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"&gt;
&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Energy crashes and sugar cravings are signs of high blood glucose spikes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h5&gt;4. Move after meals&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don't need to do intense exercise to be healthy. It turns out you can eat your favourite foods in moderation and resist sugar spikes by taking a 10-minute walk after eating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve notes that this can reduce glucose spikes by up to 30%. Gentle movement helps muscles use up excess sugar before it accumulates, he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;5. Avoid nighttime snacks&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bodies become more insulin-resistant in the evening, meaning the same food eaten at night causes a higher glucose response than if it were eaten earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health coach explained: "Nighttime spikes disrupt sleep quality, impair overnight cellular repair, and contribute to morning brain fog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They also interfere with growth hormone release, which happens primarily during deep sleep and is essential for tissue repair and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPX2tlalZhb2xwWm5lajdMYXNyWDR6TFlucEEwSUxid05NVEFGUFdhS0xKUnpBYmVQbE5zQldHemFYTFdlN1g4bFY2UFl4LUR3cHp0S1ZBbGRYa0RMYzVhTnQ3ZmExVlJiU0lTdjgwRDNJOV9LbVI4TGRTQW1QaXlwNnJYVQ</guid></item><item><title>通过吃一种含有“关键”营养素的水果来帮助降低血压- Surrey Live | Help lower blood pressure by eating one fruit with 'crucial' nutrient - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPbUM1ZS1DZnpoQjVqejlnUXR2RnFMQkNkSXJrNjhwZDBMV09WcGExUlVRYjBLV3g3T2lKOW5MRm15aWlVMHlsNHBXN2NOMm5uT2JWU3VTS0NRMEFUdThGTURGeWZoX1V3cFpPeVkwSFFBMVUzTXg4SGVXNzRUQ09JZ1kyWGZVdm1H?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;is good for our health&lt;/a&gt; and the more different plants you can eat the more nutrients you will be getting into your system and the healthier &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; will be.

But there are many other important nutrients that we hear a lot less about, despite their importance to our health. Among them is magnesium, which is involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, registered dietitian Patricia Bannan &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-magnesium-rcna202425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Today&lt;/a&gt;. But "despite its importance, about half of US adults don’t get enough magnesium from food", she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways to increase your magnesium intake — and you can do it simply from eating the foods you come across easily in any supermarket, instead of having to spend a fortune on expensive food or supplements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is magnesium and why is it important?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that helps several bodily functions, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;turning the food we eat into energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; making sure our cells, organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820677/#:~:text=Magnesium%20(Mg)%20is%20involved%20in,of%20the%20blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;brains are functioning as they should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stabilising moods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining our muscles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;aiding vitamin D in travelling around the body&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;making sure the glands which aid bone health work normally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as the above, scientific research also shows it may play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/429?ref=circle-magazine-health-wellness-genetics-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;improving symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654669/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mild depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;help improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There's also evidence that healthy magnesium levels help your heart health. And one review of evidence found that people with higher intakes of magnesium had an &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#meta-analysis" rel="nofollow"&gt;8% lower chance of developing high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those with the lowest intakes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-9-sunken-ships" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the exact two years in your life when you age the fastest.

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fruit is high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can get magnesium in several different fruits (and other foods) but one of the best is the &lt;b&gt;passion fruit&lt;/b&gt; , which contains 4-5 grams of magnesium per fruit. One &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00617/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;study in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal&lt;/a&gt; said that "more than 110 phytochemical constituents" have already been found in the plant which shows "a wide range of health effects and biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-tumor, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic activities". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "These outstanding results suggest that passion fruit may offer a range of health benefits, such as managing inflammatory and neurological disease, and also preventing some chronic diseases like hypertension and hyperlipidemia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today.com notes that "the pulp of the aromatic fruit can be eaten raw, as a yogurt topping, or added to juices and drinks" and adds that it "also tops the list of fruits with the most protein".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What other foods are high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of other good sources of magnesium, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;leafy green vegetables like spinach or chard, as well as green peas, sweetcorn and potatoes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds like almonds, cashews, chia seeds, peanuts and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;legumes like black beans and edamame beans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits like avocado, banana, papaya, blackberries, kiwis and figs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rebecca McManamon, consultant dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, told the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that you are probably reaching the recommended daily amount of magnesium if you’re eating unsalted nuts or wholegrains daily, along with a variety of fruit, green vegetables and legumes. She added: "If these are not foods you eat regularly, you may be at a higher risk of not getting enough magnesium." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists adopt the "food first" approach to getting the nutrients we need. Professor Tim Spector, of Kings College London, says he generally believes supplements to be ineffective and that, unless people are dealing with specific health issues, most of us should be able to get the nutrients we need from food. And registered dietitian Anna Taylor told the Cleveland Clinic: "Food first is my mantra. If you take a dietary supplement for magnesium and take too much, you may experience uncomfortable side effects such as cramping, diarrhea and nausea."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do I know if I'm eating enough magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taylor told the Cleveland Clinic that eating the following would be a good way of getting the amount of magnesium your body needs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Five servings of fruits and vegetables per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;At least three servings of whole grains per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One ounce of nuts or seeds per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One serving of legumes most days of the week.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it's important to note that if you eat those recommended amounts, you'll also be getting several other nutrients and health benefits that those food contains, including fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPbUM1ZS1DZnpoQjVqejlnUXR2RnFMQkNkSXJrNjhwZDBMV09WcGExUlVRYjBLV3g3T2lKOW5MRm15aWlVMHlsNHBXN2NOMm5uT2JWU3VTS0NRMEFUdThGTURGeWZoX1V3cFpPeVkwSFFBMVUzTXg4SGVXNzRUQ09JZ1kyWGZVdm1H</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic时代正在迫使精英阶层改变健康休养地-《华盛顿邮报》 | The Ozempic era is forcing wellness retreats for the elite to change - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOU1psSHVlT3pITnV4QkVzUXg4clhvd2x4VllSRHk5TXh6VDd0RUtUYS1ILWtnY05rSnk3LS1iYlRVMXpZcUtySm91X2pCS1NjbGVsVWNSYVE5ZnhwQVQ5d0dCeHc5V2RrUUt0QS1DQ3dmZU84YVNwNWhXRnViMTJ5aVNWYUtUUFI1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="53Z432Y3SRG5NAJUCFCJNQWYJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was 3 p.m., and already Mitra Mechanic had completed a yoga class and a four-hour guided hike. Peeling off her sweat-soaked clothes and devouring a snack — a few pieces of raw vegetables and a meager dollop of hummus — she steeled herself for the next workout on her packed schedule: strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ST2NW4WRUNCY3F6YDJ2HZH46KU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mechanic, a 55-year-old tech industry worker from Austin, was attending &lt;a href="https://www.mountaintrek.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mountain Trek&lt;/a&gt;, a wellness retreat in the mountains of British Columbia that promises to overhaul guests’ health in as little as a week. The cost of that week? $6,900 per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EHLVSGXUFRDTBMWR7WACDUOHKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On paper, Mechanic was looking for a “reset” after a stressful period. But like many of her fellow attendees, she was also hoping to slim down on the rigorous program. She was prescribed the highest dose of the GLP-1 prescription weight loss medication Mounjaro for her Type 2 diabetes, but she hadn’t experienced the transformative weight loss many people report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSFBHEC7JZCVTCZ4KO5IKYHBUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m some sort of a unicorn case,” she sighed. She even hired a personal trainer, but that hadn’t meaningfully moved the scale in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MTFFOQQWEJBNZKVLIHVCAAWFWU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I had done all those other things,” Mechanic said, “so this was something completely new to try.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="22RL63JW5RF4JGNINZSNQJCCJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Mountain Trek launched its first wellness program in 2000, it attracted a steady stream of affluent guests looking to overhaul their health and drop pounds fast. Twenty-five years later, medications like Mounjaro and Ozempic can yield dramatic weight loss while requiring less money and effort than a luxury wellness retreat. In response, Mountain Trek and similar retreats are evolving to meet the needs of a new type of guest: medicated, motivated and seeking support. Some wish to supercharge their weight loss progress, while others need help mitigating unwanted side effects such as digestive discomfort and significant muscle loss. Then there are those who hope to taper off the drugs for good without regaining every pound lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RNPSI2MT7RHINEUOBSU7YRZK2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are people that come, and they’ve been on it for three years, and they’re just so tired of feeling nauseous and constipated,” said Mountain Trek co-owner Kirkland Shave. “They have come to Mountain Trek to get off of it. To learn accumulated lifestyle habits, so that they don’t then gain all the weight back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XGRAZ327BCXDFPWBR7B3KU2U4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition to Mountain Trek’s usual program — physical activity, nutritious yet low-calorie food, lectures on topics including sleep and willpower, massages, sauna and cold plunge circuits, and stress-reducing mindfulness techniques — guests on GLP-1s can book additional private sessions with a personal trainer or nutritionist and schedule follow-up coaching sessions after returning home to maintain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4FOHZBEJOVCUVJWW6IGGGCSXDM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4FOHZBEJOVCUVJWW6IGGGCSXDM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;GLP-1s: Friend or foe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="REO3MB5DPNCGTJMKO5TFZP7WHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like Shave, some retreat owners are finding opportunity in the imperfections and challenges associated with GLP-1s rather than seeing them as an existential threat to their business models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J3FWGEEKSZFYNHYWJ7QOY3T6FU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Alex Glasscock, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.theranchlife.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Ranch&lt;/a&gt; — a luxury health retreat known for its celebrity clientele, strenuous morning hikes and trail snack of precisely six almonds dusted with “Ranch Caviar” (black salt) — says his team has been fielding requests from people who lost a significant amount of weight on GLP-1s and now feel inspired to address other aspects of their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63TRFB5AGFEOVBC5RKLAUNMYOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It gives people who have been struggling with excessive obesity the opportunity to get into a weight zone, or a body-type zone, that actually gives them the self-confidence, the self-esteem and the pattern interruption to empower them to eat healthier and exercise more,” Glasscock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RETJSQ7TDRA5VBAWLI7YWMT3MM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Ranch responded to these requests by launching a private GLP-1 program. Starting at $12,200 for six nights, it enlists a nutritionist, hiking guide and personal trainer to help guests build muscle, improve overall fitness and learn about optimal nutrition. The offering has been “quite popular,” according to Glasscock, and the company expects interest to grow alongside the ubiquity of weight-loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KEPPWPQ4KJG2XGCCUP2447AVLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/wellness-retreat" target="_blank"&gt;Pritikin Longevity Center&lt;/a&gt; in South Florida says about 10 percent of its guests are taking GLP-1s. A two-week stay at the center starts at $14,000 and includes a personalized program devised by physicians, nutritionists, trainers and psychologists. Each retreat typically begins with a medical consultation including blood panels, an exercise tolerance test and a DEXA body scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MI5GD3XH2ZEYPKCIVRMVM65EVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s a big percentage of the population that either has tried them already or that will use them, and we know this is not going anywhere,” said Pritikin’s medical director Marianela Areces, who says the center can make a partner with the drugs instead of an enemy. “Our program is actually helping guests that are on these medications to be able to tolerate them and stay on them and avoid the side effects, or mitigate some of the negative effects that these medications may have.” A new Pritikin meal plan called the GLP-1 Plate, for example, increases the serving of protein to prevent muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGKJG4UL4ZHFPFIFK3IDM3ZNTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Occasionally, Pritikin’s on-site physicians will prescribe GLP-1s as part of a patient’s customized weight loss program. Last year in April, the center hosted a 30-year-old man for a month-long stay. His goal, Areces said, was to start taking Mounjaro under the supervision of the center’s doctors, which he did alongside a high-protein, low-fat diet and weight-resistance exercises. By the fall, adhering to Pritikin’s strategy had produced the desired result. During a subsequent week-long visit, a body composition test indicated he’d lost 80 pounds while preserving muscle mass, Areces said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQIVZJBKPVCFXL3G3ZA5646XTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That Pritikin guest declined to be interviewed, but according to Areces, the results of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;his hard work in the gym and kitchen gave him the confidence to begin slowly reducing the medication under the guidance of Pritikin’s endocrinologist. “He was very motivated, and he wanted to come off. He’s like, ‘I can do this,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XC4IK7UYFG3RFPLKSMJHK5C4Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XC4IK7UYFG3RFPLKSMJHK5C4Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What a magic shot doesn’t provide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HY4UAW5MT5EYHHVMLV5VVNOCIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the final morning of her Mountain Trek retreat, Mechanic reported to a private office behind the gym for her final weigh-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CXATFKG5NAIDNABNVLFIPLY7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I lost six or seven pounds in the week, which I hadn’t [done] this entire time on Mounjaro,” she said. Back in Austin, Mechanic’s doctor also ran a blood test to see how a week of extreme wellness had affected her blood sugar levels. “He was stunned at how much of a significant drop it had,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="62KTP7BWIRFONKM3E4I5Z73J2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weight loss, lower blood sugar and better digestion are virtually guaranteed in a luxury health retreat’s structured, temptation-free world, but integrating the program’s teachings back home is challenging. Mechanic has regained some of the weight she lost at Mountain Trek, but she says other lessons from the experience have stuck, particularly the “de-stressing and relaxation piece.” Her menopausal sleep issues have improved, and she occasionally visits a local cold plunge studio for its reputed metabolism-boosting, inflammation-lowering benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WJS4WDUMJE45DLL6Z44WR3G4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is a Mountain Trek retreat worth its high price tag? Mechanic says it is. She’s completed the program twice and hopes to return for a third time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGS5GCXGS5GZ7DCX3GELF5SERA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That sense of accomplishment at the end of the week is really pretty invaluable,” she said, reflecting on a world where so much — including weight loss — is increasingly effortless. “When you finish the week of Mountain Trek, you look back at the lows, like when you’re on a mountain you’re ready to jump off because you’re so winded, and then the highs of sitting in the hot tub at the end of the day, chatting with the group, looking at the beautiful scenery. For me, it was like, &lt;i&gt;my body was able to do that. &lt;/i&gt;It’s much more than weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQ3LX4OUQBAMPE4RYDF34KYEEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Esme Benjamin is a freelance travel and wellness writer based in New York City.

The drug, an antiretroviral, works not by stimulating an immune response, but by blocking HIV from reproducing during its early stages—specifically, by disrupting the function of the virus’s capsid protein. This happens so long as the body receives injections every six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Lenacapavir has already been approved in some countries as a treatment for HIV in people with forms of the virus that are resistant to other treatments. However, prior to this week, its prophylactic use had not been approved anywhere, making the FDA’s decision a significant new development in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The drug is not the first medicine that can be taken preemptively to protect against an HIV infection: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills were already available in many countries, including the United States. But these must be taken every day, and ensuring ongoing access to these medicines, and that people actually remember to take them, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lenacapavir-usaid-hiv-aids-funding-cuts/"&gt;is a known challenge&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hoped the long-lasting effects of lenacapavir will make it easier for people to stay protected against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to its creator, Gilead Sciences, lenacapavir will be marketed under the trade name Yeztugo. The company has committed to manufacturing 10 million doses by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“This is a historic day in the decades-long fight against HIV. Yeztugo is one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of our time and offers a very real opportunity to help end the HIV epidemic,” Daniel O’Day, president and CEO of Gilead, said in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/yeztugo-lenacapavir-is-now-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-hiv-prevention-option-offering-6-months-of-protection" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/yeztugo-lenacapavir-is-now-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-hiv-prevention-option-offering-6-months-of-protection"}' href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/yeztugo-lenacapavir-is-now-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-hiv-prevention-option-offering-6-months-of-protection" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, lenacapavir’s price may be a barrier to access.

This kind of testing – monitoring the health of people who regularly work with H5N1-infected animals – is how the vast majority of cases (64 out of 70) have been found in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But then, several CDC officials overseeing the bird flu response were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-health-layoffs-include-staff-overseeing-bird-flu-response-source-says-2025-04-01/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since then, only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have been tested after exposure to sick animals – and no positive cases have been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s also been difficult to understand the extent of the outbreak and how the virus spreads among animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We still just don’t have a good picture of the scope and scale of this outbreak – we never really have.

This funding was used to monitor, test, vaccinate and otherwise respond to public health issues at the state, local, territorial and tribal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re seeing health departments scrambling,” Nuzzo said. “That infrastructure is just dramatically eroding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;International monitoring programs to address outbreaks before they expand across borders have also been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have taken for granted all of those protections, and I fear that we are poised to see the consequences,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Trump’s crackdown on immigration also poses a major challenge in detecting cases and treating patients during outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A lot of the people who are most at risk are strongly disincentivized to report any cases, given that many of them are undocumented or are not US citizens,” Rasmussen said. “Nobody wants to go get tested if they’re going to end up in an Ice detention facility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When cases are not detected, that means patients are not able to access care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although it’s rare for people to become sick with H5N1, for instance – the virus is still primarily an avian, not a human, influenza – this variant of bird flu has a 52% mortality rate globally among people with known infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Allowing a deadly virus to spread and mutate under the radar has troubling implications for its ability to change into a human influenza without anyone knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if such changes were detected, widening gaps in communication could be the next hurdle for preventing a pandemic, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Communication is our most important public health intervention. People, in order to be able to know how to protect themselves, need to have access to facts, and they need to believe in the messengers. And the communication around the measles outbreaks are deeply eroding our standing with the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even stockpiled vaccines and other protective measures, like personal protective equipment, take time to distribute, Nuzzo added. “And flu is a fast-moving disease that could cause a lot of damage in the months it would take to mount a vaccination campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US government’s cancellation of its $766m contract with Moderna to research and develop an H5N1 vaccine also signals a concerning strategy from health officials, Nuzzo and Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other restrictions on vaccine development, like a new plan to test all vaccines against saline placebos, is “going to make it extremely difficult to approve any new vaccine” and would “have a devastating impact on our ability to respond to a potential pandemic”, Rasmussen said – especially in a rapidly moving pandemic where speed matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You don’t have time for that if this virus causes a human-to–human outbreak,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All of these policies mean the US is less prepared for a pandemic than it was in 2020, she said. And it also means there will be preventable suffering now, even before the next big one strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are actively making people less safe, less healthy and more dead,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPNF9rb2RSUDhTOEZ6ZmttenFjaHA0RWNJQ0hYbFNTRDVUaG94b3huM0Y1elRPU1U2ajNjUlNhQWhqOUY4ZTdpRjhxNTIyQ1JzV1RBWmZMMVBFLVBYb0xaS3VqN1ZVUXlOcGgzSDZvdWl5OVQwdlItRDdDNE0waFV2YlNnc1Z0YjVJMWRoUGVRSFg4dDVKS19heVpRV3VLQkgt</guid></item><item><title>Wegovy效应：一种新药重塑了肥胖青少年的生活-路透社 | The Wegovy effect: A new drug reshapes the lives of teens with obesity - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1RZmV5TnpwZkZjLXhCRGRIUW4tWTlaYmpPRVdsNUVZQzZLbVgtNHNzcFZCOERNR1NoRzBYSXM2X2dpYWI4N21FQ0szRHFac3JlR2pzYjlGMkFBQzNwY291cUdsSEF0LWJZX3VZcUt6VXk1Zk1rSnEtcjB4d2FLdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1RZmV5TnpwZkZjLXhCRGRIUW4tWTlaYmpPRVdsNUVZQzZLbVgtNHNzcFZCOERNR1NoRzBYSXM2X2dpYWI4N21FQ0szRHFac3JlR2pzYjlGMkFBQzNwY291cUdsSEF0LWJZX3VZcUt6VXk1Zk1rSnEtcjB4d2FLdw</guid></item><item><title>感染多达30%美国人的常见脑寄生虫干扰神经元通信- IFLScience | Common Brain Parasite Infecting Up To 30 Percent Of Americans Disrupts Neuron Communication - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOeHFNQ2QxOXBqaXJnZ2NLbmFuQWpZZlo5Z3VaeVV1d2NPcWxBLUdzS3IxOTFZT0tadm8wek5POG1LLVh3R1ZXbE1QX3dJNjlEM05OUlcxM2w0YVByd0xrWlUwcXJLMEJGelUzYzZsUHdZUl9OdEEycDZoSkNkdW5GTHpwVEJDOXU4a1hselk4NDhrTEpwX3hyVk5SbkNnQzBlLVptclY5MTlLQXc5V2g3Sm5IMzB6eVpPd3JjSlc0TzRSQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii &lt;/em&gt;is an opportunistic bugger, capable of infecting pretty much any warm-blooded animal and has a particular preference for living in brain cells. Once someone or something is infected, the parasites form cysts in neurons that can last for life. Many people who are infected by the parasites (around 10 to 30 percent of the US) often don’t even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite is often contracted from undercooked meat or exposure to cat feces. In many cases, infected people are asymptomatic, but some people do develop flu-like symptoms like fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. They may also have swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the neck. None of these symptoms are peculiar to the parasite and are common to other infections. Individuals with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weakened immune systems&lt;/a&gt;, however, can experience more severe symptoms, including confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and are unsteady on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has even been claimed that getting the parasite can do wonders for your dating life, at least according to one study from &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-infected-by-brainaltering-cat-parasite-are-more-attractive-finds-study-63735" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a person’s immune system will keep the parasite in check, but it can stay dormant in their brains for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, diagnostic tools can only detect whether a person has been exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; by identifying antibodies. This, unfortunately, does not tell doctors whether the parasite is still present in the brain or how and to what extent it has impacted their brain function. But that may soon change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found that infected neurons release fewer extracellular vesicles (EVs), tiny packets surrounded by a membrane that are used by cells to exchange information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment,” Emma H. Wilson, a professor of biomedical sciences in the Riverside School of Medicine, who led the research, explained in a &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings could represent a new way to use EVs as biomarkers that can be isolated in a person’s blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing research has focused on mouse models and human cells in a laboratory setting. In essence, in healthy mouse brains, astrocytes – a type of glial cell that makes up the majority of cells in the central nervous system – regulate neurotransmitters like glutamate. This ensures that neurons do not become overexcited (where a neuron fires signals too rapidly, not that it is looking forward to something). But when infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, the neurons stop sending the right EV signals, resulting in regulation stopping and higher levels of glutamate, which can lead to seizures, neural damage, or altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought,” Wilson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson and colleagues are now looking to analyze human blood samples for EVs linked to the parasite infection. They also hope to better understand how glial cells detect and respond to the parasite proteins, potentially offering new therapies or even vaccines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;,” Wilson explained. “If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its impacts, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; is often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no need to avoid someone who is infected; most people live their entire lives without symptoms,” Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant individuals should be cautious as the parasite can cause serious birth defects if contracted for the first time during pregnancy. The most effective prevention is proper food handling and hygiene. Cook meat thoroughly, wash vegetables, and always wash your hands after handling cat litter, especially from young cats, which are more likely to shed the parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:50:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOeHFNQ2QxOXBqaXJnZ2NLbmFuQWpZZlo5Z3VaeVV1d2NPcWxBLUdzS3IxOTFZT0tadm8wek5POG1LLVh3R1ZXbE1QX3dJNjlEM05OUlcxM2w0YVByd0xrWlUwcXJLMEJGelUzYzZsUHdZUl9OdEEycDZoSkNkdW5GTHpwVEJDOXU4a1hselk4NDhrTEpwX3hyVk5SbkNnQzBlLVptclY5MTlLQXc5V2g3Sm5IMzB6eVpPd3JjSlc0TzRSQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁的男子死于癌症后，医生告诉他胃痛是由于压力|热门-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报 | 40-year-old man dies of cancer after doctors told him stomach ache was due to stress | Trending - Hindustan Times - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/trending/40yearold-man-dies-of-cancer-after-doctors-told-him-stomach-ache-was-due-to-stress-101750415730568.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 40-year-old father of four in the UK died from bowel cancer just eight months after he began experiencing stomach pain, which he initially believed was due to stress, a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/dad-40-dies-cancer-after-35417374" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Mirror UK said.

With four children aged 12, nine, three and one, Kyle agreed to six rounds of chemotherapy and further treatments to give himself a chance to defeat the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it continued to spread and led to his death months later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Also read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/man-goes-to-doctor-for-toothache-leaves-with-a-shocking-prostate-cancer-diagnosis-101736832713384.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Man goes to doctor for toothache, leaves with a shocking prostate cancer diagnosis"&gt;Man goes to doctor for toothache, leaves with a shocking prostate cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don't ignore these symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before passing, he urged others to be proactive about health issues and not dismiss conventional symptoms if they continue to affect one's health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The common symptoms of bowel cancer can include changes in your bowel movement, stomachache, feeling lumps in your abdomen, unusual bloating, unexplained weight loss and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to experts, one should seek medical help if any of these symptoms continue for three weeks or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Also read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/womans-itchy-legs-turn-out-to-be-rare-cancer-doctors-dismissed-symptoms-for-months-101746094193089.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Woman’s itchy legs turn out to be rare cancer, doctors dismissed symptoms for months"&gt;Woman’s itchy legs turn out to be rare cancer, doctors dismissed symptoms for months&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:48:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>50岁以下女性黑色素瘤病例增加- Axios | Melanoma cases rise in women under 50 - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE4yaEViUmJLcGZNYmZUMXpqOHVRbG05Y0NqbDFxY1dRaGR0QlZzLXdfZmd4SExSWENjdTJ5dk1ZaExfSjNjSEdEUmR3eklyTkFpLUxMU1p3aXVxZUF2S2NVS1lUUXdZdUlwNE9qM3Q2RUg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 09:06:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE4yaEViUmJLcGZNYmZUMXpqOHVRbG05Y0NqbDFxY1dRaGR0QlZzLXdfZmd4SExSWENjdTJ5dk1ZaExfSjNjSEdEUmR3eklyTkFpLUxMU1p3aXVxZUF2S2NVS1lUUXdZdUlwNE9qM3Q2RUg</guid></item><item><title>开创性的研究表明，每天一个鳄梨可以帮助您睡得更好- SciTechDaily | One Avocado a Day Could Help You Sleep Better, Says Groundbreaking Study - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOSXdtTEtHN24tLUZpdnVMcENCWGFhODg2Nzh3VjNHdHZZVjRqNXZadVd3NGtkbHVPOGlnMW1WZmlidUp5VllyeEV5cThTWlREWnJRNUhkMlBXUl9aZzhORjZwamNsaHdraHJocXg2SzBzLXZHeUtnZDF3dUZRZkNOV2hBdGFfd0tNaC1yMkw5VHFTbldQTDFVU0dkdFNrdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 09:05:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOSXdtTEtHN24tLUZpdnVMcENCWGFhODg2Nzh3VjNHdHZZVjRqNXZadVd3NGtkbHVPOGlnMW1WZmlidUp5VllyeEV5cThTWlREWnJRNUhkMlBXUl9aZzhORjZwamNsaHdraHJocXg2SzBzLXZHeUtnZDF3dUZRZkNOV2hBdGFfd0tNaC1yMkw5VHFTbldQTDFVU0dkdFNrdw</guid></item><item><title>孩子们正处于危机之中。聊天机器人治疗有帮助吗？ -《纽约时报》 | Kids Are in Crisis.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The disease-causing bacteria thrive in warm, moist environments and are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can contaminate water or soil. They’re found worldwide, but as temperatures rise due to climate change, they’re becoming increasingly common in cooler areas, including the Northeast, said Marieke Rosenbaum, co-senior author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Humans can contract the disease when infected water or soil gets into the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24021-leptospirosis" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24021-leptospirosis"&gt;eyes, nose, mouth, or a break in the skin.&lt;/a&gt; Those at highest risk are unsheltered adults, veterinarians, sanitary workers, and farmers. It can be treated with antibiotics when properly diagnosed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rosenbaum said it’s hard to say how many people have been infected with the disease in Boston, as many don’t get tested because they are asymptomatic or only receive a diagnosis if their illness is severe. But the study did track one human case of leptospirosis from 2018 in the city and found that it likely originated from a rat. The patient was hospitalized but ultimately recovered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There is a need for more awareness about this disease in this area, also among clinicians,” she said. “A lot of times it’s a disease that clinicians will test for in more extreme cases … but not everyone develops such serious illness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The paper is part of a larger project out of Tufts dubbed the &lt;a href="https://apha.confex.com/apha/2022/meetingapi.cgi/Paper/515829?filename=2022_Abstract515829.html&amp;amp;template=Word" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apha.confex.com/apha/2022/meetingapi.cgi/Paper/515829?filename=2022_Abstract515829.html&amp;amp;template=Word"&gt;Boston Urban Rat Study&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on the role rodents play in spreading human diseases. Researchers hope the most recent study, which was published in April, will bring new attention to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;leptospirosis — one of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441858/#:~:text=Leptospirosis%20is%20an%20infectious%20disorder,through%20infected%20soil%20or%20water." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441858/#:~:text=Leptospirosis%20is%20an%20infectious%20disorder,through%20infected%20soil%20or%20water."&gt;most common infections transmitted between humans and animals worldwide&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898795/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898795/"&gt;largely considered neglected&lt;/a&gt; in terms of research — and give public health experts new ideas for how to control rat infestations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s a really unique population of people that are at high risk for contact with rats,” Rosenbaum said. “I hope this will raise some awareness about populations that could be targeted [with interventions], like people who are homeless or are engaged in outdoor injection drug use, in particular.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In January, a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/10/science/boston-rat-population-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/10/science/boston-rat-population-climate-change/"&gt;study published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science showed that the rat population in Boston &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads6782" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads6782"&gt;increased by 53 percent between 2011 and 2021&lt;/a&gt;, likely due to warming temperatures extending their foraging and breeding period. As climate change continues to intensify, so will the spread of disease, Rosenbaum said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ariana Eggleston, the director of rat education for the &lt;a href="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/"&gt;Rat City Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt;, an annual Allston music festival that raises awareness about the neighborhood’s large rodent population, said the results of the study are “very worrying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Not only do you have to be careful, you also have to make sure your dog’s feet are clean, you have to be hypervigilant,” Eggleston said, adding that many residents are “exhausted” from mitigating their risk of catching other infectious diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/05/metro/can-bird-flu-kill-humans-massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/05/metro/can-bird-flu-kill-humans-massachusetts/"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Eggleston said a lot of her work with the festival revolves around educating people in Allston-Brighton — &lt;a href="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/why-rat-city" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/why-rat-city"&gt;dubbed “Rat City”&lt;/a&gt; — about the importance of reporting broken trash cans, overflowing bins,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and other items that can attract rats. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

The strategies include &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/17/metro/boston-rodent-action-plan-rat-problem/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/17/metro/boston-rodent-action-plan-rat-problem/"&gt;getting rid of rats’ food sources&lt;/a&gt;, especially by making sure the public knows how to properly dispose of trash; targeting neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of rats, including &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/07/18/boston-launches-new-rat-plan-using-recommendations-from-leading-expert/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/07/18/boston-launches-new-rat-plan-using-recommendations-from-leading-expert/"&gt;downtown, Chinatown, and Allston/Brighton&lt;/a&gt;; and using technology to more aggressively seek out and get rid of their hiding places and escape routes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s a huge need for a concerted effort to sanitation,” Rosenbaum said, adding officials should focus on areas where humans have the most interactions with rodents. “And ultimately, if we restrict their access to food and water, they won’t be able to reproduce, and that will manage their populations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dave Wagner, co-senior author of the study and executive director of the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University, said establishing that local rat populations have their own strains of the disease could improve mitigation techniques. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Using information about distinct strains and populations, researchers tracked several rats that had migrated to other colonies, bringing their local strain of leptospirosis with them. That could mean common disruptions to rat populations, including construction, may lead to “intermingling of rat populations” and increased, not decreased, leptospirosis spread, Rosenbaum said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We need to start shifting our approach from, ‘Let’s try and kill them and eradicate them,’ to better understanding how to coexist with them. We’re not ever going to eradicate them,” Rosenbaum said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Wagner said he hopes the study, which was published in the Public Library of Science of Neglected Tropical Diseases, will help the public appreciate that the disease is becoming more prevalent worldwide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s something we should be keeping an eye on,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Barnum, American showman and circus master, famously said, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or did he?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/there-is-no-such-thing-as-bad-publicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no definitive evidence&lt;/a&gt; that Barnum was the actual source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But why did we ask? Well, that just came naturally to us, two old medical academics.  Thanks to our training and our work as writers, researchers, and teachers, we know that it is good to think twice about claims and their veracity. This matters less when the stakes are low, like the P.T. Barnum quip, but it matters a lot when the stakes are high — for example, important health policy claims that might affect millions of people, such as those in the recent &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/maha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MAHA Report&lt;/a&gt;. Citations bolster research reliability because they put claims in the context of prior work and facilitate verification by pointing to sources. And AI agrees. When we asked CoPilot “Do citations matter in writing about science?” it said, yes, “they’re the backbone of academic integrity—without them, science wouldn’t progress in a structured, credible way!” Of course, asking AI is hardly the ideal way to check citations (spoiler alert).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our little academic world, being cited is gratifying. It means someone actually read something we wrote, found it useful, and chose to build on it. So, we were both intrigued learning that two of our papers were cited in the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/maha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MAHA report&lt;/a&gt;. Being cited in a major government publication is not just recognition, it’s also publicity. But in this case, not good publicity. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, both of us received calls from journalists about citations in the MAHA report. Kravitz was asked if he knew about a publication cited in the MAHA report (footnote No. 520) meant to support the claim that “more studies on direct-to-consumer television advertisements are directed to adults” than to children. The problem was that the cited paper did not exist. But the clever journalist was able to trace the phony citation to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11056603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;real paper&lt;/a&gt; Kravitz wrote years before. The citation (since corrected) was supposedly published in the Lancet, a prestigious medical journal whose editorial gates Kravitz long aspired to breech. But it wasn’t. Worse, from the standpoint of ego (always an issue in academia), the paper was attributed to a different author. Most importantly, it did not directly address the claim it was used to corroborate.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Woloshin got a call from a journalist inquiring about his New England Journal of Medicine article, cited in the MAHA report (No. 519). The journalist asked if it was ironic that the report cited a journal Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  recently &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/rfk-jr-says-medical-journals-corrupt-so-nih-may-publish-in-house/"&gt;trashed&lt;/a&gt; as unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course it was ironic. But it was also wrong. The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16597175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; was published in a different (alas, less prestigious) journal in a different year and, most importantly, on the wrong subject. The citation, used to substantiate a claim about TV drug ads, was actually about print journalists’ coverage of disease awareness campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These errors were just two among many cited by the nonprofit outlet &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NOTUS&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the MAHA report cited a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-4146" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; about Texas children covered by Medicaid but used it to support a claim about all 50 states. Another claim, that stopping “antidepressants, stimulants, antipsychotics, and other psychiatric drugs … often leads to disabling and pronged physical dependence … and withdrawal,” was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36513909/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not supported by its citation&lt;/a&gt;, a review only about antidepressants and not focused on children. Four other citations were to &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/may/30/MAHA-report-AI-fake-citations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nonexistent papers&lt;/a&gt;. Some believe these errors occurred because MAHA report authors may have relied on an AI agent to find citations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized these (and other) errors in the Report as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTmFjM-T85w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“some [minor] formatting issues.” &lt;/a&gt; But that is wrong. This is sloppy work which undermines faith in the whole report. A government report meant to influence the lives of millions of Americans should be thoroughly vetted and based on the most reliable sources. The government has reissued the report, but problems remain: The citation to Kravitz has been partially corrected, while Woloshin’s is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientific and technological successes of the past century come in part from a culture that respects prior work and endeavors to get the facts right. The process isn’t perfect. As we and others have noted, scientific integrity remains under threat from predatory journals, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Kravitz-2/publication/43131813_Editorial_Peer_Reviewers'_Recommendations_at_a_General_Medical_Journal_Are_They_Reliable_and_Do_Editors_Care/links/09e415134d695c3e8b000000/Editorial-Peer-Reviewers-Recommendatio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;porous peer review&lt;/a&gt;, poor results reproducibility, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199907223410411" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; scientific crimes and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1702463/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;misdemeanors&lt;/a&gt;. But it is undeniable that journals have made great progress in the last decades — for example, by creating standards for conflict of interest disclosure, pre-registration of randomized trial protocols (to prevent changing methods and outcomes after the fact), and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199907223410411" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt; papers &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2821293" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;critical &lt;/a&gt;of the journals when their efforts fall short.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In contrast, given the Trump administration’s recent actions — such as agency closures, grant cancellations, and layoffs of technical experts — the errors in the MAHA report reinforce serious concerns about its dedication to rigorous inquiry and factual accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How could the MAHA authors have done better? &lt;a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/WAa5Ew9Cz64HDPoiqVktK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;We asked AI&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have to write a report to outline the leading drivers of childhood disease. Please suggest some basic principles for if and how to use and cite the research literature.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI was happy to oblige.  Here are the top 3 “key principles for using and citing research literature in your report:”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. “Prioritize studies from reputable journals to ensure accuracy and credibility in your report.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2. “Reference original studies directly rather than relying on summaries or secondary interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3. “Select literature that directly applies to childhood disease to maintain focus and avoid misrepresenation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post ended with general advice and an offer of help:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This concise approach keeps the most important guidelines front and center while ensuring your report maintains integrity.  Would you like help incorporating these principles into a draft section of your report?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great answer. And funny. But also, given the stakes, very sad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steven Woloshin, M.D., M.S., is professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine’s Dartmouth Institute. He is an unpaid member of the editorial boards of JAMA Internal Medicine and the International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication —&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the views expressed here are his own. Richard L. Kravitz, M.D., M.S.P.H., is a distinguished professor at the UC-Davis Department of Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The spread of this subvariant in other countries as well has raised concerns among the medical community and the general public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/20/550x309/photo-1599493758267-c6c884c7071f_1750403721329_1750403729835.jpg" alt="The Nimbus subvariant now represents 55% of Covid-19 cases in California, with wastewater surveillance indicating rising viral levels.(Unsplash)" title="The Nimbus subvariant now represents 55% of Covid-19 cases in California, with wastewater surveillance indicating rising viral levels.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/20/550x309/photo-1599493758267-c6c884c7071f_1750403721329_1750403729835.jpg" alt="The Nimbus subvariant now represents 55% of Covid-19 cases in California, with wastewater surveillance indicating rising viral levels.(Unsplash)" title="The Nimbus subvariant now represents 55% of Covid-19 cases in California, with wastewater surveillance indicating rising viral levels.(Unsplash)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;The Nimbus subvariant now represents 55% of Covid-19 cases in California, with wastewater surveillance indicating rising viral levels.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ| &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-we-know-about-covid-variant-nimbus-known-for-razor-blade-throat-amid-surge-in-cases-101750345984003.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="What we know about Covid variant ‘Nimbus’ known for ‘razor blade throat’ amid surge in cases"&gt;What we know about Covid variant ‘Nimbus’ known for ‘razor blade throat’ amid surge in cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is ‘Nimbus’?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this new subvariant is a part of the Omicron family and is now almost parallel in effect to that of the last most dominant subvariant: the LP 8.1. The nimbus is now responsible for 37% of all coronavirus samples detected. California has been under threat by this subvariant ever since May and now comprises 55% of cases detected in the state as per the state Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Before Omicron, I think most people presented with the usual loss of taste and smell as the predominant symptom and shortness of breath,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert to the LA Times. But due to the “razor blade throat” effect of the Nimbus subvariant, attention has now been diverted to “other aspects of these symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wastewater surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of coronavirus have been detected in the state’s wastewater as per noted professionals and may be contributing to the spike in cases. Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, wrote in an email to The Times, “Wastewater surveillance across Southern California shows variability: Santa Barbara watersheds are reporting moderate-to-high levels, Ventura and Los Angeles counties are seeing low-to-moderate levels, Riverside is reporting low levels, while San Bernardino is experiencing high activity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health says that viral levels in wastewater have risen by 13% for the ten-day period concluded on May 30 which proves why more positive cases of the virus have started to appear in the city. As per its official website, coronavirus levels across California continue to remain at a “medium” scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in Santa Clara County have started to rise over the summer while the levels in the sewershed of San José are considered to be high. Palo Alto records “medium” levels and Sunnyvale reports “low”. San Francisco, on the other hand, still has a relatively lower number of cases being reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ|&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/what-is-razor-blade-throat-new-covid-variant-nimbus-in-us-causing-very-painful-symptom-know-about-prevention-101750240798218.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="What is razor blade throat?

&lt;span class="lead_post_detail row"&gt;
Experts recommend incorporating specific foods—such as turmeric, lime, apple cider vinegar, green tea, and papaya—into daily meals to support liver health.	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class="fck_detail"&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to Dr. Nguyen Anh Tuan, Head of the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery at Central Military Hospital 108, the liver is considered fatty when fat accounts for more than 5–10% of its total weight. This buildup makes the liver more prone to damage and can lead to inflammation, fibrosis, or even liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Tuan emphasized that dietary and lifestyle changes can significantly improve the condition. Here are six foods known to support liver recovery:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Turmeric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/9-best-herbs-for-liver-health-4894207.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/a&gt; helps prevent fat buildup in the liver by boosting fat metabolism and reducing accumulated fat content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="A close up shot of turmeric powder.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Limes are rich in vitamin C, a natural antioxidant that boosts the liver’s production of glutathione, a key compound for detoxification. They also contain naringenin, which has been shown to reduce liver inflammation due to fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Apple cider vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Widely regarded as a natural remedy for fatty liver, &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/7-drinks-to-detox-liver-4891809.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;apple cider vinegar&lt;/a&gt; may aid in weight loss and help reduce fat storage in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Green tea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/3-best-herbal-teas-to-support-kidney-health-4897201.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt;, rich in antioxidants and essential nutrients, supports fat burning and may help reduce the risk of fatty liver disease, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Dandelion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dandelion is traditionally used as a liver tonic. It supports fat breakdown and helps activate liver function, making it particularly effective for individuals with NAFLD related to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Papaya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Papaya and its seeds are believed to aid in healing liver damage, including fibrosis. The fruit helps burn fat in the liver and is considered beneficial for managing fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Tuan advises patients to monitor their weight and limit fat intake to reduce liver fat levels. For those who are overweight or obese, gradual weight loss is key to improving liver function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4903033,4899210,4894666,4903513,4898192,4897201" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dementia is a degenerative brain condition leading to diminished cognitive abilities, encompassing memory and rational skills, as well as speech and emotional response over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 944,000 individuals in the UK are afflicted with dementia, with one in 11 people over 65 being affected. This figure is on the rise due to increased longevity amongst the population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although an absolute cure remains elusive, prompt diagnosis of dementia is imperative to establish a treatment regime and medications to manage symptoms more effectively. Dr Johannes Uys of Broadgate General Practice pinpointed several precursory indicators that might suggest the advent of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While dementia is commonly associated with failing memory, Dr Uys indicates that physical symptoms may precede memory deterioration in certain cases. He identifies four initial signs to be vigilant about, often connected to specific dementia types like Parkinson's disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The specialist further stressed that the manifestation of symptoms is individual, considering each person's unique experience with dementia. "However, if you notice any of these early signs in yourself or a loved one, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. Early detection and intervention can help manage symptoms and provide the necessary support", he concluded, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/four-early-signs-dementia-appear-30272065" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia risk factors are a mixed bag, with some being unavoidable like age, while others can be managed through lifestyle modifications in our younger years. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are known to lower the risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other beneficial changes include maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption and cholesterol levels. The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; suggests that cutting down on saturated fats, salt, and sugar, and increasing fibre intake could also help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The GP went on to share these four early signs to look out for:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;an unsteady gait&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;clumsiness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;difficulty with coordination&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;tremors or stiffness in the limbs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of dementia allows for prompt support to patients. However, a recent Alzheimer's Society survey reveals that only one in three people consult a doctor within the first month of noticing dementia symptoms in themselves or a loved one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A poll involving 1,100 individuals showed that most people hesitate to seek help due to uncertainty about whether the symptoms are related to the condition or just signs of ageing. It's crucial to remember that dementia is not a natural part of ageing, and if you're becoming increasingly forgetful, especially if you're over 65, it's advisable to consult your GP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts predict that by 2050, a staggering 150 million people worldwide will be affected by the condition, according to research published in the Lancet Public Health. Currently, around 900,000 people in the UK are living with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 06:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcUhRS1ZLSk9WNlNRZmRjQWJUWXlQVDNIOHBvOHZodjh2Z0ZLaGtWV0pFQTBRcHJaZ0hPRnp6NEt3ZHFtQUxVT0NuOHREWGhtY3VRU0VybzFKY1ZJODdIVjVDLUV3bEpEYTdBYWVXU2dmV0sySEQ3T25nODJRQ3VjaGpqYTdCYWZn0gGOAUFVX3lxTE54LTN5dWd1cXpqcjdFcDRCQzJhbGQzMm9Vdkp3N3JwVGYyeWhnZmt6emdEd25lSjYzUERLQ1B0dFFsbHNUVFplU1pkTmZLUkNPSVZ0OWN6MWhqOVVoTlFIdzEybThmVVVrejVaaXJhZU9Ba216aS1HRWtIVE8tUTNfLUFtNXBEVGp4ZUVOb2c</guid></item><item><title>通过简单的血液测试，可以在症状出现前3年检测到癌症；新研究显示-印度时报 | Cancer could be detected 3 years before symptoms appear with a simple blood test; new study reveals - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAJBVV95cUxOM0psN09ldWJ5YXNfSjBXZmpuaUFsQnlLUFZRQXV5VVRqYzI3cURlbGFaWXFtTGF6RXQ2YUctZTh3QTFCWmVseHg2cUdGeFVTbmFlNWNHZXdTTV9GRldybGRST2NodzJteFlKMkNhcnEyUV95X0RuNjBhR0N5eVBQSEJ3QU1iUExKbm5HUHdqM0lCdmJyb3JQSmV5VUxabmdudDQ4WkJaS010Vl9fLWg5U0dpSXF6RThwXzBHSjFmNlo4X19UY2dBSGJkeU4xU1F2NG5QQ3BNYlhTazZudWRZOVZ1Y2NYOERyeHZQNXd1bnVhVlRiaTFwNGVBY3dGRFp6dkFXZEI0MnQtVVkyaUVMZDZyYVdGem5HSm5zM25tVFRGb1dp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the leading causes of death in recent years, cancer, is claiming to take millions of lives each year. Despite the significant advancements in the treatment, the biggest challenge in fighting cancer is that the detection is often too late. Detecting cancer earlier may dramatically improve survival rates and offer more treatment options. But, this is yet harder to diagnose at the earliest stage and is one of the crucial reasons for rising deaths worldwide. Now, a new study by Johns Hopkins University researchers suggests that a simple blood test could help identify cancer years before symptoms even begin to show, potentially transforming the future of early diagnosis and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375/762609/Detection-of-cancers-three-years-prior-to" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, this breakthrough might be a push in early diagnosis of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A simple blood test may detect cancer early, before any symptoms start&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer outcomes are heavily dependent on how early the disease is detected. When tumours are caught in their initial stages, they tend to be smaller, less aggressive, and more responsive to treatment. As researcher Yuxuan Wang from Johns Hopkins explains, “Three years earlier provides time for intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumours are likely to be much less advanced and more likely to be curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time advantage could make the difference between curable and life-threatening cancer, especially in aggressive forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the research is a type of genetic material called circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Tumours naturally shed fragments of their DNA into the bloodstream, but these traces are extremely minute and hard to detect, especially in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Science behind detecting cancer in blood&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify these fragments, scientists used multi-step algorithms and cross-checks to scan blood samples for modifications in DNA patterns that are commonly linked to tumours. The technique forms the basis of a Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) test, designed to look for cancer-specific genetic changes in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analysed blood samples from 52 individuals, split into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26 people who were later diagnosed with cancer within six months of sample collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26 people who remained cancer-free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When subjected to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/multi-cancer-early-detection-tests.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MCED test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, eight cancer cases were flagged, indicating a 31% detection rate. While not perfect, this detection occurred before any formal diagnosis or visible symptoms appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Testing the method: What the study revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the findings even more groundbreaking is the analysis of older blood samples from some of the participants. Six of the eight individuals who were detected by the MCED test had blood samples available from 3.1 to 3.5 years before their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, cancer signals were found in four of those six samples. The ctDNA was present, although at levels up to 80 times lower than what the current test threshold requires. This suggests that tumours begin shedding DNA into the blood long before symptoms arise. if the tests are sensitive enough, these early signs could be caught. While the results are promising, they also highlight a key hurdle that the current technology needs to improve its sensitivity. The earlier the stage of cancer, the lower the ctDNA levels, making detection difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows the promise of MCED tests in detecting cancers very early,” says Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a senior cancer researcher involved in the project. “But it also sets the benchmark sensitivities required for these tests to succeed.” In simpler terms, we now know what we should aim for—but we’re not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happens after a positive cancer blood test&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the science is encouraging, moving from lab to the clinic is not straightforward. Blood-based cancer screening tests must undergo rigorous clinical trials to prove their reliability and safety. Once proven effective, they still require regulatory approvals before being adopted into regular medical practice. There's also the question of what comes after a positive test. Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos from the Ludwig Centre notes, “We need to determine the appropriate clinical follow-up after a positive test result. That includes further scans, biopsies, or even preventive treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the current limitations, this research represents a hopeful shift in cancer diagnostics. Combined with ongoing advances in treatment, especially therapies targeting multiple cancer types, the future holds the potential for significantly improved survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This could mark a revolutionary step forward in how cancer is screened and treated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/10-common-monsoon-diseases-that-might-cause-serious-health-problems-know-symptoms-and-how-to-protect-yourself/articleshow/121928699.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;10 common monsoon diseases that might cause serious health problems; know symptoms and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 06:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAJBVV95cUxOM0psN09ldWJ5YXNfSjBXZmpuaUFsQnlLUFZRQXV5VVRqYzI3cURlbGFaWXFtTGF6RXQ2YUctZTh3QTFCWmVseHg2cUdGeFVTbmFlNWNHZXdTTV9GRldybGRST2NodzJteFlKMkNhcnEyUV95X0RuNjBhR0N5eVBQSEJ3QU1iUExKbm5HUHdqM0lCdmJyb3JQSmV5VUxabmdudDQ4WkJaS010Vl9fLWg5U0dpSXF6RThwXzBHSjFmNlo4X19UY2dBSGJkeU4xU1F2NG5QQ3BNYlhTazZudWRZOVZ1Y2NYOERyeHZQNXd1bnVhVlRiaTFwNGVBY3dGRFp6dkFXZEI0MnQtVVkyaUVMZDZyYVdGem5HSm5zM25tVFRGb1dp</guid></item><item><title>一项减肥策略比Ozempic更有效5倍，试验显示- ScienceAlert | One Weight Loss Strategy Is 5x More Effective Than Ozempic, Trials Show - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOWGt6dW1vUElucFRkb1Yxb3o5bF8wYUE3Tkx3WXNPallDNnVxNkxCMnNVb2RpcFJLYkk2eUhMcFBmZ29XN3pmakRENlBBeUJBSV9qRTRqb3A3Ym9qMHBqRllpamcxQWJpVlpkRTNLclJNRWgxRWlSZUlndXgxOUhGbDJ4akM0WmNkS0JjdnFxSW9xdGFLREVUd3RvWnk4MlE3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

These drugs are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1) receptor agonists, because of the way they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-reshapes-the-kinds-of-food-people-eat-heres-what-happens"&gt;controls appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using health records, the team matched people who had taken one of the weight loss drugs with people who had undergone either of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; operations, based on age, body mass index, and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg" alt="Ozempic Isn't Actually The Most Effective Option For Weight Loss, Scientists Confirm" class="wp-image-165321 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(aprott/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: people in the surgery group shed an average of 25.7 percent of their total body weight over two years, while those in the medication group lost 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's partly down to patients not sticking to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;their GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;, whereas surgery is more permanent, but the researchers also noticed smaller differences over shorter time frames – the surgery always gave the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; show weight loss between 15 percent to 21 percent for GLP-1s, but this study suggests that weight loss in the real world is considerably lower even for patients who have active prescriptions for an entire year," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Avery Brown, a surgical resident at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know as many as 70 percent of patients may discontinue treatment within one year. GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting, however, that the study was funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), who would have a vested interest in promoting surgical options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the researchers aren't outright dismissing semaglutide treatments, which also showed beneficial results in this study. With &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions doubling&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 to 2023, it's crucial to investigate how they compare to established &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/as-well-as-weight-loss-studies-find-bariatric-surgery-also-lowers-the-risk-of-developing-cancer"&gt;surgery methods&lt;/a&gt;, and to figure out which options are best for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs remain much more popular than surgery, but people &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349"&gt;don't often&lt;/a&gt; stick to taking them. Meanwhile, only a small percentage of people eligible for surgery choose it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss isn't the only benefit that can come from Ozempic. The drug was originally approved as a way to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="165259" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, because it helps lower blood sugar levels, and studies have shown it can also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-and-similar-drugs-lower-cancer-risks-study-suggests"&gt;the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, bariatric surgery was associated with even better blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that surgery isn't a silver bullet either. Though safe, the procedures are invasive, permanent, and still require patients to stick to strict diet and exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future studies we will aim to identify what healthcare providers can do to optimize GLP-1 outcomes, identify which patients are better treated with bariatric surgery versus GLP-1s, and determine the role out-of-pocket costs play in treatment success," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2025.04.008"&gt;was presented&lt;/a&gt; at the ASMBS annual meeting 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers analyzed findings from 133 reviews that included over 258,000 participants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The benefits were especially noticeable for children, adolescents, and people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/adhd-overview-7187317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD), Singh told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.

However, longer interventions were helpful for other aspects of brain health, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity type. &lt;/strong&gt;Exergames—video games that require physical movement—had the biggest effects on cognition and memory. Yoga, Tai Chi, or other exercises that require people to remember coordinated movement sequences were also particularly beneficial for memory.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, this is yet another piece of evidence that &lt;strong&gt;moving more is good for your brain—and yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames could be especially effective ways to do it.&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s what to know about each type of exercise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ​&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/yoga-8715089" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; is an ancient practice that combines &lt;strong&gt;physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation,&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.drannaemanuel.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anna Emanuel, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative and functional medicine physician, yoga teacher, and founder of Love.Life Medical. This combination creates unique cognitive engagement that can improve brain health, Singh explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yoga can help &lt;strong&gt;reduce stress and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/inflammation-7480642" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; in turn supporting “hippocampal function, the brain’s center for memory,” he said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It also strengthens the prefrontal cortex, the brain region responsible for decision-making, planning, and emotional regulation,” Singh said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what’s the best way to get started with yoga (and reap its brain health benefits)? Start with &lt;strong&gt;short sessions—maybe 20 to 30 minutes, two or three times a week,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ascendantny.com/contributors/michael-genovese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Michael Genovese, MD, JD&lt;/a&gt;, physician and chief medical advisor at Ascendant New York, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try styles such as &lt;strong&gt;Hatha or Vinyasa yoga, &lt;/strong&gt;which blend gentle movement with breathwork, Genovese recommended.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/stress-management-8551051" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress reduction&lt;/a&gt; is good for your brain, end each yoga session with meditation or a relaxation technique, added Singh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Following structured yoga programs specifically designed for brain health or mindfulness can further amplify the cognitive benefits,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/tai-chi-memory-parkinsons-disease-8407135" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tai Chi&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional Chinese martial art that &lt;strong&gt;combines slow movements and deep breathing&lt;/strong&gt; to intentionally balance energy through the body, Emauel told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Often described as ‘moving meditation,’ the sequence of movements aim to slow down the mind, body, and breath,” she explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tai Chi promotes cognitive health more effectively than other exercises because it focuses on &lt;strong&gt;slow, purposeful movements that connect the body and mind,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.comprehendthemind.com/team/dr-sanam-hafeez" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sanam Hafeez, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist and director of Comprehend the Mind, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. This “activates brain regions responsible for &lt;strong&gt;memory and motor functions&lt;/strong&gt;,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who practice Tai Chi also have to &lt;strong&gt;remember a specific set of movements,&lt;/strong&gt; which challenges memory, added Genovese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And like yoga, the practice “&lt;strong&gt;lowers stress,&lt;/strong&gt; which usually means better focus and mental clarity,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the greatest cognitive benefits, practice Tai Chi at least &lt;strong&gt;three times per week for 20 to 60 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; per session, Singh said, ideally with a group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Engaging in structured routines, such as the Yang or Chen styles, can be particularly effective, as they require memorization,” he said. “Focusing on controlled breathing and mindfulness during practice further enhances cognitive engagement.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exergames are &lt;strong&gt;video games that require physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; to interact with the game, making exercise both engaging and cognitively stimulating, Singh explained.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Per Singh, examples include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Wii Sports,&lt;/strong&gt; which features games such as tennis and boxing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dance Dance Revolution,&lt;/strong&gt; a step-based rhythm game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual reality fitness games,&lt;/strong&gt; including Beat Saber, Supernatural, and FitXR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You are reacting quickly, following patterns, and solving challenges—all while physically active,” Genovese said. “This kind of multitasking can &lt;strong&gt;help sharpen attention, coordination, and memory.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On top of that, the highly interactive and gamified nature of exergames &lt;strong&gt;keeps you motivated,&lt;/strong&gt; leading to more consistent participation and cognitive benefits over time, Singh explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To maximize cognitive benefits, choose exergames that involve complex movements and decision-making, like &lt;strong&gt;rhythm-based or sports simulation games,&lt;/strong&gt; Singh said. Play for at least &lt;strong&gt;20 to 30 minutes, three to five times per week.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only should you pick games that challenge you mentally and physically, but you should also pick ones you find fun. “The more you enjoy it, the more likely you are to stick with it—and that is where the real benefits come in,” Genovese said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(&lt;a href="http://www.wsfa.com" target="_self" rel="" title="http://www.wsfa.com"&gt;WSFA&lt;/a&gt;) - A cancer diagnosis, especially one that is late-stage, can shake a family to its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;For a Millbrook couple, it’s not one diagnosis. It’s two. And they got the news within days of each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Wendy Wilson says this isn’t her first battle with cancer.

Her husband, Kevin, is now fighting a similar battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“He was told that he has stage four prostate cancer, and then, within a week later, I was told that my breast cancer had come back for a second time, and it is also stage four, because it had spread to other areas of my body,” Wilson explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Wilson is staring cancer in the face with bravery and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“To be honest, it’s my kids; I’m not done seeing them grow,” she said. “I’m not done seeing them graduate high school, or continue the legacy of us, so, that’s my strength: showing them that no matter what you’re faced with, you have to meet it head on and do the best you can, and if you can’t you’re going to go down fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Her daughter, Savannah, will be leaving for basic training in the military this summer. She hopes in her absence, the community will show her parents love and support as they battle cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“They need everything that they can get right now,” Savannah Wilson said. “They definitely do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;She urges people not to take a minute with loved ones for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Anything can turn bad quickly,” she said. “No matter what you have going on, always check on your family and your loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The family is asking for prayers and support and has created a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/one-marriage-two-stage-4-cancer-diagnoses-just-one-week-ap?attribution_id=sl:1e5ed4ab-40c9-43a8-bfc5-83a83213ec56&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/one-marriage-two-stage-4-cancer-diagnoses-just-one-week-ap?attribution_id=sl:1e5ed4ab-40c9-43a8-bfc5-83a83213ec56&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page to help with medical costs not covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Wendy Wilson stresses the importance of staying up-to-date on your screenings so you can catch cancer in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not reading this story on the WSFA News App?

Dr Joseph Salhab, a gastroenterologist and 'expert in digestion, liver, pancreas and nutrition', in a video shared on Instagram on June 19, listed the top 3 symptoms one should look out for to know they have fatty liver or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Top 3 symptoms of fatty liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the three symptoms in his video, Dr Salhab said, “Three symptoms of a fatty &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-shares-7-refreshing-drinks-that-support-liver-health-and-reduce-inflammation-101750344689692.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="liver"&gt;liver &lt;/a&gt;that you should know, with the last one being the most common symptom.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the gastroenterologist, the first sign of a fatty liver is fatigue. He pointed out that it is probably one of the most commonly reported symptoms in people with a fatty liver. “We think it's related to metabolic dysfunction of the liver and sleep disturbances that can occur in fatty liver disease,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Pain in the upper belly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Dr Salhab, another symptom of fatty liver is pain in the right upper quadrant of your belly. “This can happen at random times during the day or after you eat, and sometimes it can indicate active inflammation of the liver,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. No signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the gastroenterologist, the number one and most common symptom of a fatty liver is absolutely nothing. “In fact, most people with fatty liver have no signs and no symptoms. Fatty liver is a sneaky disease because 50 percent of people who have a fatty liver can even have normal lab tests,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist further added, “The reason why the top symptom is concerning is because it hides the fact that you have silent inflammation, and then if liver failure eventually occurs, you finally start showing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nimbus variant, officially designated NB.1.8.1, now accounts for 37% of COVID infections in Americans, according to &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; data, double the rate from last month. Health experts expect it to become the dominant strain by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The nickname is razor blade. It's a razor blade COVID," said Dr. Ahmed Salem, a pulmonologist at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego. "It's not just [a] sore throat. I mean, people are saying it feels like glass is cutting them. So, you know, this is making people nervous when people hear that."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the alarming symptom, Salem stressed that patients should not panic. The variant appears to be less severe than previous strains.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, it's actually less virulent so far. We're not seeing an increased mortality or increased death," Salem said. "Of course, it's not a great symptom to have, but we're not seeing increased death from it."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;/a&gt;has designated Nimbus as a "variant under monitoring" due to its rapid increase in case proportions, though overall COVID cases remain down compared to last year, both nationally and in &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/respiratoryviruses/surveillance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;San Diego County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thankfully, in the hospital and in the ICU, we're not seeing a lot of patients who are hospitalized with COVID," Salem said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variant carries typical COVID symptoms including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath and loss of taste or smell, in addition to the severe throat pain. The sore throat typically lasts about a week.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For treatment, Salem recommends standard sore throat remedies: salt water gargles, lozenges, lidocaine sprays, rest and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current COVID vaccines remain effective against the Nimbus variant, according to health experts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The data and experts in the field are saying it should be the COVID vaccine should be effective for this variant," Salem said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials recommend that people who test positive should isolate until fever-free for 24 hours, then mask and take precautions for five additional days. Those exposed to COVID should test on days one, three and five after exposure while masking and monitoring for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem emphasized that basic prevention measures remain key: frequent hand washing, good hygiene, wearing masks and avoiding contact with immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

While factors like age, diet, exercise, weight and alcohol intake play a role, diet also has a meaningful impact. In particular, diets low in fiber and high in animal protein, fat and refined carbs have been linked to increased colorectal cancer rates. The good news? Improving your diet doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. In fact, there are several &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pantry-items-that-are-always-in-my-shopping-cart-8657993" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:canned foods you can keep in your pantry;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;canned foods you can keep in your pantry&lt;/a&gt; to help reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People often think eating for health means getting super creative in the kitchen or spending lots of time slicing and dicing—but it does not have to be that way. Canned foods can go from can to table in minutes, and they still deliver big on nutrition,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lizshealthytable.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Liz Weiss, MS, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Liz Weiss, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. So which canned foods should you stock up on? &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinaiconciergecare.org/maria-fraga-rd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maria Elena Fraga, RD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maria Elena Fraga, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, recommends focusing on options that are packed with fiber and antioxidants and low in sodium. Here are the top five canned foods to help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Canned Legumes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned legumes—including beans, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lentils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; and peas—are Weiss’s top recommendation. In addition to being budget-friendly and easy-to-use, legumes are rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and fiber, both of which may help protect against cancer. One review found intake of both &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:soluble and insoluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; was linked with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiss notes that canned legumes provide 6-8 grams of fiber per one-half cup serving, “which goes a long way toward the 25 grams per day recommended for women and 38 grams for men that most Americans fall short of,” she adds. Weiss suggests adding canned lentils to pasta sauce, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7939867/creamy-white-bean-soup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pureeing white beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;pureeing white beans&lt;/a&gt; for “cream-less” soups, tossing soybeans into grain bowls or drizzling canned peas with olive oil and a pinch of salt for a no-fuss side. “[Canned] pulses are shelf-stable, versatile, colorful and ready to eat in minutes—no soaking or long cooking times required,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Canned Artichokes Hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned artichoke hearts are rich in fiber, providing 5 grams per 1/2 cup, and some of that fiber is from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7834565/what-is-inulin-and-what-should-i-eat-to-get-more-of-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inulin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;—a prebiotic fiber.  &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prebiotic fibers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prebiotic fibers&lt;/a&gt; play an essential role in gut health by providing food for good bacteria to thrive. This contributes to a diverse and healthy microbiome, which may reduce the risk of colon cancer. Artichoke hearts also contain plant-based polyphenols—antioxidants that can reduce inflammation. Weiss likes to toss &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-spring-artichoke-recipes-8652950" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:canned artichoke hearts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;canned artichoke hearts&lt;/a&gt; into salads and whole grain pasta dishes for an easy flavor- and fiber-boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Canned Pumpkin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin is another canned food item rich in fiber, providing 3.5 grams in per 1/2 cup. It also contains beta-carotene, a carotenoid that gives the gourd its bright orange color and gets converted into &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;—an essential nutrient that supports a healthy immune system. While more research is needed, certain carotenoids, including beta-carotene, have been linked with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Weiss suggests adding a few spoonfuls of &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-canned-pumpkin-puree-taste-test-8730790" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:canned pumpkin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;canned pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; to smoothies, oatmeal or yogurt (along with some warming spices) for a fall-flavored breakfast or snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Canned Soups with Whole Grains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is strong evidence that whole grains help to lower colorectal cancer risk,” says Weiss. For a simple lunch or dinner option, she recommends keeping a few cans of whole grain-containing soups in your cupboard. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252413/bean-barley-soup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:barley;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt; is frequently found in soups, several brands offer varieties featuring other whole grains, like quinoa, brown rice, wild rice or farro. Especially if you have high blood pressure, look for canned soups that are labeled “low-sodium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Canned Oranges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-lower-colon-cancer-risk-11716524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Foods that contain vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Foods that contain vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Weiss notes that while the evidence is more limited, “vitamin C (an antioxidant) can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—two key drivers in cancer development.” One review found that higher intakes of citrus fruits, apples, watermelon and kiwi were associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. When shopping for canned oranges, look for options packed in their own juices, rather than syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-tomatoes-good-for-you-8636976" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tomatoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are another food that’s high in vitamin C, as well as a potent antioxidant called lycopene. Test tube studies suggest tomatoes may have anticancer properties thanks to their lycopene content. However, research in humans is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Strategies to Help Reduce Your Risk of Colorectal Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to lowering your risk of colorectal cancer, there are several ways you can adjust your lifestyle to help. Here are a few key strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get Screened&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends that everyone begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45. However, if you have risk factors for colorectal cancer—such as a family history of the disease or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/inflammation-colon-cancer-study-8761229" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammatory bowel conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammatory bowel conditions&lt;/a&gt;—you may need to start screening earlier. Be sure to discuss your personal risk and the best screening plan with a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move More&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity is linked to an increased risk of both colorectal cancer and obesity—a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer. Luckily, staying active benefits your health and can genuinely be &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:enjoyable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;. Exercising with a friend or taking your sweat session outdoors can boost motivation even more, as social support and time in nature may enhance feelings of joy and purpose. Tyring going for a walk or hike or participate in community programs like yoga, tennis or pickleball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cut Back on Red and Processed Meat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong evidence shows that consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:red and processed meats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt; is linked with an increased risk of colon and rectal cancer. To reduce your risk, it’s recommended to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meats-and-cancer-11728821" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid processed meats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avoid processed meats&lt;/a&gt; and consume less than 12 ounces of unprocessed red meat per week. Fraga also cautions against eating canned meats, like corned beef and Spam, as they’re heavily processed and typically high in saturated fat. Instead, aim to consume more plant-based proteins, like beans, lentils and tofu. These foods are typically high in fiber and contain anti-inflammatory compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid Excessive Alcohol Intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drink alcohol in moderation if at all,” Weiss says. If you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-8747903" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, limit your intake to no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 per day for men. Reduce your intake of alcoholic beverages by drinking water between alcoholic drinks or swap them for non-alcoholic versions or low-sugar mocktails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Boost Fiber Intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes are nutrient-dense, providing ample amounts of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Diets rich in fiber are associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. “Fiber keeps foods moving through the GI tract and feeds the beneficial gut bacteria that produce protective compounds like butyrate,” explains Weiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-start-now-to-reduce-your-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-11748558" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Increase your fiber intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Increase your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; by adding colorful fruits and vegetables to each meal, swapping refined grains for whole grains, snacking on nuts and seeds and incorporating legumes into your entrees. Just remember: when increasing fiber intake, increase your fluid intake simultaneously to reduce gas and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer is by eating a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-your-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-11721769" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt;. To help save money and time, dietitians recommend stocking up on certain canned foods, including legumes, oranges, pumpkin, artichoke hearts and soups with whole grains. In addition to prioritizing fiber, it’s also important to stay physically active, consume alcohol in moderation (if at all), cut back on unprocessed red meat and avoid processed meats. To stay on top of your health, talk with a healthcare professional about your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-11697620" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk for colorectal cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk for colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and when to get screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-canned-foods-to-reduce-your-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-11756128" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 01:33:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1VY2czX0VCQ2RsU2VCYk1kSTVrcF9xT0dPNVFNUE1tS0pBaVVVUzh6ZFNEV3BlT05xTXJldm5ZZ1MxaWNHQWp2Y1RpMl9xZjJ4eGFHdTdkbVI2bnBKQUExamhEMTI0Yl9Hcy1MRWRR</guid></item><item><title>大麻与心脏病发作和中风的联系正变得越来越清晰-《西雅图时报》 | Marijuana’s links to heart attack and stroke are becoming clearer - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOc3hEdEdUeTk0dUN6OUc5dVFLQlRaVi1XYzh5Sk9Cb3pRNm91YWZCaEd1TEJ6dlJyUGJsMkUxQ2d2dlo3a2l0QVl1dXBidXZoNi1kX3dkZlVSWHRaOTlyNGFiWkEwYnQ4Rl9wUXhaNEhlTDJKTGJ0VFBEbFE1ZWQ0a2RUXzBUTE9oRFpPWFdoZ3Vxcmh0VFJaWVFKeHRoOTkxd0Fxb01GUnlmSFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOc3hEdEdUeTk0dUN6OUc5dVFLQlRaVi1XYzh5Sk9Cb3pRNm91YWZCaEd1TEJ6dlJyUGJsMkUxQ2d2dlo3a2l0QVl1dXBidXZoNi1kX3dkZlVSWHRaOTlyNGFiWkEwYnQ4Rl9wUXhaNEhlTDJKTGJ0VFBEbFE1ZWQ0a2RUXzBUTE9oRFpPWFdoZ3Vxcmh0VFJaWVFKeHRoOTkxd0Fxb01GUnlmSFk?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Marijuana’s links to heart attack and stroke are becoming clearer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2pleXNtdERoRzI4VkdqX2l6OGN5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 00:29:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOc3hEdEdUeTk0dUN6OUc5dVFLQlRaVi1XYzh5Sk9Cb3pRNm91YWZCaEd1TEJ6dlJyUGJsMkUxQ2d2dlo3a2l0QVl1dXBidXZoNi1kX3dkZlVSWHRaOTlyNGFiWkEwYnQ4Rl9wUXhaNEhlTDJKTGJ0VFBEbFE1ZWQ0a2RUXzBUTE9oRFpPWFdoZ3Vxcmh0VFJaWVFKeHRoOTkxd0Fxb01GUnlmSFk</guid></item><item><title>医生忽视患者危及生命的中风导致可怕的“锁定”综合症： “完全可以避免” -纽约邮报 | Patient’s life-threatening stroke overlooked by doctors leads to horrific ‘locked-in’ syndrome: ‘Completely avoidable’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOUDF3Z19hQzV0SUg4TXhicjJhRVlueUhBZmdCZVRIWDdpQVEydURVVmtlTjk0bVpndDI3NW9VcHk4b2FMamlNMU0yZ1ZMSGtoeVNhVktRQUgtUlVqNU1yU3c0aGktNUtMamJFSlRZeXlCQkFpMWtHNzlWc3VfbTk3SXdLNXVHLUdsWi1McGV3Zmw0WFVSNVZ6U2lqZkJsNGhnMUVDRzM1SzlEb3d3aUdweUU5cjRYdkQzVE4yNFdMY1luZjhrdWdrWXVidGhFMVhXQ3hZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A young man is now locked in a nightmare after his livelihood was stolen by negligent doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Buckelew, 34, has been awarded a staggering $75 million in damages after multiple physicians failed to diagnose his life-threatening stroke, leaving him paralyzed from head to toe for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jonathan was rushed to North Fulton Hospital on October 26, 2015, after falling unconscious during a chiropractic neck adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jonathan Buckelew in 2011, four years before a tragic mistake that left him with locked-in syndrome. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Janice Buckelew/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the emergency response, almost every physician who came into contact failed to clock Jonathan’s stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lackadaisical care led the patient in his mid-20s to develop horrific locked-in syndrome, leaving him unable to move or talk despite having full consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“This case is heartbreaking because Jonathan’s paralysis and brain damage were completely avoidable,” said Jonathan’s attorney, Lloyd Bell, in a statement made following the Georgia Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold a verdict in their favor last March.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the slew of healthcare providers involved in Jonathan’s care would have acted according to the standard of care, caught and treated his stroke earlier, and communicated more effectively, Jonathan’s life would look entirely different.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jonathan Buckelew cannot move or speak on his own and requires round-the-clock medical care.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Janice Buckelew/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Buckelews sued the chiropractor, the hospital, Dr. Matthew Womack, radiologist James Waldschmidt, and neurologist Christopher Nickum for their failure to catch Jonathan’s stroke — the rapid treatment of which could have prevented his tragic outcome. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Fulton County state court found Womack and Waldschmidt guilty of malpractice, ordering the former to hand over $40 million. Jonathan was ultimately awarded $29 million in past and future medical expenses and $46 million for pain and suffering, per court documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jonathan is now restricted to communication through eye movements and a keypad that he manages to use with his nose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His parents, Jack and Janice, have turned their home into a 24-hour care center for their debilitated son.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I really feel like there’s no real justice for somebody who lost every aspect of his life,” Jack, &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/06/18/he-was-having-stroke-hours-er-doctors-missed-it/"&gt;told CBS affiliate Atlanta News First&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jonathan Buckelew’s doctors were charged with medical malpractice and his family was awarded $75 million in damages. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Janice Buckelew/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He wants to do things, he wants to go places — it just breaks our heart to see him like he is,” the desperate father continued.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“There are some days where he’s like ‘pull the plug,’ so those are the tough days.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jonathan’s counsel has blamed the hospital staff for not following standard procedure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jonathan Buckelew lives with his parents, who transformed their home into a care center for their debilitated son.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bell Law Firm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The ER doctor saw this patient was having all these signs and symptoms of stroke and never called a stroke alert, and they had policies in place that they were supposed to follow certain protocols to reach the correct diagnosis, and they didn’t follow their policies and procedures,” Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Womack has since filed another appeal with Georgia’s state supreme court after the first attempt was upheld in Jonathan’s favor. Waldschmidt, for his part, has withdrawn his attempt to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet has a major impact on your risk for colorectal cancer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canned foods that are high in fiber and antioxidants may help reduce your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes, pumpkin and artichoke hearts are among the best canned foods to help lower your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States, and its &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incidence is on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While factors like age, diet, exercise, weight and alcohol intake play a role, diet also has a meaningful impact. In particular, diets low in fiber and high in animal protein, fat and refined carbs have been linked to increased colorectal cancer rates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news? Improving your diet doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. In fact, there are several &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pantry-items-that-are-always-in-my-shopping-cart-8657993" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;canned foods you can keep in your pantry&lt;/a&gt; to help reduce your risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  “People often think eating for health means getting super creative in the kitchen or spending lots of time slicing and dicing—but it does not have to be that way. Canned foods can go from can to table in minutes, and they still deliver big on nutrition,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lizshealthytable.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Liz Weiss, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. So which canned foods should you stock up on? &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinaiconciergecare.org/maria-fraga-rd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maria Elena Fraga, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, recommends focusing on options that are packed with fiber and antioxidants and low in sodium. Here are the top five canned foods to help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-legumes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned legumes—including beans, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; and peas—are Weiss’s top recommendation. In addition to being budget-friendly and easy-to-use, legumes are rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and fiber, both of which may help protect against cancer. One review found intake of both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; was linked with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weiss notes that canned legumes provide 6-8 grams of fiber per one-half cup serving, “which goes a long way toward the 25 grams per day recommended for women and 38 grams for men that most Americans fall short of,” she adds. Weiss suggests adding canned lentils to pasta sauce, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7939867/creamy-white-bean-soup/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pureeing white beans&lt;/a&gt; for “cream-less” soups, tossing soybeans into grain bowls or drizzling canned peas with olive oil and a pinch of salt for a no-fuss side. “[Canned] pulses are shelf-stable, versatile, colorful and ready to eat in minutes—no soaking or long cooking times required,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-canned-artichokes-hearts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Canned Artichokes Hearts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned artichoke hearts are rich in fiber, providing 5 grams per 1/2 cup, and some of that fiber is from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7834565/what-is-inulin-and-what-should-i-eat-to-get-more-of-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;—a prebiotic fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Prebiotic fibers&lt;/a&gt; play an essential role in gut health by providing food for good bacteria to thrive. This contributes to a diverse and healthy microbiome, which may reduce the risk of colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Artichoke hearts also contain plant-based polyphenols—antioxidants that can reduce inflammation. Weiss likes to toss &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-spring-artichoke-recipes-8652950" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;canned artichoke hearts&lt;/a&gt; into salads and whole grain pasta dishes for an easy flavor- and fiber-boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-canned-pumpkin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Canned Pumpkin  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pumpkin is another canned food item rich in fiber, providing 3.5 grams in per 1/2 cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also contains beta-carotene, a carotenoid that gives the gourd its bright orange color and gets converted into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;—an essential nutrient that supports a healthy immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While more research is needed, certain carotenoids, including beta-carotene, have been linked with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Weiss suggests adding a few spoonfuls of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-canned-pumpkin-puree-taste-test-8730790" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;canned pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; to smoothies, oatmeal or yogurt (along with some warming spices) for a fall-flavored breakfast or snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-canned-soups-with-whole-grains"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Canned Soups with Whole Grains  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There is strong evidence that whole grains help to lower colorectal cancer risk,” says Weiss. For a simple lunch or dinner option, she recommends keeping a few cans of whole grain-containing soups in your cupboard. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252413/bean-barley-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt; is frequently found in soups, several brands offer varieties featuring other whole grains, like quinoa, brown rice, wild rice or farro. Especially if you have high blood pressure, look for canned soups that are labeled “low-sodium.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-canned-oranges"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Canned Oranges  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-lower-colon-cancer-risk-11716524" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Foods that contain vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Weiss notes that while the evidence is more limited, “vitamin C (an antioxidant) can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—two key drivers in cancer development.” One review found that higher intakes of citrus fruits, apples, watermelon and kiwi were associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When shopping for canned oranges, look for options packed in their own juices, rather than syrup.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to lowering your risk of colorectal cancer, there are several ways you can adjust your lifestyle to help. Here are a few key strategies: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Get Screened &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Cancer Society recommends that everyone begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you have risk factors for colorectal cancer—such as a family history of the disease or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/inflammation-colon-cancer-study-8761229" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammatory bowel conditions&lt;/a&gt;—you may need to start screening earlier. Be sure to discuss your personal risk and the best screening plan with a healthcare professional. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Move More  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Physical inactivity is linked to an increased risk of both colorectal cancer and obesity—a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, staying active benefits your health and can genuinely be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;. Exercising with a friend or taking your sweat session outdoors can boost motivation even more, as social support and time in nature may enhance feelings of joy and purpose. Tyring going for a walk or hike or participate in community programs like yoga, tennis or pickleball. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cut Back on Red and Processed Meat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strong evidence shows that consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt; is linked with an increased risk of colon and rectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To reduce your risk, it’s recommended to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meats-and-cancer-11728821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;avoid processed meats&lt;/a&gt; and consume less than 12 ounces of unprocessed red meat per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fraga also cautions against eating canned meats, like corned beef and Spam, as they’re heavily processed and typically high in saturated fat. Instead, aim to consume more plant-based proteins, like beans, lentils and tofu. These foods are typically high in fiber and contain anti-inflammatory compounds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Avoid Excessive Alcohol Intake  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drink alcohol in moderation if at all,” Weiss says. If you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-8747903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drink alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, limit your intake to no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 per day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Reduce your intake of alcoholic beverages by drinking water between alcoholic drinks or swap them for non-alcoholic versions or low-sugar mocktails. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Boost Fiber Intake  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes are nutrient-dense, providing ample amounts of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Diets rich in fiber are associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. “Fiber keeps foods moving through the GI tract and feeds the beneficial gut bacteria that produce protective compounds like butyrate,” explains Weiss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Just remember: when increasing fiber intake, increase your fluid intake simultaneously to reduce gas and bloating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer is by eating a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-your-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-11721769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt;. To help save money and time, dietitians recommend stocking up on certain canned foods, including legumes, oranges, pumpkin, artichoke hearts and soups with whole grains. In addition to prioritizing fiber, it’s also important to stay physically active, consume alcohol in moderation (if at all), cut back on unprocessed red meat and avoid processed meats. To stay on top of your health, talk with a healthcare professional about your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-11697620" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk for colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and when to get screened.
