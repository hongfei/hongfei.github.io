			&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss, surveys suggest that most people still &lt;a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/ddlsxvhlvp/pcrm-mc-weight-loss-report-9.27.24"&gt;prefer to lose weight without using medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those preferring a drug-free approach to weight loss, research shows that certain nutrients and dietary strategies can naturally mimic the effects of semaglutides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased intakes of fibre and monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) – as well as the time of day when foods are eaten, the order that foods are eaten in, the speed of eating and even chewing – can naturally stimulate increased production of the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a family physician with a PhD in nutrition, I translate the latest nutrition science into dietary recommendations for my patients. A strategic approach to weight loss rooted in the latest science is not only superior to antiquated calorie counting, but also capitalizes on the same biological mechanisms responsible for the success of popular weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="olive oil pouring into a glass dish, with some green olives" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Increased intake of monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) is one factor in naturally stimulating GLP-1 production — the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic. (Stevepb/Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide medications work by increasing the levels of a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), a satiety signal that slows digestion and makes us feel full. These drugs also simultaneously decrease levels of an enzyme called DPP-4, which inactivates GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, this "stop eating" hormone that naturally survives for only a few minutes can survive for an entire week. This enables a semi-permanent, just-eaten sensation of fullness that consequently leads to decreased food intake and, ultimately, weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, medications aren't the only way to raise GLP-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you eat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre – predominantly found in beans, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds – is the most notable nutrient that can significantly increase GLP-1. When fibre is fermented by the trillions of bacteria that live in our intestines, the resultant byproduct, called short chain fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao5774"&gt;stimulates the production of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may explain why fibre consumption is one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxz117"&gt;strongest predictors of weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqz292"&gt;shown to enable weight loss&lt;/a&gt; even in the absence of calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monounsaturated fats – found in olive oil and avocado oil – are another nutrient that raises GLP-1. One study showed that GLP-1 levels were higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/69.6.1135"&gt;following the consumption of bread and olive oil&lt;/a&gt; compared to bread and butter. Though notably, bread consumed with any kind of fat (be it from butter or even cheese) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;raises GLP-1 more than bread alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11050952"&gt;having an avocado&lt;/a&gt; alongside your breakfast bagel also increases GLP-1 more so than eating the bagel on its own. Nuts that are high in both fibre and monounsaturated fats, like pistachios, have also been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;shown to raise GLP-1 levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How you eat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific foods and nutrients that influence GLP-1 levels are only half the story. GLP-1 is a good example of how it's not just what you eat that matters, it's also how you eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that meal sequence – the order foods are eaten in – can impact GLP-1. Eating protein, like fish or meat, before carbohydrates, like rice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3841-z"&gt;results in a higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating carbohydrates before protein. Eating vegetables before carbohydrates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_704_20"&gt;has a similar effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161818" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161818" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642.jpg" alt="man eating salad" class="wp-image-161818 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161818" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The order of food and the timing of meals can all affect levels of GLP-1. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MACmIUKTQC8/"&gt;Michal Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time of day also matters, because like all hormones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.991397"&gt;GLP-1 follows a circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. A meal eaten at 8 am stimulates a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-0366"&gt;more pronounced release of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; compared to the same meal at 5 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may partly explain why the old saying "eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper" is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20460"&gt;backed by evidence&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates greater weight loss when breakfast is the largest meal of the day and dinner is the smallest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of eating can matter, too. Eating ice cream over 30 minutes has been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-1018"&gt;produce a significantly higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating ice cream over five minutes. However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15051174"&gt;studies looking at blood sugar responses&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that if vegetables are eaten first, the speed of eating becomes less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even chewing matters. One study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58103-w"&gt;eating shredded cabbage raised GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; more than drinking pureed cabbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not as potent as medication&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While certain foods and dietary strategies can increase GLP-1 naturally, the magnitude is far less than what is achievable with medications. One study of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3406"&gt;GLP-1 raising effects of the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated a peak GLP-1 level of approximately 59 picograms per millilitre of blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product monograph for Ozempic reports that the lowest dose &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209637lbl.pdf"&gt;produces a GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; of 65 nanograms per millilitre (one nanogram = 1,000 picograms). So medications raise GLP-1 more than one thousand times higher than diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when you compare long-term risk for diseases like heart attacks, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietitians.ca/DietitiansOfCanada/media/Documents/Mediterranean%20Diet%20Toolkit/Mediterranean-Diet-Toolkit-A-Guide-to-Healthy-Eating-(handout).pdf"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389"&gt;lowers risk of cardiac events by 30 per cent&lt;/a&gt;, outperforming GLP-1 medications that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;lower risk by 20 per cent&lt;/a&gt;. While weight loss will always be faster with medications, for overall health, dietary approaches are superior to medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following strategies are important for those trying to lose weight without a prescription:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to make breakfast the largest meal of the day (or at least frontload your day as much as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to eat at least one fibre-rich food at every meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make olive oil a dietary staple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of the order that you eat foods in, consume protein and vegetables before carbohydrates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snack on nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chew your food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While natural approaches to raising GLP-1 may not be as potent as medications, they provide a drug-free approach to weight loss and healthy eating.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253728/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

'We were told 'you need to go home and pack a bag for William and yourself - we didn't know what that meant other than we knew one of the test results showed spots on his liver.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family went to the Emergency department at Westmead Children's Hospital and after speaking with a doctor they met with an Oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danielle Smith has shared how at aged six her son William suffered from an upset stomach and appeared lethargic. Although these symptoms could easily have been a virus, she pushed for further investigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember him saying: 'I hope I'm the wrong doctor for you,' but explained that they needed to run more tests.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially the team thought it was lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, and tests showed that William had several tumours throughout his body, the largest being on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The oncologist was showing the scans and was pointing out the tumours, they were all through his body. I just kept thinking how could there be this many tumours and we didn't know and how could there be this many tumours and William didn't know,' Danielle shared as her voice began to crack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went down the scan and said 'this is William's heart', he scrolled down and said, 'this is the tumour on the liver.' I asked him to scroll back up because the primary tumour was bigger than his heart. How could it be bigger than his heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is the moment that killed me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After having tests at the doctors, Danielle was told to pack a bag for her and her son and head to the hospital, where staff were waiting for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite learning that crushing information that would be impossible for any parent to hear, Danielle remained stoic and strong for William.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can't fall apart but so much happens so fast. When you've got your six-year-old who asks: 'Mum am I going to die?' — what do you say to your child in that moment? You have to protect your child and do the best you can. You just can't fall apart.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two weeks after being admitted to hospital and after William had already started chemotherapy treatment, he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer that starts in the early nerve cells of the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William's cancer was stage 4, high-risk and aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What followed was a gruelling series of treatments for William, including six rounds of chemotherapy, two back to back bone marrow transplants that saw him put in isolation from the public for nine long months, radiation and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly two weeks after being admitted to hospital and after William had already started chemotherapy treatment, he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;What followed was a gruelling series of treatments for William, including six rounds of chemotherapy, two back to back bone marrow transplants that saw him put in isolation from the public for nine long months, radiation and immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 18 months after treatment had begun, William was finally finished, but then in a cruel twist, a scan showed another tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It fell into a pattern at that point, another scan, another tumour, another scan, another tumour. This went on for a while,' Danielle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2018 we were away on a holiday on the coast there was about 30 of us making memories together and I knew that something wasn't right. I noticed that one of his eyes had turned and he wasn't looking straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had scans booked when we got home and at that point the oncologist had asked William to stay in the waiting room and he told me to prepare myself, I knew what he was going to say.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was given 6 to 8 weeks. I had prepared myself that he was palliative, and I had got to a point but everything I had read said it would be six to eight months, so I assumed that we had that time. I can't even put that into words how I felt when I heard that prognosis. Pretty much eight weeks later he passed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tragically in early 2018 William passed away and the family were left devastated &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite knowing what was coming in those last eight weeks, if you were around him, you wouldn't have known, people couldn't believe he was so sick, he didn't let it show,' Danielle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During his gruelling treatment, William was happy to share his experience with other children and families who were going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was very open and willing to talk about his experience. He talked to other children at the hospital and was very willing to advocate on what he was going through. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and they would talk together about it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle and her two eldest children were inspired by William to help other children and their relatives who were battling cancer and raise funds for the Kids With Cancer charity by hosting the annual Gold Ribbon Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives purpose to why William was here. We would struggle to deal with something so terrible happening to us without it, so the three of us definitely use it as a healing technique and way of coping with our grief,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William's mum and siblings were inspired by him to help other families and fundraise for Kids with Cancer. To honour William's memory on what would have been his 16th birthday they are raising awareness for the charity's Care Pack 4 Kids campaign &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This month, to recognise what would have been William's 16th birthday, Danielle is raising awareness for the charity's &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kidswithcancer.org.au/care-packs-4-kids/"&gt;Care Packs 4 Kids campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bespoke gift boxes contain sweet and savoury snacks, puzzles and activities and a hand-written inspirational note. The packs are offered to oncology patients each time they attend a children's hospital across Australia.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Time in hospital is long and whether you're there for a day visit or a longer stay it's really hard to keep your child entertained. The care packs provide that bit of distraction but it also hits home that there is somebody out there that cares with the handwritten notes,' Danielle explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something so small can make a big difference and even if it's just for five minutes that the child forgets about their cancer or their treatment, it's like five years for the parents.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I think if William was with us today he's be joining in the fundraising, he'd probably be leading it and driving it. I think he'd be proud,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given what Danielle and her family went through, the Sydney mum is well placed to share advice to families who find themselves in a similar situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who might be going through a possible cancer diagnosis she said, 'My advice would be to advocate for your child and to voice how you feel, voice what your concerns are.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle admits it was 'hard' for her to accept help from others in the period following William's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It took me a good few months to accept the support and to advocate for him and ask all of the questions.

Pesticides. Golf courses often use significant amounts of pesticides to maintain their pristine appearance. These chemicals can become airborne or leach into the groundwater, leading to increased exposure for nearby residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights concerns about water contamination. Residents who share a water source with a golf course, particularly those relying on groundwater, face nearly double the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease compared to those with separate water sources. This risk is even more pronounced in areas with vulnerable geological features, such as karst topography, which allows for easier movement of contaminants into the water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the findings underscore the need for public health policies aimed at reducing pesticide exposure, especially in residential areas near golf courses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing stricter regulations on pesticide use and improving water treatment processes could mitigate some of the risks identified in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti aging billionaire Bryan Johnson shared on X a screenshot of the study. "It's a good idea to routinely test the water you drink," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What pesticides are harmful?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to golf courses and Parkinson’s disease, the most concerning pesticides are those that have been scientifically linked to neurotoxicity — meaning they can damage or disrupt the nervous system. Here are the main culprits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraquat: Paraquat has been heavily linked to Parkinson’s disease in numerous studies. It kills plant cells through oxidative stress, and researchers believe it may do the same to neurons in the human brain — particularly those involved in motor control. It is banned in over 30 countries (including the EU and China), but still used in the U.S. under restricted conditions. "The US Environmental Protection Agency classifies paraquat as "restricted use."1 This means that it can be used only by people who have licenses. Because paraquat is highly poisonous, the United States requires the following safety measures: Blue dye is added to keep it from being confused with other beverages," the US CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chlorpyrifos: It is banned in the U.S. for food crops as of 2021, but may still be used on golf courses or in non-agricultural settings. It is known to disrupt neurotransmitter function, especially acetylcholine. Prenatal and long-term exposure is associated with developmental delays and neurological disorders. It is an organophosphate insecticide used to kill a range of insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maneb and Mancozeb (Dithiocarbamates): These are fungicides often used in landscaping, including on golf courses and are often studied in combination with Paraquat; exposure to both has shown to drastically increase Parkinson’s risk. These chemicals disrupt dopamine production — a key hormone depleted in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate: Although primarily linked to cancer (specifically non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), emerging research suggests glyphosate might also affect gut health and neurological function — both of which are closely linked to Parkinson’s. It is world’s most widely used herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case-control study included patients with incident PD and matched controls from the Rochester Epidemiology Project from 1991 to 2015. Data were analyzed between June and August 2024. A total of 419 incident PD cases were identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxNcHJ4RDVhVjRSd283eUFhYzVNVVE3OWZxRFlIajhvcVBKc293VlJsNVpVTE4xSnZBWVhvTnFVSE9WVmU4a0hoTTBaeVhUWjIzTjAxeHFQMDl3VFNyY2NxMUZDNXlXUHRCaEFVeDFHdjJfTnhMeDFmVUVwUkhXVkRieHliZ0F2Z1lhX1ZBTDNCN2psMHF6RnI5M1NYOXAyaUNrdlpiQlkzdEctZTQ0SHhIbWhUb3oxOWJmci1DQXQtNV9pRlhUMzh2YnlQWl9vT0xOeEhnd29mZkhzSXZWVGo5b3dZWWlURFhPWE5KQVA4ZlZUcDlxR1ZiMVhsVHNUMVBoaE9LNmQ2RDBfRm9JMHVLSUhB0gGXAkFVX3lxTE42WTNvLUNmLXpGSTFCWjk1M2V1U0tockNsZjFUNUVia2JiYkU2VU1rR0xEcGptb3pTRU5DZTdMaFhrYlRqbDhwTzNKdkQ5MC1RWDZ4TmJZQWl4VkJpSWJRM2JIYU9zLUVUZ2Jmb25nT1BMY2QyU0NlYnEzSHBEc0xyWXBrNjlrUlNYR3pwQS04eWdrekJRczZWVS1QSUdWX08xYlpwWGRXRzlGdDN5SFZpY3puRVhDSjlHY1dsWjhDeE9jZVN2Vld6Sk1lTkJDZWVfM2hYMGJpV2g1QkJSOXRSVU9QYTYzRy04YVRRaDhwNUlSQ2MtS0FjeG9mU3BwZG9oX3FvaHNDNngwSC1XYUhrWGlyZzBWWQ</guid></item><item><title>为什么你的手和脚总是很冷，以及你的身体试图告诉你什么- AOL.com | Why Your Hands and Feet Are Always Cold—and What Your Body’s Trying To Tell You - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5mTlVIY1J5WEVWSFl2TjYxUzVUd2VkdjgwRm5hUGs2czV1WklXRzJ6c0ZrQXNydG1aeFU2enVVQjZCMXRKQnoyTFhWYS1yWjU3WVRGLVVzbjV3THVOR0xNN2tnN1RhUzBmQThlRFd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re lying on the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/shopping/soscana-4-seat-sectional-sofa-walmart-sale-may-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sofa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sofa&lt;/a&gt;, sitting at work or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1151185/ericasweeney/benefits-of-walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; around outside, your hands and feet are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; cold.

Besides cold hands and feet, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21882-poor-circulation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you may notice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;you may notice&lt;/a&gt; muscles that hurt or feel weak when you walk, a “pins and needles” sensation, a pale or blue skin color, and numbness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When blood flow to the extremities is reduced, the body has a harder time keeping those areas warm,” explains &lt;a href="https://claya.com/our-medical-experts/#dr-jennifer-habashy-nmd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jennifer Habashy, NMD, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jennifer Habashy, NMD, MS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a naturopathic doctor and assistant medical director at Claya. She says poor circulation is “one of the more common reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What helps, Dr. Habashy continues, is staying active with &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/walking-10000-steps-a-day-for-a-month-results" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;daily movement&lt;/a&gt;, wearing warm socks or gloves and trying contrast hydrotherapy (so alternating warm and cold water on your hands and feet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Raynaud’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/raynauds-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20363571" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raynaud’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Raynaud’s&lt;/a&gt; is when small blood vessels narrow in response to cold temperatures or stress. Signs include areas of skin turning white then blue, and a numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming up or easing stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news is it’s treatable. “With Raynaud’s or circulation-related issues, keep warm, avoid smoking, limit caffeine and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/997659/nicolepajer/stress-relief/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manage stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;manage stress&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Khanna says. To manage stress, he recommends cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1036167/marijkevroomendurning/what-is-mindfulness/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mindfulness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1072693/jenniferlarson/rare-autoimmune-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Rare Autoimmune Diseases That Don’t Get Enough Attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Rare Autoimmune Diseases That Don’t Get Enough Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hypothyroidism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hypothyroidism.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hypothyroidism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hypothyroidism&lt;/a&gt; is an underactive thyroid. But how does that affect the temperature of your hands and feet? Dr. Habashy says it’s “where a sluggish thyroid slows down metabolic activity, reducing the body’s ability to generate heat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs include fatigue, weight gain, joint and muscle pain, constipation, dry skin, thinning hair and more. “Cold intolerance is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common in hypothyroidism,” Dr. Khanna adds. “I always check for this.” To determine if you have this condition, these doctors recommend getting a full thyroid panel at your doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anemia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anemia&lt;/a&gt; is a common blood disorder in which a person doesn’t have enough red blood cells, or the ones they have don’t function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1229513/shameikarhymes/iron-infusion-for-anemia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I Had Iron Infusions to Treat My Severe Anemia’—Writer Shameika Rhymes Opens Up About Her Health Journey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I Had Iron Infusions to Treat My Severe Anemia’—Writer Shameika Rhymes Opens Up About Her Health Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anemia is also a frequent contributor, as low iron levels impair oxygen delivery to tissues, which can make the extremities feel cold,” Dr. Kabashy explains. Additional signs include weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, headache, chest pain and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition needs to be assessed by your primary care provider, Dr. Khanna says, who can order a CBC (AKA, a complete blood count) test and iron studies. He and Dr. Habashy also recommend addressing the nutritional side of things; make sure you &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1143900/shameikarhymes/foods-high-in-iron/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:get enough iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;get enough iron&lt;/a&gt;, B12 and folate in your diet.

So, remember to eat those foods listed above. You can also get labs to assess which nutrients you’re deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persistent cold hands and feet aren’t always something to brush off,” she concludes. “Paying attention to your patterns (and getting the right testing) can help uncover the root cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1339453/emily-laurence/toe-cramps/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Ouch!

commonly referred to as the 'paisa mutation' - has been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2897185/The-village-residents-dementia-age-40-Genetic-mutation-marrying-families-means-Yamural-curse-spiralling-control.html"&gt;passed down by a gene from a single common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; to an extended lineage of 6,000 people in the town and it &lt;font&gt;causes Alzheimer's in nearly every person that has it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Located on the 14th chromosome, it leads to a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's and leaves patients suffering from crippling dementia. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Those who have the mutation also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as early as their 30s.&lt;/font&gt; In the US, the average age is 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, after decades of misery, one person's unique genetic mutation could hold the secret to a cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennie Erin Smith, author of &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Valley of Forgetting: Alzheimer's Families and the Search for a Cure&lt;/span&gt;, followed University of California Santa Barbara neuroscientist Dr Kenneth Kosik and Colombian neuroscientist Dr Francisco Lopera as they spent four decades studying Yarumal residents - until they stumbled upon Aliria Rosa Piedrahita de Villegas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Piedrahita de Villegas, who died at 77 from cancer, was born and raised in Yarumal and had the paisa mutation. However, she spent her entire life without being afflicted by Alzheimer's,&lt;span&gt; even &lt;/span&gt;as her younger family members were plagued by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A perplexing case, scientists eventually learned that not only did she have the dementia gene, she had another mutation that actually safeguarded her from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thousands of residents in Yarumal, a quaint town, have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease - showing signs in their 30s and 40s, dying in their 50s - all due to a genetic mutation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, experts believe if they are able to understand and replicate the mysterious protective effect observed in Piedrahita de Villegas's brain, they might be able to prevent the development of the disease in other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kosik recalled: 'She was so fascinating because she had this mutation that just inevitably leads to Alzheimer's disease and here she was, 70-something years old and still fine.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through her participation in the team's research and her family's willingness to donate her brain after her death in 2020, both neuroscientists have been able to make significant progress in understanding&lt;span&gt; potential cures for a disease that affects about 44million people globally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects older adults. About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The illness begins due to the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid protein molecules stick together in the brain cells, forming clumps called plaques. Tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The World Health Organization predicts 115million people worldwide will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Pictured is a brain scan of a 74-year-old patient with the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the disease, experts believe it can develop due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no cure but doctors can prescribe treatments and therapies to try and ease symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik believes he may have now uncovered previously unknown clues as to how Piedrahita de Villegas managed to evade the disease while her entire family succumbed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: University of California Santa Barbara neuroscientist Dr Kenneth Kosik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the UCSB neuroscientist, investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital found Piedrahita de Villegas's brain had exceptionally large quantities of amyloid protein but nearly no tau protein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the lack of tau protein, her brain didn't develop the hallmark tangles of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik said: '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One clue that appeared when researchers examined her brain tissue [was] while Aliria had the same overproduction of plaques that the rest of her family had, the tangles of misfolded tau protein that typically accompany the plaques in Alzheimer's patients in her were relatively scant, keeping intact things like motor skills and executive function.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the paisa mutation, the team also found her DNA carried two copies of another rare gene mutation called &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0611-3#Abs1"&gt;apolipoprotein or APOE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A single parent can pass down the mutation, located on the 14th chromosome – which causes a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's and leave patients suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the Christchurch mutation, the APOE gene variant allowed her body to produce lipoproteins that protected her brain from Alzheimer's disease by counteracting the effects of the amyloid protein-caused plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lipoproteins are molecules made of proteins and fats in the body and they carry cholesterol through the bloodstream to cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two main groups of lipoproteins are called HDL (high-density lipoprotein) or 'good' cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or 'bad' cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, scientists are hoping this discovery can lead to treatments or preventatives therapies for people with or at risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik said: 'The probability of one rare mutation is very small, but a person with two exceptionally rare mutations in the setting of an Alzheimer's rare mutation, how unlikely is that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'She was a very important patient; her story made news all over the world. We learned a lot from her - and now that she's died, it's on us to make sure we give it a careful look.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although people might not often talk about peeing-related problems, there are lots of common bladder health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incontinence (or ‘leaky bladder’) that accidentally loses urine when you don’t want it to is the most common bladder issue in individuals,” explained &lt;a href="https://yourfavoriteurologist.com/my-story/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Fenwa Milhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified urologist and specialist in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. “Frequent urination is also a very common complaint in individuals, and can be especially bothersome when this occurs at night or while sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, is a long-term condition that causes pain and discomfort in the bladder, which is often irritated, or in the pelvic area. There’s also a sensation of needing to pee often and urgently. “When patients are experiencing overactive bladder or symptoms of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, our first recommendation is to limit bladder irritants,” Ackerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that changing up your diet may reduce your issues. “Often diet alone and elimination of bladder irritants will control the patient’s symptoms,” Ackerman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you have a healthy bladder, knowing what foods and drinks are irritants will be beneficial. “Awareness of foods and beverages that can cause irritation can be helpful to prevent bladder symptoms for those that are not currently having concerns,” said &lt;a href="https://aeroflowurology.com/aleece-fosnight" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aleece Fosnight&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified physician assistant specializing in women’s health and urology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, urologists and medical experts share the foods and drinks that you should limit or avoid for a healthy bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love your morning cup or three of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/coffee" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;? You may rely on it to wake up and stay alert, but your bladder may not be so happy. Coffee contains a couple of irritants ― caffeine and acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The caffeine in coffee is a known diuretic, meaning it makes you produce more urine, increasing bladder frequency,” Milhouse explained. “Caffeine has also been observed to increase the urgency of urination, making it harder to control your bladder and more likely to have bladder leaks.” Ackerman added that “acidic foods and drinks can be irritating and also exacerbate these symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t want to give up your brew just yet, Milhouse said coffee and tea can be enjoyed in moderation. “If you have no bladder issues, two 8-ounce cups of coffee or less is ideal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who already deal with pain or frequent urination might need to limit or eliminate coffee until symptoms subside. “Avoiding coffee altogether may be necessary for some individuals who struggle with overactive bladder or bladder pain,” Milhouse said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2833575#:~:text=Parental%20SUDs%20consisted%20of%20alcohol,drug%20use%20disorders%20(Figure).&amp;amp;text=Nearly%2019%20million%20children%20were,all%20US%20children%20in%202023."&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that nearly 19 million US children under the age of 18—about 1 in 4—live with at least one parent with a substance use disorder, a figure notably higher than earlier estimates that relied on older diagnostic criteria. This study used data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, per &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5393935/quarter-children-have-parent-substance-use-disorder-study"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Of those 19 million kids, 7.6 million have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction, and 3.4 million live with a parent dealing with multiple substance-use disorders. Authors also found that more than 6 million children have a parent dealing with both a substance use disorder and a mental health condition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Most parental substance-use disorders identified in the study involve alcohol, which remains the main cause of substance-related deaths in the US, per Dr. Scott Hadland, adolescent medicine chief at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Experts say exposure to parental addiction can place children at increased risk for physical accidents, mental health conditions, and developing substance use problems themselves. Barriers to accessing care, including stigma, mean that most parents with a substance use disorder don't seek treatment.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Hadland notes that these findings mean pediatricians need to be especially vigilant in screening families and connecting them to treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine screening for substance use within families, and many clinics now ask about parental substance use as part of developmental screenings.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; The future of the survey from which the data was culled, meanwhile, is unclear following a recent workforce reduction. Per a &lt;a href="https://news.umich.edu/1-in-4-kids-live-with-parents-who-have-alcohol-other-drug-problems-u-m-study-finds/"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;, the survey's entire staff was laid off in April due to budget cuts at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (This content was created with the help of AI.

&lt;p&gt;They’re lovin’ it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People on TikTok are claiming that a specific &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/lifestyle/mcdonalds-launches-top-tier-new-mcflurry-flavor-to-celebrate-desserts-30th-anniversary-but-theres-a-catch/"&gt;McDonald’s order&lt;/a&gt; is helping cure their migraines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “migraine meal” is a large Coca-Cola drink and an order of large fries — and many&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/health/doctor-reveals-how-to-prevent-and-manage-headaches-migraine/"&gt; sufferers&lt;/a&gt; online can’t get enough of this combo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@millyhancockk/video/7503985153090342166" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt; — with over 3 million views — shows a girl at the fast food chain’s drive-thru with overlay text reading, “Trying McDonald’s chips [fries] and a Diet Coke because I’ve had a headache for 48 hours and TikTok said it would help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the comments on the video chimed in praising this cure.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“I know it’s just the salt and caffeine but every time I have a migraine or even one coming on I get a coke and a fry and it’s immediately cured,” one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s my go to!! I take my migraine meds, sip a Diet Coke, and as my pain goes away, I crave salt…” a comment read.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not Diet Coke!!! Full sugar Coke + ibuprofen + something salty,” another person advised. &lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I know it’s just the salt and caffeine but every time I have a migraine or even one coming on I get a coke and a fry and it’s immediately cured,” one person wrote in the comment section of a viral TikTok video. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Diet Coke works on headaches, I don’t understand it , considering a coffee makes it worse,” a confused commenter chimed in, writing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any sort of “hack” — especially a health one — seen online always has to be taken with a grain of salt. However, this one in particular might be worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in the Coke has pain relief properties, especially when used simultaneously with other pain relievers like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know the caffeine can help migraines in the short-term therapy of them. So it isn’t too surprising that the caffeine in Coca-Cola itself is helpful,” Dr. David Walker, MD, told &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/mcmigraine-11727032" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Very Well Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rarely are people told that salty foods can actually do the body some good — but in this case, salty fries for the win.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Since migraines are often caused by “a deficiency of minerals such as sodium,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mcdonalds-order-tiktok-claims-cure-163000602.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEjddFThkZVq_4U6uxRdal3PFd3FJQ33UoEwa5sB5SVtP14R14Q7tAM9XHtn-H10nmuvx-fimyzDJQagHrxLlbtY_81KOOGkdOhh27F62OlEoZ9W4OroUhUzo_r7yteqrBV9V3Sc_uEdkNRxl2_fjmIwOwQwg-wUwu5D91tr-LLn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Yahoo! Life&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/lifestyle/the-5-worst-fast-foods-for-your-health-that-you-should-avoid-at-all-costs/?preview_id=35376074&amp;amp;_thumbnail_id=35376620"&gt;salt on the fries &lt;/a&gt;can supposedly act as a source of electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that everyone’s body is different and migraines vary from person to person, so this hack night not be the cure-all for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This treat meal is not the worst idea from time to time, if it can help relieve a headache or migraine — just don’t make your McDonald’s run a habit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone finds that they improve with this hack, that’s great for them,” Dr. Matthew Robbins told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/migraine-meal-hack-neurologists-explain-rcna206858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;. “But if they’re using it often, that’s not good for you either.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002d3b751duddgsz@published"&gt;My boyfriend and I are at odds because he has grown out his beard and I refuse to have sex with him again until he gets rid of it. I think beards are gross—they are dirt magnets and I can’t stand the feel of them. I was at a sex party once and ended an encounter with a guy who was eating me out because the feel of his beard against my pussy was awful. My boyfriend says it’s his body, so it should be up to him. As far as I’m concerned, not if it causes me physical displeasure. That should give me the final say, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002g3b758eko15yu@published"&gt;In a sense you have the final say because you get to say no to sex for whatever reason. Your body, your choice. But the same principle applies to your boyfriend. If he wants a beard, he gets to have a beard. You have a good reason for wanting him to get rid of it: You find it uncomfortable during oral sex. But he has a good reason for wanting to keep it: He likes it. In the case of such a draw, it’s the body owner’s choice. The beard stays if he wants it to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002h3b751fyxb6ig@published"&gt;Now, your decision to refrain from sex may eventually win him to your side. One might call this manipulation, and maybe it is in some sense, but again, you have a valid reason for not wanting your bush to come in contact with his. Could you do stuff sexually anyway that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;involve beard-on-skin contact? Sure, but if things like kissing and oral are essential to your sex life, I can understand how that kind of activity would be much less attractive in light of his facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="183" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002i3b75f6zhv3ci@published"&gt;The problem with this kind of bargaining is that it might not be bargaining at all. It may lead to a stalemate. And then what? If you both hold out, neither of you win, per se, because you’re cutting off a presumably important part of your relationship. There can only be losers here. Maybe you wear him down and he relents and you’re happy and at least he’s getting laid. Maybe you never have sex again and decide to break up. I would encourage some kind of compromise here—perhaps you can find a length of beard that is beardy enough to satisfy his aesthetic purposes but not so beardy that it feels terrible against your vulva. Maybe he settles for a mustache or resolves to be the first guy in history to make a soul patch look cool. You should be willing to give at least a little here, as generosity is a good force to bring to the coupling and finding a mutually satisfying path forward is what you do in relationships. If you can’t, his beard may be an irreconcilable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pa001z3b75tpg5bdel@published"&gt;There are a few subcategories of premature ejaculation. There’s lifelong PE and then there’s &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354900"&gt;acquired PE&lt;/a&gt;—the latter is seen in people who previously had no sexual problems of this nature, like your husband. PE can have &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15627-premature-ejaculation"&gt;psychological roots&lt;/a&gt;—things like stress and anxiety can contribute, so if your husband has any new stressors or changes in his life, that may explain it. As the sexuality counselor Ian Kerner put it when I emailed him for &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/10/bi-boyfriend-piv-problem-advice.html"&gt;a past column&lt;/a&gt; about this issue, regarding acquired PE: “In almost all cases, the cause is performance anxiety which is governed by our sympathetic nervous system that mediates fight or flight response.” In other words, worrying about coming too fast can sometimes make it worse. And feeling guilty or ashamed about it can cause some people to rush through sex, exacerbating the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pa00203b754d8eikcu@published"&gt;Keep in mind that PE can also indicate physical issues like a hormonal problem or enlarged prostate. When someone sees a shift in sexual functioning—especially one this severe—it’s best to go see a doctor to make sure there isn’t an underlying health issue. Get your husband to the urologist as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

And then there is the stop-start method, which, much as it sounds, involves him penetrating for as long as he can without getting to the point of no return. As he approaches, he pulls out, takes a breather, and then continues. He repeats this as many times as possible. If those methods don’t work, sometimes a low dose of an SSRI is prescribed (since that class of drugs can delay ejaculation). A numbing spray may help, as may wearing a condom, though neither address the root cause of acquired PE, and might diminish his sensation in unenjoyable ways. Try any or all of these, and see &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/10/bi-boyfriend-piv-problem-advice.html"&gt;this past column&lt;/a&gt; for more in-depth advice on treating this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now you simply don’t know. Attempt to collect more information. Don’t badger her with requests. Instead, bring up how much you miss her head—they were the best you’ve ever had, which might feel good for her to know—and how much of an important feature of your sex life to you that it was. Why is she no longer into it, and is there anything you can do to help her get into it again? Perhaps it’s something you’ve been doing that turns her off—maybe she doesn’t like the way that you talk to her while she’s sucking you off, or maybe you’ve held her head in such a way that makes her uncomfortable. Maybe it’s not you at all but some kind of other external influence or inner voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pb00273b75ic9v9cl2@published"&gt;If she becomes uncomfortable during these conversations, back off for a little while and return again in a few weeks/months. Underscore the importance of blowjobs (though keep the drama out of the equation and avoid exaggerating terms like “heartsick” to describe your relationship to her head). You should also assess whether this indicates larger issues around sex or communication. Is your sex life otherwise perfect? Is she fully satisfied? Understand that things like this exist in context and your self-awareness may not be sharp as you think it is. You can always discuss joint sex counseling if you can’t get any clarity from her.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pb00283b75aoookn62@published"&gt;The fact is it’s your wife’s right to say no to anything. It’s her right to change her mind. You are not entitled to the blowjobs that she once gave you. You never were. I don’t think this is a matter of “convincing” her to give you head, I think this is an opportunity to seek more information and bolster your communication. Once things are clearer, you still must take no for an answer, but at the very least maybe your wife could help you come up with a satisfying alternative path to your own satisfaction. Does she really think that you should live the rest of your life without blowjobs? The answer to that may be illuminating and help you figure out potential next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On one visit, she asked for a blood test and the doctor turned her away, telling her that she was depressed and gave her a number to call for support. “I couldn’t believe that I wasn’t being listened to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think I had depression and I was worried because I felt as if my brain was getting slower, and in all honesty, dumber. I hated getting that ‘stuck in my throat’ moment when words were lost to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, she didn’t take any long-term leave from work but had more sick days compared to colleagues. “My immune system was so rubbish that I would catch every single bug under the sun and I would be ill all the time – it was so frustrating and I just couldn’t work out what was wrong,” Ford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At one desperate point, I thought that it could just be me – maybe I was just lazy and couldn’t cope with a full-time job. I felt like I was crazy. I knew I had all these symptoms but all the medical professionals were brushing them off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Finally, a diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 18 months after first seeking help, when she was 22, Ford saw a female GP. “I walked into the appointment and as I sat down, she asked me what was wrong and I just burst into tears,” she recalls. “She listened to me and said she thought I needed a full blood count to determine what was wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the turning point because, four days later, the results came back and showed she had severe hypothyroidism, also known as an underactive thyroid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a condition that affects 1-2 per cent of the population and is more common in women than men. It occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid glands – a small gland in the neck, shaped like a butterfly or bow tie, just in front of the windpipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the thyroid can’t make enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4), which is responsible for regulating metabolism (the chemical reactions in our body), explains Dr Nicola Zammitt, a consultant endocrinologist in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiredness is one of the main symptoms of hypothyroidism. “It feels like there isn’t enough gas in the tank,” she says. “Everything’s slowed down too much. There’s a tendency to put on weight, to feel the cold more and your bowels slow down, so people tend to be constipated,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include depression, slow movements and thoughts, muscle aches and weakness, dry and scaly skin, brittle hair and nails, a loss of libido, pain and numbness in the hands and fingers, as well as irregular or heavy periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diagnosis was a massive relief and made so much sense,” Ford says. “It confirmed that I really was ill and that it wasn’t just in my head and, most importantly, it meant that I could be treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why hypothyroidism is so difficult to spot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ford’s road to diagnosis was long, it shouldn’t have to be. “Confirming a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is straightforward and involves a simple, cheap blood test that any GP is able to do,” explains Dr Zammitt, who is also a trustee for the British Thyroid Foundation. The blood sample then goes to a biochemistry lab and results show whether a thyroid is working normally, is underactive or overactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can be difficult for doctors to spot that a patient’s symptoms are a result of a thyroid problem, and refer them for this test, she notes. This is because the main symptom – tiredness – is a common symptom of many illnesses, meaning it can sometimes take a while for patients to be diagnosed, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other tell-tale sign of hypothyroidism is weight gain and most cases of hypothyroidism occur in midlife. “So, imagine a woman in her 40s or 50s saying that she’s put on weight and is feeling sluggish – very often, doctors will think these are simply symptoms of the menopause,” Dr Zammitt notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hypothyroidism can occur at any age, most cases are among the over-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cause is autoimmune disease, where antibodies (cells produced by the immune system to fight off infection) mistakenly attack the thyroid gland, damaging it, Dr Zammitt says. Doctors don’t yet know what causes the immune system to overreact in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some babies are born with an underactive thyroid, which is called congenital hypothyroidism (which all babies in the UK are screened for within the first few weeks of life), but this is relatively uncommon, Dr Zammitt notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Living with hypothyroidism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can’t cure hypothyroidism, Ford takes a medication called T4 levothyroxine. It’s a daily tablet that replaces the thyroxine that her body can’t make enough of on its own and reduces the severity of her brain fog, tiredness and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still have flare-ups,” she notes. “I don’t know what causes them – it could just be a bug – but I’m just really rubbish on those days. I feel slow and I find it really hard to talk. The brain fog will get so bad that I just cannot function. It really gets me down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford still works a full-time job, has a four-year-old son and is also a newly published author, finding solace in writing as something she could do, even when she felt short of energy. Her first novel &lt;em&gt;Work Trip&lt;/em&gt; – a rom-com that sees two colleagues who dislike each other forced together while travelling for work – is out now, and she has another book out in October called &lt;em&gt;House Party&lt;/em&gt;. “I’m not very good at practising rest,” she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My experience has left me wondering how many people suffer with thyroid issues for a long time without realising the cause, or that there are treatments available,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There main consequences of an undiagnosed underactive thyroid relate to symptoms going untreated, as it can lead to high cholesterol, which raises the risk of heart disease and strokes, Dr Zammitt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of treatment can also lead to a rare complication called myxoedema, which is a severely underactive thyroid that can cause the heart rate, body temperature and sodium levels to become worryingly low, she notes. Symptoms of myxoedema include confusion and a drop in alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An untreated thyroid can ultimately lead to hospitalisation, intensive care and even death, though this is extremely uncommon as most people would get a diagnosis and take their medication to prevent these complications,” Dr Zammitt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have autoimmune hypothyroidism are also slightly more likely to develop other autoimmune conditions, such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/type-1-diabetes-what-are-the-signs-and-how-to-treat-it/"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, coeliac disease or Addison’s disease, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who have an underactive thyroid, or have undiagnosed symptoms, my biggest piece of advice would be to advocate for yourself,” Ford says. “I know it can be easier said than done but push for appointments and tests when things don’t feel right but keep pushing until you get the care you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, while it’s a condition that you’re going to have forever, it’s not all doom and gloom. You can hold down a job, have a family and even turn a hobby into a new career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Hypothyroidism FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What does our thyroid gland do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thyroid gland sits in the lower part of the neck and is shaped a little bit like a bow tie or butterfly, explains Dr Zammitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. and has multiple causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing sunscreen and avoiding excess sun exposure are the best protection. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows antioxidants may also help guard against this common cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spending time outside can boost your mood, promote better sleep and support your immune system (plus, it’s free!). The only drawback is that outdoor time also exposes you to the sun’s skin-damaging UV rays. Over time, that could set the stage for skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By far, the top risk factor for developing skin cancer is unprotected UV exposure, followed by genetic predisposition,” says dermatologist &lt;a href="https://facetdermatology.com/en-us/pages/our-team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Geeta Yadav, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is good news, though. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  many cases of skin cancer are largely preventable. Adopting safe sun habits like applying a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913195/best-reef-safe-sunscreens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broad-spectrum sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a hat, sunglasses and clothes that cover your arms and legs, and staying in the shade can all lower your UV exposure and significantly reduce your risk. So can avoiding tanning beds, which also emit large amounts of UV light.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also bolster your skin’s defenses from the inside out by eating more antioxidants. While diet plays a smaller role in skin cancer prevention, research reveals that antioxidants can provide additional protection to safeguard your skin from this all-too-common cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skin cancer occurs when abnormal skin cells develop in the skin’s outermost layer, called the epidermis. What causes those abnormal cells to develop and grow? The most common cause is DNA damage from exposure to UV rays, either from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, there are other risk factors too, like getting older or having a family history of skin cancer. You may also be more likely to develop skin cancer if you have blue or green eyes, red or blond hair or have skin that’s fair or burns or freckles easily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, most of these risk factors are beyond your control. But there is one helpful step you can take, and that’s eating an antioxidant-rich diet. In fact, research has found that dietary &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; can help counteract some of the damage caused by UV exposure before it turns into cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And the list is long: selenium, zinc, copper, carotenoids, polyphenols and vitamins A, C and E may all be protective, according to research. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Combat Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exposure to UV light sets off a chain reaction that creates a storm of skin-damaging compounds called free radicals. That’s where antioxidants step in. “Antioxidants combat free radicals, unstable molecules that can damage cells and their DNA, proteins and lipids,” says Yadav. “When there are too many free radicals in the body to the point that antioxidants cannot help neutralize them, oxidative stress occurs, leading to cellular dysfunction. This dysfunction could manifest as early signs of aging, but it could also manifest as cancer”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regularly consuming antioxidant-rich foods equips your body with the defenders needed to neutralize those free radicals before they cause long-term harm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Prevent the Spread of Cancerous Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all DNA damage leads to cancer. In fact, our bodies have a natural defense mechanism to kill off DNA-damaged cells before they turn cancerous and start to spread.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not fool-proof, and some damage can fall through the cracks. Fortunately, research reveals that antioxidants called anthocyanins may help speed the process. While anthocyanins are found in lots of fruits and vegetables, one of the best sources for skin protection is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/22787/ingredients/fruit/berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;. So, load up on these juicy fruits for an extra dose of prevention.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunburns aren’t just painful. This inflammatory reaction in your skin can cause long-lasting damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053196/foods-skin-protection-sun-damage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that they help absorb some of the sun’s harmful UV rays and reduce inflammation to decrease the development of sunburn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one study found that carotenoids, antioxidants found in yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables, could provide the equivalent sun protection to SPF 4 sunscreen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For the biggest bang, think tomatoes. They’re filled with a carotenoid called lycopene that’s been shown to guard against sun damage from the inside out.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the Rainbow:&lt;/strong&gt; An easy rule of thumb for adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; to your diet is to add more color to your plate. Fruits and vegetables with bright, deep hues are often the richest source of these beneficial compounds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brew a Cup of Green Tea&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a reason green tea is added to face creams, masks and serums. It’s rich in antioxidants called catechins that have been shown to calm UV-related skin inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savor Some Dark Chocolate: &lt;/strong&gt;While chocolate may not prevent skin cancer, it contains inflammation-taming antioxidants called polyphenols that may improve skin hydration and circulation. Since dark chocolate contains the most polyphenols, the darker the chocolate, the better!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting regular skin checks and practicing safe sun habits like applying sunscreen, wearing a hat and protective clothing, and staying in the shade may all help reduce your risk of skin cancer. While diet plays a much smaller role, research has found that antioxidants may offer additional protection. Antioxidants are believed to combat cancer-causing oxidative stress, slow the spread of cancer cells and boost your body’s internal defenses against inflammation and sunburn. And the best way to get more of them isn’t a pill or powder. It’s a diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables. So, before you hit the beach, park or pool, head to the produce aisle!&lt;br&gt;

In a rat model mimicking human exercise, scientists found that dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus during low-intensity activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurotransmitters were traced back to specific brainstem regions, the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus, which also showed activation. The more these regions were stimulated, the more hippocampal neurons were activated, pointing to a clear link between light movement and improved brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurochemical Surge:&lt;/strong&gt; Light exercise increases dopamine and noradrenaline in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstem Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Activity in the VTA and locus coeruleus correlated with memory-related brain areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support light exercise as a powerful tool for enhancing brain plasticity and memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tsukuba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent studies have found that light exercise, such as light jogging and yoga, activate the hippocampus, thereby increasing the number of neurons and improving memory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the details of the mechanisms involved, the specific neural circuits activated in the brain during exercise, and the way they activate neurons in the hippocampus are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110099"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce.jpg" alt="This shows a person running and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus, even with light exercise. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin, collectively known as monoamines, are critical neurotransmitters that regulate neuronal activity and plasticity and are produced by neurons that cluster in the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monoamines transmitted to the hippocampus promote neuronal and synaptic plasticity, contributing to the regulation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this research team hypothesized that the monoaminergic system originating in the brainstem may contribute to hippocampal activation during light exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, this study established a rat treadmill running model that mimicked the physiological responses in human exercise to evaluate the effects of exercise at different intensities on hippocampal monoamine concentrations and the activation of brainstem monoaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus, even with light exercise.

"The most important action for preventing rabies is keeping pets up to date on their rabies vaccinations. It is important to avoid contact with wild or stray animals, and parents should be sure that their children are taught not to touch, pet, or otherwise handle unknown animals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/2-baby-giraffes-missing-from-the-natural-bridge-zoo-court-documents-gretchen-karl-mogensen-rockbridge-county-court-animal-law-unit-birth-transfer-may-2025#" target="_blank" title="https://wset.com/news/local/2-baby-giraffes-missing-from-the-natural-bridge-zoo-court-documents-gretchen-karl-mogensen-rockbridge-county-court-animal-law-unit-birth-transfer-may-2025#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Two baby giraffes missing from the Natural Bridge Zoo: court documents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVHD lists the following steps to take:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not handle sick, injured or dead animals. Contact a licensed wildlife rehabber if you have concerns about sick or injured wildlife&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep wild animals out of homes by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight fitting lids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not try to trap or handle stray and wild animals. If a bat is found indoors and may have had contact with someone, do not release it. Call your local animal control officer or health department to determine if the animal should be picked up and tested for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report all bites to people to the local health department for investigation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about rabies, click &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/animal-contact-human-health/rabies-control/" target="_blank" title="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/animal-contact-human-health/rabies-control/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSET</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 14:04:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPQnh6OTdPVEtXc2ZkR2psQWVpQXhfdHFncjgzU0pWNGVKRFFRZGxHcHI2aGdmX3VabVlXZ0RiNEI5NHNJMzFlZHVPWGZ6X1NZOExuQUV5VXFnX1NkT1oxY2Z0OHMwUERibHBiaEV3aGVnaDFPamJBREg4MkItQzFsYWpnenpibUJUdF9aa290S1Y3Q3IzOG5KOEJXd21yX1g2VkphTnNkQWI5dWZqWUZ5MHl0SV8</guid></item><item><title>音乐如何在情感上重塑您的记忆-神经科学新闻 | How Music Can Emotionally Reshape Your Memories - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpeDFqYl9vRmVOZFN0MTZWNDVZX2sycC0wN2xUbnVfZ2lpTEkwa2ZNZXB2OWtPZzBzcWtKRkN4Ylpkc2MwLXhQLVhvc1BIT2Fhc2Jqc1htQ3kxaGdjcTZDUjV2amFXMVBmX0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new neuroscience study reveals that music can alter the emotional content of our memories when played during recollection. Participants who listened to emotionally charged music while recalling neutral stories later remembered those stories with emotional tones matching the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These emotional updates persisted over time, demonstrating that music can influence the emotional reconstruction of memory. Brain scans showed increased activity and connectivity in emotion- and memory-related regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, during music-paired recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Rewriting:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional music played during recollection altered the remembered emotional tone of otherwise neutral stories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; One day later, participants still recalled the stories with emotional content matching the music’s valence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; fMRI showed increased amygdala activity and connectivity with frontal and visual areas during emotional music recollection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music doesn’t just move us—it may also reshape the emotions we associate with past experiences, according to a new neuroscience study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that playing emotional music during memory recollection can subtly alter the content of that memory, effectively updating its emotional tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes aren’t just fleeting impressions; they can persist for days and are reflected in the brain’s emotional and memory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the well-established theory that memories can be updated each time they are retrieved, scientists designed a three-day experiment to explore how music might influence this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first encoded emotionally neutral stories. Later, they were asked to recall those stories while listening to either emotionally positive or negative music. Finally, they were tested again a day later, without music, to see how their memories had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Participants who recalled stories while listening to emotional music were significantly more likely to infuse their recollections with new emotional content that matched the tone of the music—happy music led to more positive reinterpretations, while sad music prompted more negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tested a day later, these emotional distortions had persisted, showing that music had effectively rewritten the emotional tone of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging during recollection showed activity in emotion- and memory-related regions, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and inferior parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, emotional music increased connectivity between the amygdala and both the frontal cortex and visual processing areas, suggesting that the brain was integrating emotional tone with visual imagery and narrative structure during recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed new light on the powerful influence of music on the mind. While music’s ability to evoke emotional responses is well known, this study shows it can actively change what we remember and how we feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has potential implications for everything from therapeutic memory reconsolidation to understanding the emotional coloring of autobiographical memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re reminiscing to a nostalgic playlist or reliving heartbreak through song, your soundtrack may be shaping your memories more than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and emotional memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01200-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Affective music during episodic memory recollection modulates subsequent false emotional memory traces: an fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;” by Yiren Ren et al. &lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affective music during episodic memory recollection modulates subsequent false emotional memory traces: an fMRI study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is a powerful medium that influences our emotions and memories. Neuroscience research has demonstrated music’s ability to engage brain regions associated with emotion, reward, motivation, and autobiographical memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While music’s role in modulating emotions has been explored extensively, our study investigates whether music can alter the emotional content of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the theory that memories can be updated upon retrieval, we tested whether introducing emotional music during memory recollection might introduce false emotional elements into the original memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a 3-day episodic memory task with separate encoding, recollection, and retrieval phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our primary hypothesis was that emotional music played during memory recollection would increase the likelihood of introducing novel emotional components into the original memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral findings revealed two key outcomes: 1) participants exposed to music during memory recollection were more likely to incorporate novel emotional components congruent with the paired music valence, and 2) memories retrieved 1 day later exhibited a stronger emotional tone than the original memory, congruent with the valence of the music paired during the previous day’s recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, fMRI results revealed altered neural engagement during story recollection with music, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and inferior parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and other brain regions, including the frontal and visual cortex, was observed during recollection with music, potentially contributing to more emotionally charged story reconstructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate the interplay between music, emotion, and memory, offering insights into the consequences of infusing emotional music into memory recollection processes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 13:57:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpeDFqYl9vRmVOZFN0MTZWNDVZX2sycC0wN2xUbnVfZ2lpTEkwa2ZNZXB2OWtPZzBzcWtKRkN4Ylpkc2MwLXhQLVhvc1BIT2Fhc2Jqc1htQ3kxaGdjcTZDUjV2amFXMVBmX0E</guid></item><item><title>长时间坐着可能会缩小大脑-神经科学新闻 | Sitting for Hours May Shrink the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5JNzRpb2JjN0RqZ3VCVFJVZjhBQ1c1YmxCNzloODJTZzBvWTk4RWI4VUQzZDdPUzBDVVlydTdxd2p0aF9jQmZvTWtVSmRKWmVha0RZNFRlcHBOS1N4Z3Z3MFE1Wmx0ZEdxM3dudFpVWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Prolonged sedentary behavior in adults over 50 is linked to cognitive decline and brain shrinkage in regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. Even among those who exercise regularly, spending more time sitting was associated with worse cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was strongest in individuals carrying the APOE-e4 gene, a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research study was led by Marissa Gogniat, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Pitt and former postdoctoral fellow at the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, and co-authored by Angela Jefferson, PhD, professor of Neurology and founding director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center at VUMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team of researchers examined the relationship between sedentary behavior and neurodegeneration among 404 adults age 50 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants wore a watch that measured their activity continuously over the span of a week. Their sedentary time was then related to their cognitive performance and brain scans captured over a seven-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who spent more time sedentary were more likely to experience cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes regardless of how much they exercised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions were stronger in participants who carried the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;APOE-e4&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day,” said Gogniat. “Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age,” said Jefferson, who holds the Herbert O. and Vineta Christopher Directorship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study showed that reducing sitting time could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Alzheimer’s Association and the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sedentary behavior and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a0b1a2aaa4eda1aca6b1ada6b183b5b6aea0edacb1a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Boerner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vumc.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Boerner – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Increased sedentary behavior is associated with neurodegeneration and worse cognition in older adults over a 7-year period despite high levels of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;” by Marissa Gogniat et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sedentary behavior is associated with neurodegeneration and worse cognition in older adults over a 7-year period despite high levels of physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70157-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedentary behavior may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

			&lt;p&gt;New research has shown how the parasitic amoeba &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"&gt;Entamoeba histolytica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; takes bites from your cells to use as a disguise, hiding them from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entering the body via contaminated food or water, most infections from the parasite cause diarrhea, if any symptoms at all. In particularly bad cases, the amoeba can spread via the bloodstream to other vital organs, where it can cause serious problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the infection reaches the liver, for instance, the amoebic abscesses it creates can be fatal, causing complications that claim the lives of almost 70,000 people each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;this tiny monster wreaks such havoc in its host was largely unknown, until microbiologist Katherine Ralston – currently at the University of California Davis, but back then posted at the University of Virginia – investigated the amoeba more closely in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The going theory was that &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;injected a poison into its victim cells. But Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13242"&gt;saw something very different&lt;/a&gt; going on through her microscope. &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;was taking what looked like actual bites out of human cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To devise new therapies or vaccines, you really need to know how &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica&lt;/em&gt; damages tissue," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You could see little parts of the human cell being broken off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranger still, the amoeba &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03163-21"&gt;seemed satisfied&lt;/a&gt; with just a few chomps from each cell's membrane before moving on to its next victim, leaving in its wake a slew of half-chewed cells with cytoplasms oozing from their puncture wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It can kill anything you throw at it, any kind of human cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. It can even take a chomp out of the white blood cells that are meant to swallow such intruders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Amebiasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg" alt="diagram shows amebiases life cycle involves mature cysts ingested, entering intestine and possibly other parts of the body, and then cysts and trophozyoites are passed in feces.

Cysts can survive days to weeks in the external environment and remain infectious in the environment due to the protection conferred by their walls. (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/amebiasis/index.html"&gt;DPDx/CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Ralston and her colleagues &lt;span&gt;Maura Ruyechan and Wesley Huang have discovered t&lt;/span&gt;his seemingly wasteful habit actually allows &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica&lt;/em&gt; to gather outer membrane proteins from the human cells, which it proceeds to arrange on the surface of its own body for protection against defences in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this disguise doesn't just protect it from human immune 'guards': it works on immune responses present in the blood of other species, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has become clear that amoebae kill human cells by performing cell nibbling, known as trogocytosis," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;. "After performing trogocytosis, amoebae display human proteins on their own surface and are resistant to lysis [rupture] by human serum [a component of blood]."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This molecular disguise prevents our immune system from launching an attack on the amoeba by presenting chemical tags that identify it as safe, a bit like stealing the ID off a security guard. When &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;dons the human proteins CD46 and CD55, it can safely scoot past the &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'complement proteins' tasked with tracking down and destroying foreign cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This allows it to continue chomping away, forming abscesses full of liquified cells in the organs it inhabits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the team conducted an experiment in which they allowed the amoeba to collect material from human cells before exposing the 'disguised' parasites to mouse blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although mice are not a natural host of &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica,&lt;/em&gt; experimental infection of mice with amoebae mimics many aspects of the human infection, ranging from immune responses to the host genetic determinants of susceptibility to infection," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its camouflage was effective despite originating from an entirely different species, reflecting similarities between human and mouse complement protein security systems. This knowledge will allow the researchers to further investigate treatments and vaccines for the amoeba using mouse models, before proceeding to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science is a process of building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You have to build one tool upon another, until you're finally ready to discover new treatments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has not yet been peer-reviewed, but it is available as a pre-print in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every new “surprise” – from not being able to use tampons, to an almost constant cycle of UTIs – felt all the worse for my lack of mental and practical preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This shouldn’t be the case: around a half of all women will have some degree of pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. There are four types: vaginal, uterine, bladder and rectal, all of which involve one or more pelvic organs descending into the vagina. Often, it creates an internal bulge, but when it is more progressed it can be externally visible too. Prolapse being so varied – and, crucially, understudied – makes for a great proliferation of potential symptoms which are, in my opinion, generally underplayed in healthcare literature. Living with an organ descending into your vagina is frequently described as “uncomfortable”, as though comparable to wearing a too small pair of jeans. The NHS website describes what can be truly debilitating stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as “&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;problems [with] peeing&lt;/a&gt;”. What little information is available on prolapse seems designed to remind you that what you’re experiencing &lt;em&gt;is no big deal! &lt;/em&gt;But for many of us, that is far from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","type":"Keyword","title":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","type":"Keyword","title":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/childbirth","type":"Keyword","title":"Childbirth"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/may/18/the-private-pain-of-prolapse-six-things-i-wish-id-known-from-sex-to-exercise-to-mental-health","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My own prolapse was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;caused by childbirth&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also be brought on by injury, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, age, or for simply no (as yet known by medical research) reason at all. You might have none of the symptoms and no idea you even have it; conversely, you might have all of the symptoms and yet struggle to get a diagnosis. Six years on and, while I have a general diagnosis of “pelvic organ prolapse”, I do not know &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; prolapse I have, to what degree or whether or not I have multiple prolapses. Though I’m far from content with this shocking lack of information about my condition, I – through necessity – focus on what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know, to get through the day. Here is everything I have learned, and everything I wish I had already known about living with pelvic organ prolapse, before I had to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="penetrative-sex-will-be-different" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Penetrative sex &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t think about the effect it might have on my sex life. But, as it turns out, this is probably the area of my life that’s been most negatively affected. Yes, I have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – but when is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to lose control of your bladder? Yes, I have pain in my vagina – but when is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to feel pain in your vagina? At 29, and after a couple of nightmarish attempts at intercourse, I thought I’d never be able to have penetrative sex again; the pain was more than I could bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With time, however, I realised that positioning was key. Having sex on my side so that the penis would not penetrate so deeply made a huge difference. Of course, this is no good if you get off on deeper penetration – for this, a friend advises placing a cushion under your bum, to lift your pelvis up and cause your cervix to recede. We both agree that lube is a huge help in encouraging the penis to “find the path of least resistance”. And as for the SUI? I pee beforehand, even if I don’t think I really need to. For others who may be embarrassed about losing control of their bladder, I’d recommend having sex in the bath or lubed up to the nines – both blessedly simple ways to disguise bigger or smaller leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="-and-so-will-your-period" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;… and so will your period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While prolapse shouldn’t affect your period, your period &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;affect your prolapse. I certainly notice an increased heaviness in my vagina and, in the days before my period arrives, I feel particularly reluctant to overexert myself physically. I now experience cramping more intensely in my vagina, perhaps due to the descent of my uterus, and I have to apply heat pads to my vulva rather than abdomen (over clothing, to prevent the risk of burns). I have found using tampons and Mooncups next to impossible; my prolapse simply squeezes them out almost as soon as I insert them. Returning to pads after a decade of not using them was disheartening for me personally, and I have yet to find a brand of period pants I can get on board with. All of this caused me to turn to the coil – which has, at least, helped to alleviate my physical symptoms. It’s not for everyone, though, and while I did not experience pain with insertion myself, I would recommend anyone concerned about this to ask their healthcare provider to use a local anaesthetic gel or spray (pain relief is not routinely offered for IUD fittings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-relationship-to-exercise-will-change" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Your relationship to exercise will change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These days, it is generally only in the lead-up to my period, or after some particularly physical exertion, that my prolapse affects my mobility – but this was not the case for the first year or two. On the worst days, merely standing up felt like a monumental effort – I’d have to squeeze my pelvic floor muscles as hard as I could to combat the sense that my cervix was going to tumble out of me. Physiotherapists told me I shouldn’t pick up my baby– almost laughably impossible advice for a new parent – which left me questioning every cuddle. Friends who like to run took news of their prolapses particularly hard. One found herself unable to run 10 metres without losing full control of her bladder; incontinence pads were a gamechanger, once she was able to get past the stigma. Another option is a pessary – a small ring inserted into the vagina to help support the organs above it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-may-have-more-gynaecological-infections" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;You may have more gynaecological infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A risk that comes with pessary use, however, is the increased chance of vaginal infections. This is due to the pessary potentially introducing bacteria into the vagina, but prolapse in general is likely to increase infections. UTIs are the most common, as the descended organs can prevent the complete emptying of the bladder, or create small leaks and pooling of urine, which is a breeding ground for bacteria. After penetrative sex, residual semen can become trapped in the pockets created by the prolapse, also creating fertile ground for infection. It may seem that the answer to these problems is more rigorous hygiene standards, but introducing harsher products and rougher cleaning habits can actually have an adverse effect on the vaginal ecosystem. I have yet to come up with a better solution than regularly purchasing over-the-counter vaginal self-testing kits and requesting targeted medication from my GP, if needed. This is time consuming and expensive, and I hope that GPs will consider offering free self-testing kits for regularly occurring gynaecological infections in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-may-affect-your-future-fertility-options" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;It may affect your future fertility options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of healthcare professionals informed me that if I don’t want my prolapse to get any worse, I should not get pregnant again. Avoiding vaginal birth by having a caesarean section wouldn’t help, in my case, as the pressure put on my pelvic region by carrying another baby could be enough to greatly worsen my symptoms and future outlook. Surgical repair will only be offered to me once I’ve decided not to get pregnant again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to note that not all sufferers of prolapse are told that they should not become pregnant: it is judged on a case-by-case basis, and if you are prepared for your prolapse to potentially worsen then, of course, you can always go ahead with it, no matter what you are advised. But having to calculate that risk can be difficult for many. There is growing evidence to suggest that pessary use in pregnancy for those with advanced prolapse can lead to best post-birth outcomes, but more research into this and other interventions is sorely needed in order to provide as much reproductive choice as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-mental-toll-can-feel-impossible-but-it-isnt" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;The mental toll can feel impossible – but it isn’t&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t want to leave my bed. Partly, this was because every step I took felt like it was making things physically, medically, worse. But mostly, it was because of the mental toll that having a prolapse had taken on me. Doctors seemed to barely understand my condition, and shrouded it in euphemisms. I had little idea what the rest of my life was going to look like, and I suddenly – after having a baby – felt entirely alienated from my body and the child I was advised not to pick up. This is, of course, fertile grounds for postnatal depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another demographic affected by pelvic organ prolapse are those experiencing menopause – people who, like those who have just given birth, are subject to vast hormonal fluctuations and are therefore more vulnerable to poor mental health. Understanding the psychological impact that gynaecological conditions can have must begin with understanding a key element of medical misogyny: that women’s health conditions are almost universally &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;understudied, undertreated, and underdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. Women find themselves experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.iasp-pain.org/advocacy/global-year/pain-in-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more pain, and with less likelihood of diagnosis and treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can feel frustrating, like the system is stacked against us. But it is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat; to campaign for better treatment options, and to work together to destigmatise conditions that are not talked about enough. Sharing my prolapse story with others, and then having so many people share their experiences with me, helped me to shed the shame I had initially felt at my body’s betrayal. Talking about how to achieve better sex, or how to manage my period, gave me a toolkit with which to move forward. We still need meaningful, institutional reform but, for now, I’m grateful not to be too ashamed to wear an incontinence pad if I need to.

Using brain scans from a diverse population sample, researchers found that poor blood sugar control may contribute to this structural brain change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were seen in Hispanic participants, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions to manage diabetes and protect brain health. The findings suggest that effective diabetes treatment could play a critical role in preserving cognitive function as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; T2DM is linked to cortical thinning in key cognitive regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycemic Control Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor blood sugar regulation appears to drive these changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Disparities:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were strongest in Hispanic participants, showing variation by ethnicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new USC-led study has uncovered a significant link between type 2 diabetes mellitus and cortical thickness in older adults from various populations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC’s Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI), the University of North Texas Health Science Center, and the University of Texas at Austin have just published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment &amp;amp; Disease Monitoring&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110087"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-thinning-diabetes-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Given the rising prevalence of diabetes, particularly among minority populations, these results underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve diabetes management and mitigate its neurological consequences.

If left uncontrolled, it can lead to serious health problems affecting the circulatory, nervous, and immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that individuals with T2DM exhibited a significantly thinner cortex, particularly in the temporal and parietal regions of the brain, which are critical for memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers utilized advanced neuroimaging techniques to analyze cortical thickness and hippocampal volume in participants from the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD) cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s diverse sample, comprising Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic white adults, provides critical insights into how diabetes affects brain health across different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found poor glycemic control may be a key driver of the observed association between T2DM and cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Since blood sugar levels can be managed with proper treatment and lifestyle interventions, our findings highlight the potential for protecting brain health through better diabetes management,” says Amaryllis A. Tsiknia, the PhD student who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the association between T2DM and cortical thinning remained strong even after accounting for socioeconomic factors and common comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Hispanic participants showed the strongest associations, while no significant effects were observed among non-Hispanic Black adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the rising prevalence of diabetes, particularly among minority populations, these results underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve diabetes management and mitigate its neurological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The disparities we observed by ethnic and racial group suggest that more work is needed to understand how exposures to various risk factors can work together in distinct ways across different people to determine brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gaining this understanding is the first step in advancing personalized care that best protects the brain and cognition for each individual,” explained senior author Meredith N. Braskie, PhD, assistant professor of neurology, and a HABS-HD co-lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study and its results highlight the significant role of large-scale initiatives like HABS-HD, which is the most comprehensive study of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HABS-HD provides invaluable data, including interviews, functional exams, blood draws, cognitive testing, brain MRIs, and clinical lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This data can lead to significant discoveries, such as this study’s link between type 2 diabetes and cortical thickness, underscoring the importance of the large-scale and global initiatives we specialize in at the Stevens INI,” said Stevens INI director Arthur W. Toga, PhD, who also serves as the neuroimaging and informatics lead for the HABS-HD study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team anticipates longitudinal studies to determine if the observed brain changes result in accelerated cognitive decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies exploring the effects of diabetes medications and lifestyle interventions could aid in identifying strategies to protect brain health in individuals with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can receive more information about accessing HABS-HD data &lt;a href="https://www.gaaindata.org/partner/HABS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (S10OD032285) and the National Institute on Aging (R01AG054073, R01AG058533, R01AG070862, P41EB015922, U19AG078109).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors on the study include Amaryllis A.

We examined T2DM associations with cortical thickness and hippocampal volume in ethnoracially diverse, cognitively unimpaired older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dad270088-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2171 cognitively unimpaired older adults, we examined (1) how T2DM related to cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, (2) whether associations were independent of socioeconomic factors and comorbidities, (3) whether associations were driven by hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia, and (4) how associations varied by self-reported race/ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dad270088-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2DM was correlated with thinner cortex independent of socioeconomic factors and comorbidities, and this was driven by higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Higher HbA1c levels were correlated with thinner cortex in diabetics and non-diabetics. T2DM–cortical thickness associations were strong and widespread in Hispanic participants, modest and limited to temporal regions in non-Hispanic White participants, and not present in non-Hispanic Black adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dad270088-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2DM is associated with a thinner cortex, and this is driven by poor glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 12:58:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE8yR2V0bkNFRG9uS3haM2dRVVdycDJZNUNPZ0JiVjZxWXN0WVQ4ZDRSdU1IblJqUEw2MUFWV0IwYnA5ZWVORmgyOTZrZW9hc1c0Q1dZc2VCR1BKUDBQTVBKY1hBaWhhVndXTmJV</guid></item><item><title>父母的年龄、血统和习惯塑造新的DNA突变-神经科学新闻 | Parents’ Age, Ancestry, and Habits Shape New DNA Mutations - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1LcnBKeUN0Mnk2ajBPQUtMM3NTUlc2UVBGRGZFaGt6eHp2WmtEcW9NaGZWQkxYRWZVY09kdTdpclJvcTIzdVBJXzVSYkx1VW94a09Ea1RmNS1hX0VWSnlKN2tnRGh3V1ZpWkR4eURtVXN4STVyalpTRk9nTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A massive genomic study has revealed that parental age, ancestry, and smoking habits subtly influence the number of new genetic mutations (de novo mutations) passed from parents to children. By analyzing whole-genome data from 10,000 parent-child trios, researchers found that most variation in mutation rates comes from parental age, especially the father’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, small differences were also observed between ancestry groups and in children of parents with a smoking history. These findings challenge the assumption that mutation rates are uniform across populations and environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Dominates:&lt;/strong&gt; Paternal age adds ~1.5 mutations per year; maternal age adds ~0.4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancestry Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Slightly higher mutation rates seen in African ancestry groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Parental smoking linked to a ~2% increase in mutation count in offspring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wellcome Sanger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancestry and lifestyle choices of parents may affect the rate and type of new genetic changes that arise in their children, new research has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; (15 May), researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the University of Cambridge and their collaborators analysed whole-genome sequence data from 10,000 parent-child ‘trios’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied the influence of ancestry, common genetic variants and environmental factors on the rates and types of &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; mutations (DNMs) – genetic changes that arise in the egg or sperm and are passed down to offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110083"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and her kids, and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers note that it is too early to say whether parental smoking directly causes these new mutations, as it may just be associated with other mutagens. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on factors that influence the rate and patterns of new genetic variation in humans. The results will also inform future studies in population and medical genetics in which models of mutation rate are important parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germ cells – eggs and sperm – maintain integrity of genetic information which is passed down to children. While most new changes occurring in the DNA tend to be either harmless or mildly detrimental, a small fraction can lead to severe genetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the mutation rate in germ cells is kept exceptionally low to reduce the risk of passing on harmful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst scientists know that increasing parental age – particularly paternal age – is linked with more genetic changes in germ cells, this factor only explains a certain amount of variation in mutation rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from effects of chemotherapy and rare variants in genes involved in DNA repair, little is known about other factors influencing the rate of DNMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers sought to explore the influence of ancestry, common genetic variants and smoking on rates and patterns of DNMs that arise in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted the largest study of DNMs to date, analysing around 10,000 whole genomes of parent-child ‘trios’ – two parents and their child – from the 100,000 Genomes Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing each child’s DNA with that of their parents, the scientists could identify new genetic variants that arose in the egg or sperm and were passed on to the child, but which were not present in the parents’ genomes. This approach allowed the team to build a catalogue of nearly 690,000 DNMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that different ancestry groups have small differences in the number of new genetic mutations passed to children – for example, there was an average of about 64 new DNMs per generation in European, American, and South Asian groups, compared to about 67 in African groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, parental age, especially the father’s age, has a much bigger impact. Each year of a father’s age adds around 1.5 mutations, whereas each year of a mother’s age adds about 0.4. So, the difference between parents with African versus other genetic ancestries is about the same as having a father who is two years older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the differences could stem from environmental influences and/or genetic factors that differ between populations​.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they did not find any evidence that common genetic variation influences rates of DNMs within people of European ancestry, although this does not rule out that average genetic differences between ancestry groups contribute to differences in DNM rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also uncovered a link between parental smoking and higher DNM rates in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that children of parents who had documented smoking history in their health records showed a small but statistically significant increase in the number of DNMs, compared to children of non-smokers​. The analysis suggests an average of roughly two per cent rise in mutation count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is very small – the equivalent of less than one additional DNM per smoking parent over their reproductive lifespan, similar to the effect of having the father be a year older at the time of conception​.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that it is too early to say whether parental smoking directly &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; these new mutations, as it may just be associated with other mutagens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this study is a significant step forward in looking at how the genetic ancestry and lifestyle of parents correlate with rates of new genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may have an influence on future genetic studies on population history and dynamics, as well as studies seeking to identify genes implicated in rare disorders using DNMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies currently assume the same rate and pattern of DNA changes for all ancestry groups. It is possible that adjustments to current models to take into account these new findings may make them more powerful or help refine conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sheer scale of the 100,000 Genomes Project presented a great opportunity to look into the effects and exposures that explain rates and patterns of DNA changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The takeaway is that rates of &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; mutation are mostly driven by parental age, but ancestry and environmental factors such as smoking may make a small imprint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Aylwyn Scally,co-senior author at the University of Cambridge, commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whilst evolution has done its best to develop mechanisms to protect the DNA we pass on to our offspring, our study has shown that it’s not fully protected from certain exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future studies on larger datasets and with richer data on environmental exposures may reveal additional important factors that influence variation in &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; mutation rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Raheleh Rahbari,co-senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“New genetic changes that arise in egg or sperm cells give rise to genetic diversity within a population, making each one of us unique, but they can also cause rare genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, we’ve been able to see for the first time that a person’s ancestry and even lifestyle choices of their family, such as smoking, are associated with the number of new DNA changes that arise in their genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These effects are small, but nonetheless these findings increase our understanding of factors associated with this fundamental biological process,” said Dr Hilary Martin,co-senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research and NHS England who fund The National Genomic Research library.

Researchers found that a single dose of amphetamine disrupted mice’s ability to judge time accurately by altering how neurons in the prefrontal cortex represent time. The findings suggest that amphetamine impairs cognitive functions by increasing the variability of neural signals that encode time, a core component of decision-making and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamine is a powerful stimulant that increases levels of chemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. While it can temporarily enhance focus or alertness, it also has well-documented side effects, especially when taken in high doses or without medical supervision. One area of concern is its effect on executive functions—higher-order processes that include planning, attention, and self-control. The prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in these functions, has been shown to be especially sensitive to changes in dopamine levels, which are significantly affected by amphetamine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by Matthew Weber and &lt;a href="https://narayanan.lab.uiowa.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Nandakumar Narayanan&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Iowa, sought to better understand how amphetamine affects brain activity during tasks requiring executive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Amphetamine is a commonly abused drug that causes dopamine to be released from neurons and prevents reuptake of dopamine. We know that amphetamine can have a huge impact on cognitive function, but it is unknown why or how. We conducted this study to investigate basic mechanisms of how amphetamine affects cognitive function,” said Narayanan, Juanita J. Bartlett Professor and director of the Center for Neurodegeneration at the University of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers turned to interval timing—a behavioral task in which animals must estimate time intervals of several seconds to earn a reward. Interval timing is widely used in both animal and human research because it depends on the prefrontal cortex and requires attention and working memory. Importantly, this task provides a way to measure not only how accurate a subject is in judging time but also how consistent their judgments are from trial to trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team approached this question in two parts. First, they conducted a meta-analysis of 15 previously published rodent studies on amphetamine and interval timing. They found that amphetamine had a significant effect on timing precision, making animals’ estimates of time more variable. While it also had an effect on timing accuracy—whether the timing was generally early or late—the impact on variability was stronger. These findings established a reliable link between amphetamine use and disrupted temporal judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team conducted their own experiment using mice trained on a well-established version of the interval timing task. The mice were taught to switch between two response ports based on how much time had passed, with rewards given for correct timing. After several weeks of training, the researchers implanted electrodes in the mice’s prefrontal cortex to monitor the activity of individual neurons during the task. On the first day, the mice received a saline injection before the task, serving as a baseline. On the second day, they were given an injection of amphetamine before performing the same task again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, the mice showed increased variability in their timing after receiving amphetamine. Although their average timing shifted slightly earlier, the more noticeable effect was the inconsistency in when they made their decisions. This change echoed the results of the earlier meta-analysis and suggested that amphetamine made it harder for the mice to maintain steady estimates of time across trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the neural level, the researchers focused on patterns of activity known as “ramping”—gradual changes in firing rates of neurons that occur during the timed interval. This kind of activity is thought to reflect how the brain keeps track of time. Under normal conditions, many prefrontal neurons show a steady increase or decrease in activity during the interval. However, after amphetamine was administered, this ramping activity became significantly more variable. The average rate of firing didn’t change, but the consistency of the ramping pattern from trial to trial did. This suggests that the brain’s internal clock was no longer functioning reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We guessed that amphetamine would impair brain function, but we were surprised that amphetamine disrupted how these neurons work together,” Narayanan told PsyPost. “We can measure how neurons work together and found that amphetamine weakened these interactions. This provides fresh insight into how neurons in the prefrontal cortex cooperate and how amphetamine degrades this cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the coordination between neurons was weakened after amphetamine exposure. Neurons that normally showed synchronized activity during the task became less functionally connected. Using joint activity measurements between pairs of neurons, the researchers showed that the cooperative firing patterns seen under normal conditions were diminished when the drug was introduced. These weakened interactions may reflect a breakdown in the neural networks that support complex timing and decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding involved low-frequency brain rhythms in the 2–5 Hz range, often linked to cognitive control and attention. These oscillations were noticeably reduced in the prefrontal cortex after amphetamine administration. Prior research has suggested that such brain rhythms play an important role in organizing neural activity during tasks that require sustained focus or timing. Their disruption may further explain the loss of precision observed in the behavioral data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that amphetamine affects how the brain processes time by disrupting the consistency and coordination of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. The effects were observed after a single dose of the drug, indicating that even acute exposure can interfere with core aspects of executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on a simple cognitive behavior—timing intervals of a few seconds, which helps guide our everyday interactions with the world,” Narayanan explained. “Our study, which was in rodents and focused on the prefrontal cortex, offers a unique glimpse into how amphetamine affects this cognitive behavior. We believe that this is relevant for understanding drugs of abuse, treatments, and also diseases like Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia that involve dopamine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, there are limitations to consider. First, while the dose used was consistent with previous studies, it reflects the higher end of the range used in rodent research and may not correspond precisely to typical human use. Second, the drug was administered systemically, affecting the entire brain. Although the researchers focused on the prefrontal cortex, amphetamine also impacts other regions such as the striatum, which is involved in timing accuracy. Future research will be needed to isolate the specific contributions of different brain areas and neurotransmitter systems to the observed behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study only examined the effects of a single dose. It is still unclear how repeated or chronic use of amphetamine might influence temporal processing and neural coordination over time. The researchers suggest that future studies could combine this type of neural recording with techniques that allow more precise manipulation of brain circuits, such as optogenetics, to better understand the causal relationship between neuronal variability and timing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was in rodents, so we have to be careful when translating our results to humans,” Narayanan noted. “However, the reason that we study timing behavior is that all mammals, from rodents to humans, have similar brain processes that help guide our actions in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Amphetamine is a complex drug that affects many different regions of the brain. We are studying how other brain areas are involved and developing much more specific methods to investigate how amphetamine affects cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to learn how dopamine affects the neural circuitry of cognition,” Narayanan added. “Through hard work and rigorous science, this knowledge will lead to new biomarkers, and maybe even new treatments for diseases that impair cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only way we develop new knowledge like this is through careful and rigorous science—we’d like to thank the American public and the National Institutes of Health for funding this work. We hope to keep working on this problem to come up with a better understanding of, and better treatments for, amphetamine addiction, ADHD, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2025.110486" target="_blank"&gt;Amphetamine increases timing variability by degrading prefrontal temporal encoding&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Matthew A.

&lt;p&gt;A virus largely unknown outside scientific circles is spreading rapidly across parts of &lt;strong&gt;Latin America&lt;/strong&gt;, drawing comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Zika&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dengue&lt;/em&gt; and prompting concern from epidemiologists. Known as the &lt;strong&gt;oropouche virus&lt;/strong&gt;, it has already infected over &lt;strong&gt;20,000 people&lt;/strong&gt; in the region since late 2023, with confirmed cases across &lt;strong&gt;Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Caribbean&lt;/strong&gt;. The virus, first documented in &lt;strong&gt;1955&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/em&gt;, is now being watched closely by international health researchers who warn of its “massively under-diagnosed” presence in tropical regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Virus Mistaken for Zika or Dengue for Decades&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus symptoms are frequently mistaken for those of &lt;em&gt;dengue&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Zika&lt;/em&gt;, leading to widespread underreporting. Patients often present with &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/this-ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-making-it-deadlier-than-ever-before/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="89396" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, chills, nausea, vomiting,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;skin rashes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While many recover, some develop more serious conditions such as &lt;strong&gt;viral meningitis&lt;/strong&gt;, a brain infection that can result in severe complications. Because the symptoms are so similar to those of other mosquito-borne diseases, misdiagnosis is common and has masked the virus’s true spread for years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent findings by a team at &lt;strong&gt;Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin&lt;/strong&gt;, led by &lt;strong&gt;Professor Jan Felix Drexler&lt;/strong&gt;, have shown that oropouche virus infections are far more widespread than previously believed. In a study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00110-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Drexler’s team analyzed over &lt;strong&gt;9,400 blood samples&lt;/strong&gt; collected in &lt;strong&gt;Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Peru&lt;/strong&gt; between 2001 and 2022. The presence of antibodies revealed that, across all regions, around &lt;strong&gt;6%&lt;/strong&gt; of people had been exposed to the virus. In parts of the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;, this number climbed to over &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Climate Change and El Niño Amplify the Spread&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current spread of oropouche virus appears to be driven largely by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/earths-arctic-region-flips-releasing-more-co%e2%82%82-than-it-absorbs-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77239" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;climatic conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly consistent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/discovery-atlantic-global-consequences/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="88252" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heat and rainfall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers believe that weather events like &lt;strong&gt;El Niño&lt;/strong&gt;, which increase humidity and temperatures across the tropics, have played a major role in creating ideal breeding conditions for the virus’s insect vectors. Unlike traditional mosquitoes, oropouche is spread by tiny biting midges known as &lt;strong&gt;Ceratopogonidae&lt;/strong&gt; — insects small enough to pass through conventional mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models used by Drexler’s team suggest that these climate conditions are the most significant contributors to the virus’s transmission patterns. The virus remains most prevalent in the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/strong&gt;, but high-risk zones have also been identified across &lt;strong&gt;Central America&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Caribbean&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;southern coastal Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;. People living in higher-altitude regions were found to be less affected, as the cooler temperatures reduce insect activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rising Risks for Pregnant Women&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers are now turning their attention to the virus’s potential impact on &lt;strong&gt;pregnant women&lt;/strong&gt;. Recent reports from affected countries include &lt;strong&gt;two deaths&lt;/strong&gt; of young, healthy women and &lt;strong&gt;several cases&lt;/strong&gt; where infection during pregnancy appeared to cause &lt;strong&gt;miscarriages&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;congenital malformations&lt;/strong&gt;. While Drexler notes that oropouche seems to harm unborn babies “less frequently than Zika,” the full extent of its effects remains unclear and needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“There is still relatively little known about the virus,” Drexler said, emphasizing the need for urgent research into how the virus affects fetal development. With no vaccine or specific treatment currently available, health experts are urging people in high-risk areas — especially women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant — to take strong precautions. These include wearing &lt;strong&gt;long-sleeved clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;insect repellents&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;em&gt;DEET&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;icaridin&lt;/em&gt;, and seeking medical advice before traveling to affected regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Insect Control Remains the Only Defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its growing prevalence, the oropouche virus remains without a &lt;strong&gt;licensed vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;approved antiviral treatment&lt;/strong&gt;. For now, protection hinges on preventing bites from the midges that carry the disease. Unlike the more widely known &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes, the midges that transmit oropouche are extremely small — often no larger than &lt;strong&gt;3 millimeters&lt;/strong&gt; — and are able to pass through many types of &lt;strong&gt;mosquito netting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of this, &lt;strong&gt;fine-mesh nets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;protective clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;repellents&lt;/strong&gt; are currently the only effective defenses. Drexler warns that as long as high infection rates persist and the virus remains poorly understood, the public — particularly in the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon basin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tropical lowlands&lt;/strong&gt; — should remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

In newborns, hospitalizations decreased by as much as 71%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Heather Auerbach, an emergency physician, noticed that trend, saying: “There was definitely less RSV this year compared to the last two to three years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The young children who did get sick enough to go to the emergency room often needed lower levels of care, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I think I saw fewer critically ill kids from it this year than I have the last couple of years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Even if the kids get sick and even if they wind up in the hospital, there’s a difference between just needing some suction and oxygen versus needing to be on high flow [oxygen] or BiPap or in the PICU or things like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Auerbach wishes her own family could have benefited from the RSV shots, sharing that her son was hospitalized with RSV in January 2020 when he was only three weeks old. He was born full-term with no complications, and then he got sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All of a sudden, his breathing had just gotten much worse,” Auerbach said. He was less alert and started using his stomach muscles to help him breathe – classic signs of respiratory complications with RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even when infants don’t show these signs, they are still at risk from RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Little babies with RSV can have periods of apnea where they stop breathing, and it can happen suddenly, even if they don’t have other symptoms,” Auerbach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her son was admitted to the hospital, and when he returned home, she and her husband, who is also a physician, needed to suction away mucus regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I wish the shot had been around then, but we were a few years too early,” Auerbach said. “I genuinely think that could have saved him a hospitalization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For parents, a child’s RSV hospitalization can be a wrenching time, full of uncertainty and fear. Hospital stays of any length are disruptive and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Kids get very, very sick from this” without vaccines and preventative treatments, and preventing any of that is a major breakthrough, Auerbach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She also wonders whether the shots could have prevented, even for a time, additional complications down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her son started wheezing a few months after his illness. He received an asthma diagnosis, which was “very early and unusual”. Auerbach, her husband and their son’s pulmonologist believe it was related to the RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no guarantee that he may not have ended up with [asthma] regardless. But do I think he would have had it at six months? No,” Auerbach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to one tool for tracking RSV hospitalizations, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/rsv-net.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;RSV-Net&lt;/a&gt;, the peak in hospitalizations for children under the age of one this year was roughly half of that at the height of the 2023-24 season, and one-third the peak of the 2022-23 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Such a dramatic decline only holds for these very young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children aged 1-4 and 5-17 had higher rates of hospitalization from RSV this winter compared with last winter, according to RSV-Net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Higher RSV hospitalization rates in older children – who are not eligible for RSV prevention products – suggest this season may have been more severe than previous seasons,” Jasmine Reed, a CDC spokesperson, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Notably, hospitalization rates in babies under three months old were half of previous seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, more young infants are hospitalized during worse RSV seasons. That hospitalization rates still “dropped markedly” among babies likely means the shots are working well, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It could mean the shots are working even better than the numbers indicate, because the drop in hospitalizations is occurring even amid a more severe season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These trends track with the new CDC study. Babies under eight months old had a decrease in RSV hospitalizations of 43%, according to RSV-Net, or 28%, according to the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers excluded Houston from NVSN data – the city saw an early RSV season before preventatives were widely available – that drop went from 28% to 56%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The biggest change happened among newborns under the age of two months – the most vulnerable group to RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In these very young babies, RSV hospitalization dropped by 52%, according to RSV-Net. The rate dropped by 45%, according to NVSN – but when Houston was excluded, the decrease was 71%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older children did not see the same benefit, indicating that the shots are behind the decrease, rather than a change in behavior, testing or transmission rates, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b838a10c-fa52-4502-a284-5027dd9914d6" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Trump health cuts create ‘real danger’ around disease outbreaks, workers warn","elementId":"b838a10c-fa52-4502-a284-5027dd9914d6","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/health-cuts-trump-disease-outbreaks"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children older than eight months, who were largely not eligible for the preventatives, were hospitalized at higher rates this winter compared with the same times in 2018–20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That means the significant drop in young infants’ hospitalizations now could be an underestimate, researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The monoclonal antibody treatment, nirsevimab, may be given to babies under eight months old either at birth, if they are born during RSV season, or as they enter winter. It is given to babies aged eight to 19 months old if they’re at high risk because of medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A vaccine for pregnant people, Pfizer’s Abrysvo, is offered in the third trimester during RSV season, which is usually between September and January. Those antibodies offer protection to newborns for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study shows how high uptake of the vaccines and preventative treatments “can lead to remarkable public health impact in protecting young babies from severe illness”, Reed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Increased use of RSV prevention products during future seasons might lead to even larger reductions in RSV hospitalizations among infants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 11:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQdjVTWWQwQVpfNk9jcFJaRjZubWVBWnQxbVRYNzZ3QlVGUFhuejg0OE90bWtmNWZpdmtwbHVaRjlYc3RmY0tNeUJZUVk5c0k1OVQyRmI1WWNjQXpVV1hPcEQ1XzNra2JRV25ydUFMZEZCZDMzdHhIdGphTUdZWVpsX3NDM25qZlhwUGZmYQ</guid></item><item><title>营养师分享一种令人惊讶的食物，可以在您生病时提供帮助- HuffPost | Dietitians Share A Surprising Food That Can Help When You’re Sick - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re confined to your bed with the flu or feeling annoyed about a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/persistent-cough-not-covid_l_656f1f74e4b0f3e5f44aca8f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cough that won’t go away" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264abee4b029d8a6109dc2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="656f1f74e4b0f3e5f44aca8f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cough that won’t go away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, you may be more intentional about incorporating health-promoting foods (the ones you can stomach, at least, when nausea is a symptom). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/foods-for-cold-and-flu-season_l_670bd26ae4b04266ae855350" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="best foods and drinks during cold and flu season" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264abee4b029d8a6109dc2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="670bd26ae4b04266ae855350" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;best foods and drinks during cold and flu season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are ones that likely come to mind first, like ginger and tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing that may come to mind is a dessert or something sweet.

The technique, called dynamic light scattering spectroscopy, measures microscopic protein movement in the retina and could offer a faster, cheaper, and more accessible way to screen for the disease in its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, a progressive neurological condition that gradually impairs memory, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities. It typically develops over many years, and by the time symptoms are obvious enough for a diagnosis, irreversible damage has often already occurred in the brain. That delay has made early detection a top priority in Alzheimer’s research, with hopes that identifying the disease sooner could allow for earlier interventions and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current ‘gold standard’ diagnostic method for Alzheimer’s disease is a PET scan. These are expensive, invasive, and uncomfortable for the patient, only to produce a qualitative reading that is accurate around 70% of the time in identifying the disease at a stage well beyond the point of any remedial action,” explained study author Jeffrey N. Weiss, the founder of &lt;a href="https://www.micronophthalmic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Micron Ophthalmic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was clear to me that something had to change. In my work as a physician and electrical engineer, I had employed dynamic light scattering spectroscopy and knew that it could be useful in providing a rapid, cost-effective, noninvasive, and quantitative measurement. Most impressively, we’ve seen that the technology is capable of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease at least two years earlier than any current method, opening the window for preventative care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic light scattering measures how proteins naturally move in the body—a type of motion known as Brownian movement. Since molecular changes often occur before physical damage or visible symptoms appear, Weiss believed dynamic light scattering spectroscopy could detect the earliest signals of Alzheimer’s disease. Because the retina develops from the same tissue as the brain during fetal development, it offers a unique and accessible window into neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Weiss developed a dynamic light scattering spectroscopy device that works in tandem with a standard ophthalmic fundus camera. During the procedure, a patient’s pupil is dilated using common eye drops. The patient then stares at a dim red light while the system collects data for just five seconds. Embedded software captures and analyzes the patterns of protein motion in the retina, producing an autocorrelation curve—a mathematical representation of molecular activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved several groups of participants. First, Weiss tested the reproducibility of the dynamic light scattering measurements by examining 17 healthy individuals with no history of neurological or eye disorders. The results were consistent across multiple variables, including sex, time of day, and whether the left or right eye was used. Importantly, the measurements were not affected by the participants’ age, suggesting that the test can reliably be used in older populations who are most at risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Weiss tested 15 individuals with mild cognitive impairment but no diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Of these, four participants showed a distinctive pattern in their results indicating slower protein motion. These individuals went on to receive a formal Alzheimer’s diagnosis six to twelve months later, supporting the idea that dynamic light scattering spectroscopy might detect the disease well before clinical symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included 17 individuals who had already been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease. Eleven of these participants had previously tested positive for amyloid buildup using PET scans. In all 11 cases, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy testing correctly identified the Alzheimer’s pattern. Of the remaining six, five were correctly classified as negative based on both PET and DLS results. One participant, who had a negative PET scan, showed a borderline DLS reading that may suggest very early changes missed by current imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key feature observed in the dynamic light scattering measurements was a flattening of the initial portion of the autocorrelation curve in patients with Alzheimer’s. This flattening reflects a slowing in the movement of retinal proteins, a signal that likely corresponds to early dysfunction in the retinal nerve fiber layer—an area known to be affected in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional eye imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, can also detect changes in this layer, but typically only after significant damage has occurred. In contrast, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy captures molecular-level changes that precede visible structural damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major advantage of dynamic light scattering spectroscopy over other diagnostic tools is its accessibility. The test is quick, noninvasive, and inexpensive—costing only a few cents to perform and requiring no disposable components. It could be used in community clinics, nursing homes, and low-resource settings where PET scans or spinal taps are impractical. Additionally, the technology avoids common confounding variables that affect optical coherence tomography, such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The retina is an outgrowth of the brain—it is important to acknowledge its growing relevance as an active observation site for biomarkers related to Alzheimer’s disease,” Weiss told PsyPost. “The test itself addresses many of the major issues in Alzheimer’s diagnostics: the complexity of testing in vulnerable populations, the cost-effectiveness of those tests, the elimination of ambiguity or subjectivity in the results, and most importantly, the stage at which we are able to identify the disease. In this regard, I hope that these findings suggest that there is hope in tackling what has previously felt impossible—treating the disease before there are symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the study has limitations. The sample sizes were small, and the research was conducted in a single setting. Although the test demonstrated strong predictive potential, larger studies across more diverse populations are needed to confirm its accuracy and reliability. Further work is also needed to determine whether eye diseases that affect the retina could interfere with dynamic light scattering measurements, even if the eye appears healthy during routine examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next milestone for this device is to build a sufficient body of evidence that our findings become irrefutable,” Weiss said. “For this, we need to place the machines in a variety of Alzheimer’s sites and assess the results that are generated. After this, the obvious next step is to engage with the FDA process, with the objective being to approve the device for wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a host of options from there, but one that looks particularly enticing in terms of creating a generational impact through this invention is to use it as an accompaniment for Alzheimer’s drug trials. It can collect far more data, at far shorter intervals, for a far lower cost than any other technology currently employed for this purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877241301802" target="_blank"&gt;Dynamic light scattering of the eye in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was published on November 25, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 10:15:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOS3VEbUloVjBWMHZlVkVSREZLeXdYdEYyMTEzRFdrMDRJSHBJeXktaEpXX1VjNkEyNGttdTAwckw4eEJtaU5ZXzZFOXR4bHJjR0Fkcy00a2MtQi1zZmJMMXAxRFJHeU50RmNkVWZmOUFnWVFIUnFwdTU1bDFLZ1AxYTVnb1Z1cElIWWNiXzZHNlZtbWhRQklSZ3BDbzVkY0NZX2NVaHdQTm5IMkdUbkNoWQ</guid></item><item><title>外科医生首次进行人膀胱移植-《纽约时报》 | Surgeons Perform First Human Bladder Transplant - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5KSHpCNTFTMUM4RmRRWkdyVjk5OGdRR3BmcU5CUUpQdGYzOU1VOVI3UjNocFlHTHZzM1FCYkppWUJJTF9XUm1EUUtvcUpOeDVZcGxUZ2xwU0dpZnVRazFkZGItRk1WeGc1M3l2bWdtdlo5ZFZEQ3k5UFZCaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, introducing a new, potentially life-changing procedure for people with debilitating bladder conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The operation was performed earlier this month by a pair of surgeons from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California on a 41-year-old man who had lost much of his bladder capacity from treatments for a rare form of bladder cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I was a ticking time bomb,” the patient, Oscar Larrainzar, said on Thursday during a follow-up appointment with his doctors. “But now I have hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The doctors plan to perform bladder transplants in four more patients as part of a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/clinical-trials/deceased-donor-bladder-or-combined-kidney-bladder" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of outcomes like bladder capacity and graft complications before pursuing a larger trial to expand its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/inderbir-singh-gill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Inderbir Gill&lt;/a&gt;, who performed the surgery along with &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/nima.nassiri" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nima Nassiri&lt;/a&gt;, called it “the realization of a dream” for treating thousands of patients with crippling pelvic pain, inflammation and recurrent infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There is no question: A potential door has been opened for these people that did not exist earlier,” said Dr. Gill, the chairman of the urology department at U.S.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

								&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Kurt started to experience things that hadn't bothered him before: dry skin, fatigue, irregular bowel movements and a white coating that formed over his tongue. For years, he saw both traditional doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/09/05/the_dark_side_of_alternative_medicine_and_holistic_healing_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;holistic medicine&lt;/a&gt; providers, who recommended or prescribed certain treatments to help him feel better. But he didn’t see much progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and find a solution, he started researching his symptoms online, where he came across a forum of people reporting their experiences with parasite cleanses. Soon after, he bought a 30-day protocol, marketed to rid the body of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/parasites" target="_blank"&gt;parasites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing was working,” Kurt, who is using his first name only for privacy reasons, told Salon in a phone interview. “I was kind of just willing to try anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parasite cleanses have been around for decades, but they have recently &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=parasite%20cleanse&amp;amp;t=1747162348188"&gt;surged in popularity on social media&lt;/a&gt;, with influencers and companies endorsing products or homemade solutions that promise to rid the body of harmful intestinal worms. Many doctors say the likelihood of having an intestinal parasite in the U.S. is relatively low and recommend people see a health care provider to get tested for a parasite if they think they have one rather than turning to online therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people report positive impacts when taking herbal supplements, these substances can come with side effects and contraindications just like pharmaceutical medications. Some of the ingredients included in these cleanses can be harmful when taken too frequently or at too large of a dose, and these formulations could also impact the natural balance of bacteria in the gut keeping us healthy. In any case, self-medicating with supplements online inherently carries its own risks, said Dr. Thomas Moore, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine at Wichita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If someone does have a parasite, there is actual medicine to address those parasites,” Moore told Salon in a phone interview. “There is no need to go on the internet for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prevalence of intestinal parasites in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of parasites have the ability to infect humans, including lice, mites and ticks. However, parasite cleanses typically promise to purge the body of intestinal parasites such as tapeworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If someone does have a parasite, there is actual medicine to address those parasites. There is no need to go on the internet for it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of intestinal parasites that have historically infected humans have been declining in prevalence and are currently rare in the United States, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893395223001229"&gt;Modern Pathology&lt;/a&gt;. Hookworms, for example, used to devastate communities in the South, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-a-worm-gave-the-south-a-bad-name/"&gt;by and large eradicated with the introduction of indoor plumbing and urbanization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, intestinal parasite infections do still occur in the U.S., and many &lt;a href="http://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/90/5/article-p783.xml" target="_blank"&gt;disproportionately affect people with reduced access to health care&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7847297/" target="_blank"&gt;those living in poverty&lt;/a&gt; or immigrant communities. Some of these parasites like the microscopic &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cryptosporidium&lt;/a&gt; — usually transmitted through water or food that has been contaminated with feces, including &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/12/23/why-conservatives-are-now-obsessed-with-raw-milk/" target="_blank"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt; — have become more common over the past decade, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of some of the more common intestinal parasite infections. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinworm/about/index.html"&gt;Pinworms&lt;/a&gt;, for example, cause itchiness in the anus and primarily spread between young children and their families, affecting &lt;a href="https://cchp.ucsf.edu/resources/illness-sheets/pinworms#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20five,re%2Dinfect%20a%20treated%20child."&gt;up to 15% of the population&lt;/a&gt; at any given time. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/giardia/about/index.html"&gt;Giardia&lt;/a&gt;, which causes diarrhea and can be acquired from drinking water from streams that has been contaminated, is estimated to affect &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-water-data/documentation/giardiasis-nndss-summary-report-for-2019.html#:~:text=Figure%201.,%E2%80%932019%20(N%20=%20158%2C344)&amp;amp;text=Since%202011%2C%20the%20incidence%20of,confirmed%20and%203.4%25%20nonconfirmed)."&gt;3.7% of the U.S. population&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other intestinal parasites can have more severe side effects. &lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides, &lt;/em&gt;a type of roundworm from pigs that has been reported in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25626125/" target="_blank"&gt;few cases&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38526329/" target="_blank"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, can cause issues with the lungs or growth problems in children in severe cases. However, there are medicines available to eradicate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, intestinal parasite infections are far more common in developing countries, where deworming practices are sometimes performed on populations that are exposed to high levels of contamination that put them at risk. But that is not the case in the states, where exposure to raw sewage or other things that can transmit intestinal parasites are comparably low, said Dr. Carlos Chaccour, a tropical disease researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S., which is highly urbanized and there are laws for sanitation, waste management, etc., the prevalence is substantially low,” Chaccour told Salon in a phone interview. “It’s definitely not a public health problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding out if you actually have a parasite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that someone is infected with a parasite, it’s important to get tested to identify which one it is, as each one has its own treatment protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people online say the tests used to diagnose parasites are inaccurate and prone to false negatives. While it is true that some infections could be missed in a single sample, the CDC recommends testing stool three times. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC85240/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of refugees in the U.S., for example, the first stool sample detected 80% of cases, the second increased the sensitivity to 92% and the third detected the remaining cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, other techniques are available to detect parasitic infections like blood tests, which vary based on the test but are generally even more accurate. One 2014 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24427320/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found many different versions of these tests accurately detected the parasites causing pinworm close to 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These cleansers often just encourage that. They irritate the stomach lining and encourage mucosal shedding, and to the untrained eye, it looks like a parasite."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosing parasites in your own stool can be tricky. For one, there are many different kinds that all look different, and evidence of parasitic infection can be excreted as parasitic larvae, which are microscopic. Some of the body’s natural processes can also mimic something that looks like an intestinal worm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some of these supplements can change stool in a way that makes it look like a parasite is being shed when it isn't, said Chris Brianik, a biologist who moderates a Reddit group about parasites where people commonly discuss cleanses. The intestines shed their lining periodically, which produces a mucus that can be visible in stool and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rope-worm#intestinal-mucus-theory"&gt;may be misidentified as a parasite,&lt;/a&gt; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two published &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6791610/#s3"&gt;case reports,&lt;/a&gt; two patients took the herbal supplement &lt;em&gt;Mimosa pudica&lt;/em&gt;, which they had read online could “cleanse” gut parasites. However, the report concluded that “this substance clumps together in stool, causing long, stringy structures to form,” which made the patients think they were passing worms when they were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cleansers often just encourage that,” Brianik said. “They irritate the stomach lining and encourage mucosal shedding, and to the untrained eye, it looks like a parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savina Bertollini, an herbalist in Marche, Italy, said she has worked with health care providers to treat people who were infected with a parasite while traveling. While some herbs have been effective in her experience, these supplements can cause side effects when taken long-term and are not “miracle pills,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertollini said she is skeptical of cleanses marketed for large numbers of people that are used in a “preventative” way without confirming that they have a parasite in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone might indeed need a parasite treatment,” Bertollini told Salon in an email. But for someone who does not know whether they have parasites and has not consulted with a health care professional, using a cleanse they bought because of an ad on social media or something similar "could create negative health consequences,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements are not without risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ingredients in things marketed as a parasite cleanse online may contain things like dietary fiber, which are unlikely to do harm, said Sebastian Lourido, a biology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if you are suffering from a real parasite infection, that is not going to help, and delaying treatment is probably going to be detrimental,” he told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parasite cleanses contain a wide range of ingredients depending on the product, and much of the information about how these supplements impact the body is anecdotal. One small study found &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17472487/"&gt;dried papaya seeds were associated with reduced intestinal parasites&lt;/a&gt; in Nigerian children. But the majority of studies looking at the effects of herbal supplements like these on parasites have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37230485/"&gt;conducted in test tubes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10392325/#s0002"&gt;culture dishes&lt;/a&gt; — not in humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to herbal supplements, however, some cleanses include &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/ivermectin" target="_blank"&gt;ivermectin&lt;/a&gt;, an antiparasitic drug used to treat river blindness and elephantitis, which leads to the painful enlargement of body parts. While ivermectin has saved millions of lives around the world from conditions like these, taking these drugs without having parasites or without a doctor to help guide dosing can be dangerous, Chaccour said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, ivermectin has been caught up in misinformation circulating online: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, inaccurate claims that it cured the virus spread on social media, and many began using animal formulations in an attempt to treat &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19#:~:text=Here's%20What%20You%20Need%20to,against%20COVID%2019%20in%20humans." target="_blank"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/the-monitor/covid-vaccine-concerns-and-claims-about-ivermectin-as-cancer-treatment-the-monitor/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/well/ivermectin-cancer-covid.html"&gt;concerns of misuse&lt;/a&gt;, legislation allowing ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter instead of requiring a prescription has recently &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/ivermectin-infection-treatment-prevention-wellness"&gt;passed in Idaho, Tennessee and Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore said ivermectin was not the panacea some are making it out to be and that it is not a benign drug in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All drugs have risks and benefits,” he said. “If you're taking any drug, regardless of what it is to treat something that you don't actually have, then you're taking all of the risk and you get none of the benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some substances in parasite cleanses may disrupt the microbiome: the balance of natural bacteria in the gut that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41231-021-00091-4" target="_blank"&gt;helps digest food and keep the body healthy&lt;/a&gt;, Lourido said. Although scientists are still uncovering how the balance of bacteria in the microbiome impacts the body, upsetting this balance in the gut has been associated with changes to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5695238/"&gt;immune and metabolic systems &lt;/a&gt;— and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384867/"&gt;even mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cleanses also recommend eating certain foods or restricting one’s diet, which could also disrupt this system. Alternatively, those dietary changes could also be behind some of the positive changes reported after a cleanse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you cause significant changes in the intestine, you are at times obliterating many of the beneficial organisms that are helping us digest food, but in some cases, producing vitamins that are actually occupying that niche and preventing bad organisms from taking over,” Lourido said. “All of those different functions … cease to occur correctly when we have diarrhea and we all of sudden make a dramatic change to eating only one kind of food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt’s cleanse contained black walnut, cloves and wormwood, along with a handful of other herbs. Most of the cleanse went by without him noticing any changes, but he started to have what he described as “a lot coming out of him in the bathroom” in the last week of it. Then, things took a dark turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme anxiety woke him up sweating in the middle of the night. His mental health changed for the worse, and he started to feel numb and anhedonic — things that used to make him happy no longer did. This went on for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least a year or two after, I was in really bad shape,” Kurt said. “I was wondering if I was ever going to be the same person that I was prior to doing this cleanse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt is not entirely sure whether he had a parasite or not, or how the supplements interacted with his system. But he does think they caused a major shift. He was excreting things he had never seen in his stool before and feeling things he had never felt before. Looking back, he thinks he overdid it and that his body was not ready for the supplements he was taking. To him, it seemed like his reaction was not typical compared to what he had seen others report online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, there are a lot of herbs out there and they are very powerful," he said. “I suppose that I will never really get answers as to what really happened because unfortunately, I never really knew what I was dealing with prior to this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplements are regulated for safety but not efficacy by the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This agency, along with the Federal Trade Commission, is in charge of monitoring companies to make sure what they're selling on the shelves matches what is being advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years after Kurt did his cleanse, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company that he bought it from, alleging the company mislabeled its supplements as medical treatments and did not contain enough information about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem with these parasitic cleansers is you don’t really know what is actually going on,” said Dr. Michael Schmidt, a microbiologist and immunologist at the MUSC Medical University of South Carolina. “In general, they come with ‘buyer beware’ attached.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of the parasite cleanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertollini, the herbalist, said she has seen a “dramatic upswing” in the popularity of these sorts of products in recent years, but that much of it seems to be based on people’s “fear of having parasites.” This fear makes evolutionary sense: Parasites aren't technically predators, but they can cause serious harm as they leech off of their hosts. (On the other hand, some parasites &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/10/31/parasites-are-the-bedrock-of-life-and-the-unifiy-its-time-to-give-them-the-respect-they-deserve/" target="_blank"&gt;can actually be beneficial&lt;/a&gt; — it depends on the species and the relationship with its host.) In one &lt;a href="https://source.washu.edu/2012/02/study-extends-the-ecology-of-fear-to-fear-of-parasites/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, raccoons and squirrels would sacrifice food to avoid tick-infested areas, suggesting that they valued the threat of parasites more than the promise of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ancient, justified fear could be the root of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541021/#:~:text=Epidemiology,Go%20to:"&gt;delusional parasitosis&lt;/a&gt;, a mental health condition in which people have psychological delusions that they have a parasite when they don't really. These folks may be particularly at risk of overconsuming cleansing products, Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, many people are turning to online treatments for various conditions because of a growing mistrust in the medical system and a lack of access to health care. Although it has a far lower rate of parasitic disease than other countries, the &lt;a href="https://www.factmr.com/report/4496/detox-products-market#:~:text=What%20is%20Propelling%20the%20Demand%20for%20Detox%20Products%20in%20the%20United%20States?&amp;amp;text=The%20market%20in%20the%20United,detox%20products%20in%20the%20U.S."&gt;U.S. is the biggest buyer of detox products,&lt;/a&gt; including parasite cleanses. At the same time, one Gallup poll estimated that &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/658148/inability-pay-care-medicine-hits-new-high.aspx"&gt;11% of the population cannot afford or access health care&lt;/a&gt; as more people turn to online supplements in an attempt to treat their health problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take people with conditions that notoriously lack treatments like Crohn’s disease or other inflammatory bowel disorders, which share some common symptoms with intestinal parasite infections. Of the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/crohns-disease/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;1 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. with Crohn’s, &lt;a href="https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/patientsandcaregivers/What-is-crohns-disease/treatment#:~:text=Surgery,frequently%20recurs%20later%20in%20life."&gt;two-thirds will end up needing surgery&lt;/a&gt; because available medications are not enough to keep the progression of the disease at bay. Many may be trying these cleanses in an attempt to feel relief, Moore explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ll try a parasite cleanse not because they are convinced they have a parasite, but because they are reaching for something out of desperation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, more people might be thinking they are infected with parasites as mistrust also grows surrounding the environmental systems designed to protect our food and ecosystems from dangerous waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals have gone so far as to stop using &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/dining/raw-water-unfiltered.html"&gt;the water grid&lt;/a&gt; altogether, instead &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/raw-water-natural-springs.html"&gt;collecting water from natural streams&lt;/a&gt;. However, that might ironically &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the risk of drinking water that is contaminated with parasites, if those streams are downriver from waste exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a bit of truth in the sense that the U.S. has been somehow lax in terms of how much processing you allow for food and how much additional ingredients you have,” Chaccour said. “But that is not the same as going out to nature to collect your own water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the symptoms Kurt was experiencing after the cleanse faded away. In 2016, he started going to the gym, and his energy levels returned. His gut stopped bothering him, and he had what he describes as some of the best years of his life. Despite the reaction he had to the cleanse, he does feel that it helped him get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It's hard to say if it was the cleanse that helped me or was it ultimately going to the gym and being a lot more active, or a combination of both.” Kurt said. “Looking back, I could probably say that it was a positive decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Kurt has recently entered into another challenging part of his life. He is experiencing a range of new symptoms he thinks stem from an exposure to toxic mold. He has considered doing a parasite cleanse again, even though he doesn't think he has a parasite. On one hand, he feels it helped him 10 years ago and could have a similar effect again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But I feel like, if that's not the case, I'm not really in a position to be able to deal with negative effects that might come from it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is burnt out from visiting doctors. In his search for more information on what could be causing his malaise, he finds it difficult to sort through what information online is real and what is bogus, he said. But the anecdotal experiences can only go so far, and what works for one person may not work for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's a lot of misinformation, but I do think there is a lot of good information out there, and it's just that it comes to a point when it's very difficult to separate which is which,” he said. “It’s certainly a gamble and I think it has its place. You just have to tread with caution.”&lt;/p&gt;

Chronic inflammation is at the root of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-of-inflammation-7565179" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;many health symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including fatigue, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-joint-health-6752953" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;joint pain&lt;/a&gt;, and stomach upset—just to name a few examples. Fortunately, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/anti-inflammatory-diet" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;foods that fight inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, from fruits to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-tea-to-drink-daily-8608683" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;. But what about herbs, a key component of delicious and colorful dishes? As it turns out, herbs can boost the anti-inflammatory potential of a meal, and there’s one that’s particularly helpful. Ahead, a registered dietitian calls out the best herb for inflammation, including how it works in the body, and ways to eat it at home.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to boost the anti-inflammatory potential of your meals, reach for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/rosemary-oil-for-hair-growth-7112537" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rosemary&lt;/a&gt;. The lemony pine-like herb contains phytochemicals (more specifically, phenolic compounds) that provide anti-inflammatory and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; properties, according to Madeline Schneider, RDN, LDN, registered dietitian and founder of The Nurtured Nutritionist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re unfamiliar with phytochemicals, they’re “naturally-occurring bioactive chemicals found in plants that provide health benefits to the body,” explains Schneider. In rosemary, the main anti-inflammatory phytochemical is carnosic acid, which “works by activating enzymes that make up the body’s natural defense system against inflammation,” says Schneider. It also targets inflammatory cytokines (a type of protein), which cause inflammation in the body, notes Schneider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But carnosic acid doesn’t work alone. Rosemary also contains rosmarinic acid—a phenolic compound that boasts “anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the body,” per Schneider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting that rosemary, like other herbs, is eaten in small amounts in dishes—so simply adding it to your meals won’t completely conquer all inflammation. As Schneider notes, it would take unrealistically large amounts of rosemary to significantly help with inflammation. “That’s why eating a well-balanced diet with a variety of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/most-nutrient-dense-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt; can help you better meet nutrient needs [and] provide health benefits, such as lowering inflammation, over time in a cumulative effect,” notes Schneider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, it’s more practical to focus on a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods—and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; find opportunities to incorporate rosemary for additional flavor and benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beyond fighting inflammation, rosemary also provides many other health benefits,” shares Schneider. This includes “antimicrobial properties to help fight infection, antioxidants to help fight cellular damage, antitumorigenic properties to slow the growth of cancer cells, and neuroprotective benefits,” explains Schneider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Rosemary can be added to dishes as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/fresh-herbs-vs-dried-herbs-8762392" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fresh or dried herb&lt;/a&gt;,” says Schneider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Enjoy the aroma and health benefits of rosemary by making herbal tea,” suggests Schneider. Here’s how: Steep a fresh rosemary sprig in boiling water, let steep for 10 to 15 minutes, add flavoring ingredients such as lemon juice or honey, remove the sprig, and enjoy, per Schneider. (Bonus:&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/raw-honey-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Honey&lt;/a&gt; offers impressive anti-inflammatory benefits, too.)

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chop rosemary leaves to add to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/quick-easy/marinade-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meat marinade&lt;/a&gt; or rub,” recommends Schneider. It works especially well with&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/rosemary-garlic-chicken-thighs" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; chicken thighs&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/rosemary-lamb-chops-recipe-8423425" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; lamb chops&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a side of hearty roasted vegetables.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For an easy way to add rosemary to dishes, infuse the herb into cooking oil, per Schneider. Simply place a few sprigs of fresh rosemary into &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/olive-oil-health-benefits-8754789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, then let sit for about two weeks. To speed up the process, gently warm olive oil and rosemary in a pot for about 10 minutes, then let it steep for one hour. According to Schneider, you can use rosemary-infused olive oil just as you would regular olive oil: as a dip for crusty bread, a drizzle for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/roasted-vegetables-recipe-ideas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;roasted vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, or a cooking oil for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/ways-to-use-up-extra-eggs-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you prefer savory treats, try your hand at a&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/garlic-and-rosemary-focaccia-8576007" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Garlic and Rosemary Focaccia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/herb-and-cheese-crackers-recipe-6829817" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Herb and Cheese Crackers&lt;/a&gt;.
