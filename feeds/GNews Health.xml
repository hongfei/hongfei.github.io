But getting it right depends on the book, and the person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the summer of 2017, Elizabeth Russell was going through a rough patch. It was during a difficult divorce, involving her two young teenagers, while she was still in the throes of a long-term depression. "It was just a really, really stressful time," recalls Russell, a teacher and librarian at an elementary school in Connecticut, US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But then on the internet she came across something called "creative bibliotherapy", where a tailored recommendation of fiction is offered with the aim of improving mental health. The name Ella Berthoud, a bibliotherapist based in Sussex, UK, who co-wrote the book &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707738-the-novel-cure" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;The Novel Cure&lt;/a&gt; about such literary remedies, kept popping up. Russell – an avid reader – immediately wanted to try it out.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After quizzing Russell on her reading habits and interviewing her about her challenges, Berthoud sent her a list of book recommendations relevant to her life, many featuring characters navigating tough marital decisions, like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33107351-george-and-lizzie" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;George and Lizzie&lt;/a&gt; by Nancy Pearl. "I just was blown away," Russell recalls. Learning from the lessons and mistakes of fictional characters helped her process what she was going through and made her feel less alone. "It opened up something in me that needed to be opened and needed to heal," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the UK and elsewhere, bibliotherapy – which also includes recommendations for non-fiction and self-help literature – has been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/blog/reading-well-supporting-health-and-wellbeing-through-reading#:~:text=The%20public%20have%20also%20been,3.8%20million%20Reading%20Well%20books." class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;soaring in popularity&lt;/a&gt; as a means of improving people's wellbeing, help navigate tough life decisions, and even to treat specific mental health conditions.

Considering the shortage of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bma.org.uk/what-we-do/population-health/supporting-peoples-mental-health/failing-mental-healthcare-system" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;affordable mental health services&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2023/751416/EPRS_BRI(2023)751416_EN.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;many countries&lt;/a&gt;, the idea that fiction can offer support is appealing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As anyone who has ever read and loved a work of drama, poetry or fiction can attest, stories have powerful effects on our minds and emotions. But that doesn't mean that any kind of fiction boosts mental health for everyone. Several experts interviewed for this article worry about what they see as an overhyped promise of creative bibliotherapy in treating specific mental health conditions, where they say the scientific evidence is still rather thin. In fact, research suggests that certain books &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-018-0191-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;can even be harmful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rather, the existing research paints a more nuanced picture, suggesting that fiction &lt;i id="can" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; help boost general wellbeing, but it depends a lot on the person, the book and how they engage with it, says James Carney, a computational cognitive scientist at the London Interdisciplinary School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's this idea that books are this cultic object that are going to make everything better," Carney says. "I think for a certain number of conditions and for a certain type of personality, it can be the case, but the idea that they're a universal medicine is just simply false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images/ BBC Some people report great advantages from reading fiction to help with major life events (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Some people report great advantages from reading fiction to help with major life events (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some trace the origins of bibliotherapy to World War One, when fiction and non-fiction books were used to ease soldiers' suffering and trauma. But the idea made a return in the 1990s, Carney says. Today it takes many forms – from bibliotherapists like Berthoud who offer tailored recommendations for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ellaberthoud.com/christmas-bibliotherapy" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;£100 ($130) per session&lt;/a&gt;, to some GPs who point some of their patients to fiction, like Andrew Schuman. He's an NHS physician who advises the bibliotherapy charity &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.relitfoundation.org/about" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ReLit&lt;/a&gt; and co-wrote the 2016 Lancet paper about the benefits of bibliotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While fiction bibliotherapy isn't a substitute for other treatments, "in conjunction with other therapies, it can be a massively powerful, boosting therapy", Schuman says. A benefit compared with other therapy types, Russell adds, is that people can do it on their own time, approaching their books when they feel emotionally ready and putting them down if they're overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since 2013, the UK non-profit The Reading Agency's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://readingagency.org.uk/get-reading/our-programmes-and-campaigns/reading-well/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Reading Well&lt;/a&gt; programme has been curating book lists for people with conditions like dementia or depression. These lists are hand-picked and reviewed by experts and people with lived experiences of those conditions, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://readingagency.org.uk/about-us/our-people/staff/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;says Gemma Jolly&lt;/a&gt;, the organisation's head of health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Jolly says the goal is to guide people to genuinely helpful titles, especially given the overwhelming number of books about mental health and what she perceives as widespread snobbery around what qualifies as "good" literature. By partnering with local libraries in England and Wales, the programme has facilitated loans of over 3.9 million books since its inception, she says. Even some UK health agencies have taken note of bibliotherapy: in certain cases, such as eating disorders, self-help books are recognised as a therapeutic tool in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK49304/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;clinical guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. It's worth noting that, like fiction recommendations, not all self-help books tailored to a condition or life stage are going to be beneficial and effective for all patients – and you should consult your GP if you have specific health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet the evidence that reading helps mental health is complicated. Scientists have observed that, compared with non-readers, people who read regularly for pleasure tend to be less stressed, depressed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40034518" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;and lonely&lt;/a&gt;, more socially connected and confident, and&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105607/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; perhaps even live longer&lt;/a&gt;, as the psychological scientist Giulia Poerio of the University of Sussex in the UK &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.redalyc.org/journal/1798/179862340004/html/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;summarised&lt;/a&gt; in a 2020 article. But, Poerio asks, "is it actually that reading fiction is improving wellbeing, or is it just the case that people with better wellbeing tend to be people who read fiction?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For many self-help books – which some experts &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5902994/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;describe&lt;/a&gt; as essentially self-guided therapy – the benefits are clear, Poerio says. One &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15554567/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2004 study&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, found that self-help books can help people with anxiety and depression, while a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004191.pub2/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt; on patients with eating disorders found that self-help was similarly effective as other psychological therapies in reducing binging, purging and symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the evidence is shaky when it comes to treating specific mental health conditions. Some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0300443840160304" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts have theorised&lt;/a&gt; that reading about characters with our own lived experiences &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2161-1939.2010.tb00087.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;allows us to identify with them&lt;/a&gt; and experience a cathartic moment when the characters overcome challenges, which we can then emulate in our own lives, explains Emily Troscianko, a literary scientist at the University of Oxford. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is little research on whether this actually happens, she says. In her view, "I think [it's] so simplistic and clearly not what's happening a lot of the time when people are reading about difficult experiences that have some similarity to their own," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images/ BBC For some health conditions, reading fiction tailored to that condition can cause harm rather than help (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;For some health conditions, reading fiction tailored to that condition can cause harm rather than help (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Anecdotally, many people say they feel that fiction has helped with their mental states; 81% of people who took part in The Reading Agency's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://tra-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/entries/document/6637/RW_Infographic_MAIN_2020-2022.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2022 annual survey&lt;/a&gt; said their Reading Well book helped them better understand their health needs.

The existing research doesn't meet that standard, he says. In the case of post-traumatic stress disorder, for instance – a condition where some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08893675.2017.1266190" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; believe that fictional worlds could be especially useful in allowing patients to process emotions that may otherwise feel threatening – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08893675.2017.1266190" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that there weren't any high-quality studies to prove beneficial effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Literature is complicated.

They were asked how reading fiction books had affected their mood, self-esteem, diets and exercise habits and how they felt about their bodies. Surprisingly to Troscianko, when people recalled reading books featuring characters with eating disorders, it tended to worsen their symptoms. "If you've got an eating disorder, you're likely to at least perceive that the effects of reading that stuff for yourself were negative," she says. Worryingly, about a dozen participants said they even actively sought out such books, she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Troscianko speculates that these books trigger the same ill feelings that drive eating disorders, such as competitiveness around each other's bodies and eating habits. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39135111/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; she's done suggests that people with eating disorders struggle to focus on texts that are not relevant to their condition. Ultimately, "the only stuff that you can focus on is actually just drawing you further into that obsessive world of narrow obsessions," she says. "This is one reason why I get frustrated with the quite blithe attitude of, 'reading books about stuff must always be helpful' because, well, it just depends on the books. Literature is complicated. Human beings are complicated, and so why wouldn't you expect the effects also to be complex and nuanced?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Carney suspects that people with addiction may be similarly triggered by novels featuring characters with substance abuse habits, which often tend to glamorise addiction, Carney says. Meanwhile, Schuman, the NHS doctor, stresses that he only discusses fiction with patients he knows well, and that he'd never recommend it for people in the grip of a psychotic illness or who are having suicidal thoughts – which he says could be harmful but also inappropriate and unhelpful, possibly undermining patients' trust in doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Reading Well programme is mindful of these kinds of nuances, Jolly says. For example, in light of the research that fictionalised accounts of certain conditions could be detrimental, The Reading Agency developed a list of generally &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/mood-boosting-books" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;mood-boosting, uplifting books&lt;/a&gt; for people who want to escape from any condition or experience they’re going through. The Reading Well recommendations for adults with eating disorders only include books that offer practical support and not fictionalised accounts relating to eating habits and body image (although the reading lists for teens do include such books, based on feedback from health professionals and young people who wanted more personal stories, Jolly says). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Reading Well programme has also removed fictionalised stories about dementia after feedback from patients who said they prefer real-world accounts that better capture the nuances of the condition. Jolly acknowledges that books aren't the solution for everyone. "We always say it's not a one size fits all," she says. "It's about having an additional tool that might work for some people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm94z.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images/ BBC Discussing a book with other like-minded people can bring even more benefits than simply reading alone (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Discussing a book with other like-minded people can bring even more benefits than simply reading alone (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;None of this is to say that fiction can't help improve certain conditions. One small &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thereader.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Therapeutic_benefits_of_reading_final_report_March_2011.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; tracking two groups of up to eight people with depression reported &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thereader.org.uk/investigation-therapeutic-benefits-reading-relation-depression-well/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;better mental health&lt;/a&gt; over a year in which they attended group readings of poetry and fiction. Carney suspects that certain kinds of fiction could be helpful for people with anxiety which, at its core, is driven by unpredictability. He suggests that reading fiction featuring predictable character types – like a lot of 19th-Century, Sherlock-Holmes-type stories – could be helpful, "because you're essentially flooding the world with evidence that the world is predictable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Outside the context of treating specific conditions, reading fiction, drama or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ebbbb948bf7835fcbe67b02/t/5ebec4d0fffacc230dcfde9d/1589560532297/MindfulPoetryTrial.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; could help boost general mental wellbeing. For instance, people with chronic pain who &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17533015.2014.957330" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;took part&lt;/a&gt; in a reading-aloud programme hosted by the UK charity The Reader Organisation reported they felt a sense of shared community, improvements in mood and quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Such wellbeing boosts may depend on how people engage with books. In &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.redalyc.org/journal/1798/179862340004/html/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one of Poerio's studies&lt;/a&gt;, she and her colleagues had 94 senior-aged people listen to audiobooks that they had selected from a list of popular fiction and non-fiction books. Remarkably, even two weeks after the programme, participants reported an improvement in their wellbeing and felt their lives to be more meaningful – but only those people who said they had engaged deeply with, and appreciated, their book. "When people were emotionally engaged with the content of the book – it was transporting them, they were feeling absorbed, it resonated with them, it had a lasting impression on them – that's where we saw benefits to wellbeing," Poerio says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Carney agrees that merely giving people a novel won't have much effect; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8993009/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;his research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that reflecting on books afterwards – especially together with other people – provides a much bigger wellbeing boost. Discussing literature gives people a way to think about distressing things that doesn't impinge on their wellbeing, Carney says. "When you're reading fiction, you're not bothered by Heathcliff or what Heathcliff's going to do, because Heathcliff is insulated from you by the fact that he's not real. Fiction gives you a way to rehearse all these difficult, challenging social scenarios," Carney says. And "if you can do that with other people, it makes it more real, it makes it more impactful". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For people wanting to try out bibliotherapy for themselves, Carney recommends trying to find a club for group discussions. Jolly recommends public libraries, where you can try lots of books for free – and if a book isn't resonating with you, pick up another one instead, try something shorter, or a different genre like poetry. And if reading isn't for you, Poerio adds, maybe there are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32567876/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;other ways to improve wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, like music or visual art. "If you feel it's helping you, if you're feeling the benefit… you'll want to carry on," Schuman says. "But if it feels unhelpful or intrusive, then [you] should feel completely at liberty to stop at any point." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As for Russell, she's convinced that bibliotherapy offers a path to better mental health and has done a session with Berthoud several times since her first appointment. She's even bought her friends bibliotherapy vouchers, and is using it to help her students, too, selecting books that discuss immigrant experiences, themes of loss, or other hardships. "I think the biggest point of it is so you don't feel so alone," she says. "You can take a deep breath and say, I'm not on this journey by myself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* All content within this column is provided for general information only and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

			&lt;p&gt;Your brain makes insulin – the same insulin produced by your pancreas. The same insulin that is not produced in people with type 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="164871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and the same insulin that does not work properly in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known for over 100 years about insulin producing cells in the pancreas. These spherical islands of cells, called islets, contain insulin producing beta cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we've only just started to learn about brain insulin production. The fact that insulin is made there is still largely unknown, even among diabetes scientists, doctors and people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, it was discovered there in the late 1970s – then promptly disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.75.11.5737"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in 1978 showed the levels of insulin in the rat brain were "at least 10 times higher than that found in plasma … and in some regions … 100 times higher".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If true, why isn't this more widely known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164881" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_brain_642.jpg" alt="the brain" class="wp-image-164881 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_brain_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_brain_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_brain_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164881" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;We've known for nearly 50 years that the brain can produce insulin as well. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFgRN8mnc/"&gt;cosmin4000/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because soon after this discovery, clear evidence showed the transfer of insulin from blood to brain. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780120273102500189"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 1983 measuring insulin in rodent brain said that "insulin found in these extracts was ultimately derived from pancreatic insulin". They could not find the machinery to process insulin in the brain, at least with the tools available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the assumption – for nearly the next 30 years – that all brain insulin came from the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin can and does move from the blood to the brain. But local sources of insulin are produced in specific places to do specific things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The brain cells that make insulin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, what is surprising about brain insulin production is that there is not one but at least six types of insulin-producing brain cell. Some have been confirmed in both rodent and human brain, others currently just in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first brain cells shown to make insulin is the neurogliaform cell. These live in a brain area important for learning and memory. Most surprisingly, the production of insulin here depends on the amount of glucose present – a feature shared with pancreatic beta cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its not clear what this insulin source does. Based on the location, it may contribute to cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area also has cells that create new neurons throughout life, called "neural progenitors". These cells also make insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar cell from the olfactory bulb, the processing centre for smell, also has insulin-producing progenitors. What insulin does here is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one insulin producing brain cell might regulate growth. A 2020 &lt;a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/135412"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that insulin is made and released from stress-sensing neurons in the mouse hypothalamus. This is a brain area that controls growth and metabolism. It also has the highest insulin levels in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6363522/"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that stressing mice caused hypothalamic insulin production to decrease. This led to poorer growth in the animals. In the case of mice, their bodies were shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothalamic insulin maintained growth hormone levels in the pituitary gland. This is sometimes called the master gland as its involved in making or controlling production of other hormones. Having less local insulin meant less growth hormone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the choroid plexus. This is the brain region that makes cerebrospinal fluid. In humans, that is about half a litre of this clear colourless liquid every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells lining the choroid plexus – the epithelial cells – make a nourishing broth of growth factors and nutrients to keep the brain healthy. Only recently was insulin production found here in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choroid plexus secretes fluid directly into brain ventricles, the spaces deep inside the brain. This fluid flows around the whole brain, perhaps delivering insulin more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164880" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_642.jpg" alt="man rejecting food" class="wp-image-164880 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/insulin_2location_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164880" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain insulin suppresses appetite. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAE77-YawTs/"&gt;klebercordeiro/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One place it does travel to is the appetite control centre in the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)00914-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124723009142%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in mice showed that genetic control of insulin production by the choroid plexus could change food intake. The hypothalamus was rewired by changing choroid plexus insulin levels. Insulin released from here suppressed appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source of insulin in the brain also reduces food intake. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36244663/"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; found that insulin producing neurons at the back of the brain, called the hindbrain, reduced food intake in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Might help the brain stay healthy as we age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if brain insulin can change appetite, does it control blood sugar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. At least there is no evidence for this currently. It is unlikely this insulin leaves the brain. Therefore, its unlikely to control glucose levels in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, insulin in the brain might help the brain stay healthy as we age. For example,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is often, unofficially, termed type 3 diabetes. This is because the brain is insulin resistant in Alzheimer's. It cannot properly use glucose either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big problem. Glucose is the main fuel for the brain. In fact, estimates suggest there is a 20% energy gap in Alzheimer's. Even without brain cell loss, this alone will impair cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led to attempts to boost brain insulin. Spraying insulin into the nose can improve &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/1107947"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's, in some, but not all studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain glucose use also decreases over time and intranasal insulin also seems to limit this decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, is more brain insulin always a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. In &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5734123/"&gt;women specifically&lt;/a&gt;, higher levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with poorer cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still much to learn about brain insulin production. For example, which insulin source came first? The brain or the beta cell? Hopefully it doesn't take another 30 years to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the strength of evidence of brain insulin production, it won't be long until our school textbooks are updated.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256264/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I make sure I am up-to-date on vaccines before travel,” Wu said. “Flu and COVID-19 are so common among travelers, and even a mild case can ruin a trip. Also, for international travel, there are additional vaccines that might be recommended or required, or even malaria prophylaxis for some areas. I suggest travelers check the CDC [Centers for Disease Control Prevention] travel website or see a travel medicine specialist for advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to getting the necessary travel vaccines ahead of time, you may want to procure special medications in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider getting a prescription for diarrhea medicine if traveling to another country where traveler’s diarrhea may be an issue,” Bawer advised. “If traveling to another country, avoid drinking their water — this includes anything washed with local water like salad and fruit. Focus on eating foods that have a shell and don’t need washing and drink bottled water. Also, use this to brush your teeth. This can help to avoid traveler’s diarrhea from developing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packing an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal like Imodium is another good idea, especially when traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I’m uncertain about particular meals, I try to stick to foods that have been fully cooked and are served hot, avoiding raw and undercooked foods,” Viola added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.

from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152586102500204X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:international study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;international study&lt;/a&gt;, led by researchers at the University of Waterloo’s School of Public Health Sciences and published in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, has found that loneliness, while common among older adults receiving home care, is not associated with an increased risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that loneliness may not independently increase the risk of death after controlling for other health risk factors among older adults in home care,” said lead author Bonaventure Egbujie, a professor in Waterloo’s School of Public Health Sciences, in a &lt;a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/study-loneliness-doesnt-raise-mortality-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. “This contradicts much of the existing literature based on the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest study, researchers analyzed data from more than 380,000 home care recipients aged 65 and older in Canada, Finland, and New Zealand. “Home care recipients are a particularly important population to consider because they may be especially vulnerable to adverse effects of loneliness,” the study authors write. “Mobility problems, sensory impairments, and complex health needs may limit their engagement in the community, leaving them relatively isolated in their homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what researchers found was that lonely individuals actually had a lower risk of dying within one year compared to their non-lonely counterparts (after adjusting for health conditions, age, and other risk factors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, said senior study author John Hirdes, a professor in Waterloo’s School of Public Health Sciences, that doesn’t mean it isn’t still a serious health concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is a serious threat to psychological well-being,” Hirdes said in the news release. “The mental health consequences of loneliness make it an important priority for public health, even if loneliness doesn’t kill you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, loneliness prevalence—meaning the number of people per 100 who reported feeling lonely—ranged from 15.9% of home care recipients in Canada to 24.4% in New Zealand. “Interestingly,” notes the news release, “people in better physical shape and who got less help from family or friends were likelier to feel lonely, suggesting a complex link between health status, caregiving needs, and social connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors call for more longer-term studies and for policymakers and health-care providers to treat loneliness as a quality-of-life issue, not only focusing on its potential link to mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Home and community care services,” said Hirdes, “must play a protective role by supporting social contact for isolated people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More on loneliness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/06/16/loneliness-not-as-deadly-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:09:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBjMG1QUDBBOExHc3V0eGVHRGR6U0Z4UTdfN0NjUjFjQVRfX0pidGpoRFNVa2U3OEdvbHBnSUl2Wm1lbi1KYi1STHZlVlROSjdkUjV1WjFpTHI2NmhTNUQxb0xjd3JvbUV5akNhaHpWVG1XOXF2MFp1elFOX3Y</guid></item><item><title>为了预防卵巢癌，输卵管切除术正在增加- statnews.com | To prevent ovarian cancers, fallopian tube removal is on the rise - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPcmRpWmJWSkdCSWYwRUZuVVRtRHMybmhLVVYzVFpkc3BBck9IWHpRODc1d2VDWGU1LXEzeUdGMERPRmxKV0dnS2QwUGlOcmN2UlJBQXpVc2JsLW5RVzF2UndMMlV3Wk4zOFNKVEdvMkNKcUtSTjgtdHpJWmlCTXJkdnl0NnFOeXBLWDhKeDlIOVRMQldienZFVTQzelptcElZZHlHUkUwZllSSjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Rebecca Stone, the single most important fact about ovarian cancer is that it’s usually a misnomer. The most common kind — responsible for 70% of cases and 90% of deaths — often has its silent beginnings not in the ovary, but in the fallopian tube. This isn’t just an interesting factoid; as a gynecologic oncologist at Johns Hopkins, Stone sees it as a reason to evangelize. There’s no way to screen for so-called ovarian cancer, no colonoscopy, mammogram, or Pap smear equivalent. It’s typically found late, once it’s already spread. The treatments are middling at best. Among the best tools is surgical prevention: If someone doesn’t want more kids, and is considering another abdominal surgery, a surgeon can offer to take the tubes out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opportunistic salpingectomy, it’s called. “Somebody says, ‘Can I get my tubes tied?’ And I will say, ‘Well, actually, we don’t tie tubes anymore, we remove them,’” said Greg Marchand, an OB-GYN in Mesa, Ariz. There are exceptions, but generally, since the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2019/04/opportunistic-salpingectomy-as-a-strategy-for-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; offering it in 2015, he’s gone with salpingectomy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet if Stone feels the need to proselytize about it, it’s because she often meets doctors who don’t know about it. She remembers her surprise when she clicked into a virtual meeting in 2023 with medical bureaucrats whose jobs involve tracking diagnoses and interventions. “There were hundreds of people on this call, lots of them medical coders — people who are familiar with the development of new coding for new discoveries — and they had never heard of this. No one,” Stone said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Confusion abounded. Salpingectomies were documented as tubal ligations; patients didn’t know whether their tubes had been blocked off or completely removed. Beneath those ambiguities was a wonkier one. In the lexicon doctors use to chronicle and bill for their work, there were no medical codes specific to opportunistic salpingectomy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, after two years of advocating, Stone has convinced the committee behind &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd-10-maintenance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the American diagnostic bible&lt;/a&gt; to create those codes. When they come into use in October, she hopes it will help clarify what patients are signing up for. That’s part of her mission: To give true consent, people need to understand the difference between these procedures — and the cancer risk that had set this whole change in motion to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It started in the 1990s, with a different kind&lt;/strong&gt; of risk-reducing surgery. Geneticists had &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/brca-breast-cancer-men-prostate-pancreas/680698/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;discovered &lt;/a&gt;that mutations in BRCA genes drastically increased the rates of certain tumors, mothers and aunts and sisters all born without a molecular tool for repairing damaged DNA, all dying of breast and ovarian cancer. For their surviving relatives, surgeons began offering to remove those tissues. It was invasive and awful, and in the case of ovaries, caused sudden menopause, which carried a host of complications. But it might just save their lives.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Pathologists, meanwhile, began examining the tissues that had been excised. If they could figure out where the tumors began, they might see how better to detect and treat them. The trouble was, they never found consistent precursors in the ovary. The cancers clung to its surface, but the seeds seemed to be coming from elsewhere. There was some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15467531/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hypothesizing&lt;/a&gt; that they emerged in the fallopian tube, but it seemed far-fetched. The tube was just a backdrop for the drama of fertilization, a mere conduit connecting uterus and ovary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I came to a meeting probably around 2003, and I got up and said I didn’t think it happened,” said Christopher Crum, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He’d examined plenty of tubes in his time, and seen little to suggest that’s where cancers arose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then he started having second thoughts. Like others, he’d been examining a smidgen of the tube, cut from the middle. What if that were the wrong place? Each tube was 4 or 5 inches long, and wasn’t uniform. It was a widening flume with tentacle-like fringes at the end: a Dr. Seussian cross between a medieval trumpet and a sea anemone. Crum wondered what he would find if he sectioned and inspected the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t expecting to get knocked over,” he said — but within six weeks, he’d &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16434898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; five early cancers, mostly in the fringes he normally would have thrown away. In the previous decade, he hadn’t found any. Pathologists hadn’t seen anything in the tubes because they hadn’t truly been looking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t unique to people with BRCA mutations. The tubes of women with average cancer risk, it turned out, sometimes had potential precursors: cells that looked largely healthy but had telltale signs of DNA damage. Most wouldn’t go on to become cancers, but carried that sliver of a threat. When researchers in Vancouver examined the tubes of 12 consecutive ovarian cancer patients, they saw that threat borne out: Every single one had either those DNA-damaged cells, oncologist Dianne Miller recalled, “or the fallopian tube had been totally blown apart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why so many cancers begin in the tube still isn’t entirely clear, but one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10588628/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; has to do with ovulation. The less often someone ovulates — because of pregnancy, say, or birth control pills — the lower their risk of ovarian cancer. It makes a certain kind of sense, given the DNA damage involved: “In order for that egg to kind of ooze or burst out of the ovary, it has to essentially erode some of the layers of the ovary itself,” explained Ronny Drapkin, a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The tasseled end of the fallopian tube hovers right there, draped over the ovary, ready to catch the egg and swish it toward potential fertilization, and, eventually, the uterus. It gets a repeated dose of the tissue-eroding chemical cocktail that allows for ovulation, and its cells &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37729060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;may be&lt;/a&gt; less well equipped to deal with molecular injury than others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, there was a growing consensus that most so-called ovarian cancers had a similar backstory. It started with quiet DNA damage going unrepaired in one fallopian tube, pushing cells into proliferating wildly, breaking free of the membrane they usually clung to for survival. Some migrated out to colonize the ovarian surface, and from there, spread further into the pelvic cavity. People with BRCA mutations were more susceptible, with the double whammy of normal wear and tear plus a faulty internal fix-it crew. But it happened in others, too. By the time the symptoms were noticeable, it was often too late. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By 2010, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24412119/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the idea of removing tubes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was cemented in Miller’s mind. She was a gynecologic oncologist at the University of British Columbia, and knew that vast numbers of women got pelvic surgeries. For some, it was a hysterectomy to treat fibroids or heavy menstrual bleeding: removing the uterus, which connects to the tubes’ narrow ends. For others, it was a tubal ligation — colloquially, “tube-tying” — a sterilization procedure that involved severing, blocking, or clamping a tiny bit of the tube. To Miller, those surgeries were opportunities: a chance to remove cancer precursors before they arose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When her team looked at the medical records of British Columbians who’d had ovarian cancer, some 40% of them had previously had one of those operations. That represented thousands of potentially preventable cancers. “That was part of the impetus,” said Gillian Hanley, an epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia. “This was worth trying, because people were so tired of watching women die from ovarian cancer. They were willing to try anything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So began a province-wide campaign, with Miller asking surgeons to suggest salpingectomy to anyone considering either hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Ovarian cancer is rare enough — and often occurs late enough in life — that it would take years to see any statistically meaningful decrease in cases. In the meantime, opportunistic salpingectomy started taking root. The Canadian society representing gynecologic oncologists recommended offering it in 2011. The American equivalent did the same in 2013. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists got on board two years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Already, there were hopeful data. In &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/107/2/dju410/901489?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, researchers dug through decades of records of tubes excised for other reasons: an abscess, an ectopic pregnancy. Those who’d had both tubes removed had half the ovarian cancer risk of those who’d had only one tube out, as if the surgery were a preventive drug, more effective in its full dose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miller and Hanley’s &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788855" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, when they came in 2022, suggested the same thing. If the nearly 26,000 British Columbians who’d opted for opportunistic salpingectomy had gotten the most common and deadliest form of ovarian cancer at the same rate as the control group — who’d kept their tubes — there should have been at least five cases. Instead, there were zero. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just an artifact of salpingectomy-choosers smoking less, exercising more, and being less cancer-prone overall. Their rates of breast and colorectal tumors were the same as the control group’s. Rather, though it sounded drastic to some, opportunistic salpingectomy seemed like a potential boon for public health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the uptake statistics, and you might be surprised&lt;/strong&gt; at Stone’s quest to publicize salpingectomy. There’s already been a massive increase. From 2010 to 2017, among Americans with private insurance, salpingectomy rates &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8756422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;jumped&lt;/a&gt; 18-fold during sterilizations and 8-fold during non-cancer-related hysterectomies. When STAT asked medical records giant Epic’s research arm for more recent data on tubal removals replacing tube-tying, the company &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/articles/preference-for-salpingectomies-over-tubal-ligations-among-female-sterilization-procedures-is-increasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that there were 115 salpingectomies for every 100 tubal ligations in 2015, and 332 salpingectomies for every 100 tubal ligations in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But Stone was worried about what lurked behind those crisp-seeming numbers. Epic Research reported running into the same issues. In some cases, it was impossible to know whether a patient had gotten a tubal ligation or a salpingectomy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partially, it was a question of translation. To get reimbursed, American doctors report what happened in a clinical encounter using two different codes, one describing the diagnosis, the why of the visit, and another describing the services rendered, what they did about it. But certain “what” codes didn’t distinguish between ligating a small bit of the tube and removing the organ entirely, and there were no “why” codes that captured some patients’ cancer-prevention rationale when going in for another surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This being the United States, the problem is exacerbated by insurance hurdles. Some state Medicaid programs explicitly won’t pay for salpingectomy for sterilization purposes; some private insurers deny those claims, too. The National Women’s Law Center estimates that its contraception coverage &lt;a href="https://nwlc.org/tips-from-the-coverher-hotline-navigating-coverage-for-female-sterilization-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hotline&lt;/a&gt; gets about 20 to 25 intakes a week, and three quarters of them are about issues with salpingectomy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The very thing that makes it alluring to doctors and patients alike — permanent contraception and cancer prevention in one fell swoop — doesn’t compute in insurer-speak. “The insurer will be like, ‘We can’t cover it, because this is not a &lt;a href="https://nwlc.org/i-was-told-the-billing-code-for-my-bilateral-salpingectomy-is-not-a-preventive-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;preventive code&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll cover it if your doctor changes it to a preventive code.’ And so they go to their doctor, and their doctor is like, ‘I can’t change it, I coded it correctly,’” explained Lauren Wallace, a lawyer at the center. “It’s an absolute mess.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence of deliberate fudging, patients counseling each other on Reddit to ask their doctors to perform salpingectomies but code them as tubal ligations, to get around insurance denials. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, some patients don’t know exactly what surgery they’ve gotten until after the fact. Tonya Gegenheimer, a bail bond agent and mother of three in Monrovia, La., only discovered she no longer had any tubes when she contacted a surgeon about getting her tubal ligation reversed, an operation that involves suturing the severed ends of the tube back together. “I was asked to get my operative and pathology report, and when I brought that to my appointment, he said, ‘Unfortunately, you’re not a candidate for reversal. They removed everything,’” Gegenheimer said. “That was not what I wanted. That was not the terminology that I agreed upon. I was very distraught.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is part of an online community of patients who’ve experienced a constellation of debilitating symptoms — abdominal pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, mood swings, brain fog — after a tubal ligation or salpingectomy, and can’t shake the feeling that this mysterious syndrome was caused by the sterilization. Though it doesn’t always work to restore fertility, which is the primary reason doctors offer it, to these patients, reversal is a way to potentially ease their symptoms. You can’t reverse a tubal removal, though, and some worry about the trend toward salpingectomy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They know that the syndrome they describe is controversial, and often dismissed by doctors: There’s robust safety data on both sterilization procedures, and the complication rates are low. But what this community wants, besides recognition and relief, is more in-depth consent, such that patients know in greater detail — and in advance — what each surgery involves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stone wants that, too. She’s often appalled at how poorly doctors explain procedures to patients, how often women know they’ve had a hysterectomy but aren’t sure whether they still have ovaries or tubes, how often they know they’ve had a “sterilization” but aren’t sure what exactly that means. So, in 2023, she proposed new “why” codes for opportunistic salpingectomy. She hoped it might boost insurance coverage, but also knowledge about the procedure beyond OB-GYNs. “The most real things in medicine are the things you can bill for,” she said. “It doesn’t matter how great the discovery is. If people can’t access this cancer prevention, you’re dead in the water.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, after two years of work, those codes will be published in the coming weeks, and come into use in October. Doctors will have the bureaucratic terminology to convey the distinction between these operations to insurers — and Stone is gearing up for more campaigning, so that that distinction gets transmitted not just in code but in plain English (and other languages), too. She wants patients to know that salpingectomy can significantly reduce the risk of certain ovarian cancers, but doesn’t eliminate it entirely. There are subtypes that begin elsewhere. There could be rare instances in which a tube is removed after a mutated cell has already floated out of the tasseled opening and seeded itself on the outside of the ovary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other places this procedure could go. &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; is underway to understand if it might protect BRCA-mutation carriers against so-called ovarian cancers, allowing some to avoid the sudden menopause that comes with ovary removal. For now, though, Stone mostly wants patients to know what’s in the most basic names their doctors bandy about. That “ovarian cancer” isn’t always as ovarian as it sounds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/spice-you-should-eat-if-you-have-ibs-11708729" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;herbs and spices have been shown to support digestive health&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s one spice that makes it to the top of the list. Read on to learn why dietitians recommend ginger to help you find relief and get things moving again—plus, how to incorporate it into your diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger is our No. 1 spice recommended to help you poop. Ginger is one of the best spices for constipation and motility, says &lt;a href="https://katrinacoxrd.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Katrina Cox, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Katrina Cox Nutrition, LLC. Ginger promotes movement of the digestive tract by encouraging contraction of the intestines to propel food through the GI system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It has also been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041356/foods-high-in-digestive-enzymes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;aid in digestion by increasing stomach acid&lt;/a&gt;, making digestive enzymes more efficient,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger contains the active compound gingerol, which is known for its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestive benefits, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;alleviating constipation&lt;/a&gt;, ginger helps to manage nausea and vomiting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adding ginger to your diet can be an easy, cost-effective way to promote digestive health and alleviate constipation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation is defined as having fewer than three bowel movements a week, with stools that are hard, dry and difficult to pass. Constipation is one of the most common digestive symptoms in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many things can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061979/reasons-constipated-not-food-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;back you up&lt;/a&gt;, including:

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of the time, constipation can be treated through nutrition and lifestyle changes. This includes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-spice-for-gut-health-8693267" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding spices to support digestion&lt;/a&gt; and healthy bowel function. “Spices can improve digestive health and ease constipation by stimulating digestive juices, relaxing the muscles in the digestive tract and encouraging the natural movement of the intestines,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a digestive health dietitian and owner of Nutrition Resolution. “Some spices also have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prebiotic properties&lt;/a&gt;, which help grow beneficial gut bacteria, further supporting digestion and regular bowel movements,” she explains.&lt;br&gt;

Women should aim for 9 (8-ounce) cups of fluid per day, and men should have at least 13 (8-ounce) cups.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Plan to get in 150 minutes of activity per week, or 30 minutes per day. Movement helps wake up a sluggish digestive system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

If you can, make time to head to the toilet in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a squat.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a toilet stool to prop up your feet, creating the ideal angle to help you go.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger has a peppery, strong and spicy aroma. It is used fresh or in powdered form. You can also eat it pickled or made into ginger chews. Fresh ginger can be sliced or grated and added to tea, stews, marinades or smoothies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger is safe for most people to consume in moderation. However, large doses can cause abdominal discomfort, heartburn, diarrhea or throat irritation—many of the symptoms you’re looking to prevent in the first place.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re opting for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ginger-affect-your-medication-11736943" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger supplements&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290281/health-benefits-of-ginger/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;effective amount of ginger for improving digestive health&lt;/a&gt; varies widely, says Simpson, “typically ranging from 0.5 to 2 grams per day and should be adjusted based on individual tolerance and specific health requirements.” (It’s always a good idea to check in with your doctor to get their recommendation.) For reference, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger is about 2 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger can be an easy spice to add to your diet to help you poop and alleviate constipation. It’s important to remember that adding ginger is just one strategy you can use to support your digestive health.

If you continue to struggle with constipation, it’s important to discuss this with your health care provider to investigate the root cause so you can find long-term relief.&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;While COVID-19 transmission remains low in the US, health experts are anxious about the potential for a big summer wave as two factors seem set for a collision course: a lull in infection activity that suggests protective responses have likely waned in the population, and a new SARS-CoV-2 variant with an infectious advantage over other variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant is dubbed NB.1.8.1. Like all the other currently circulating variants, it's a descendant of omicron. Specifically, NB.1.8.1 is derived from the recombinant variant XDV.1.5.1. Compared to the reigning omicron variants JN.1 and LP.8.1, the new variant has a few mutations that could help it bind to human cells more easily and evade some protective immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 23, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;designated NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; a "variant under monitoring," &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants"&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt; that early signals indicate it has an advantage over other variants, but its impact on populations is not yet clear. In recent weeks, parts of Asia, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, have experienced increases in infections and hospitalizations linked to NB.1.8.1's spread. Fortunately, the variant does not appear to cause more severe disease, and current vaccines are expected to remain effective against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it appears to be swiftly gaining ground in the US, fueling worries that it could cause a surge here as well. In the latest &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;tracking data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, NB.1.8.1 is estimated to account for 37 percent of cases in the US. That's up from 15 percent two weeks ago. NB.1.8.1 is now poised to overtake LP.8.1, which is estimated to make up 38 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that those estimates are based on limited data, so the CDC cautions that there are large possible ranges for the variants' actual proportions. For NB.1.81, the potential percentage of cases ranges from 13 percent to 68 percent, while LP.8.1's is 23 percent to 57 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

"After &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61442763/menopause-eating-disorders-side-effect/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61442763/menopause-eating-disorders-side-effect/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="menopause" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, the sharp decline in estrogen can disrupt this balance, leading to decreased tear secretion and increased tear evaporation." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But in addition to these hormonal shifts, there are other factors that can lead to your eyes feeling gritty and uncomfortable.

It happens when the tiny oil glands in your eyelids, called meibomian glands, don’t release enough oil into your tears, which causes them to evaporate too quickly. Just like oil floats on water, this oily layer sits on top of our tears to help keep them from drying out, says Arvind Saini, MD, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;MGD is often linked to inflammation in the eyelids, a condition more commonly known as blepharitis, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10032-blepharitis" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10032-blepharitis" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="9.1.0"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And, MGD can lead to dry eye disease (DED), also sometimes called dry eye syndrome, a chronic disease. So, if you suspect MGD is behind your dry eyes, make an appointment with your eye doctor who may recommend an in-office procedure, medication, or lifestyle tweaks like using a warm compress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-deficient-in-vitamin-d" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;2. You're deficient in vitamin D.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you live in a region that doesn't get much sunlight, especially during the winter, you may have a vitamin D deficiency. And being low in this important nutrient can contribute to dry eye, according to a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9860626/#sec6-ijms-24-01458" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9860626/#sec6-ijms-24-01458" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="International Journal of Molecular Sciences" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.1.0.0"&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  "Vitamin D itself can help decrease inflammation in the eye and improve tear quality to keep the eye moist," says David Bilstrom, MD, a doctor specializing in autoimmune functional medicine. Ask your primary care doctor for a blood test to check your vitamin D levels—always confer with your provider before starting any new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-wear-contacts" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;3. You wear contacts.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because contact lenses sit directly on the surface of the eye, they can mess with the natural lubrication process. "Contacts can disrupt the thin layer of lipids (fats) on the surface of the eye that helps prevent moisture from evaporating," Dr. Brissette says. "The lenses can also reduce oxygen flow to the cornea and mechanically interfere with blinking, which is essential for spreading tears evenly across the eye." Over time, this can lead to MGD. "Sometimes getting out of the contact lenses can help, and stopping their wear may be needed," Dr. Brissette says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-over-60" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;4. You're over 60.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="16" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About 15% of people 70–79 years old and 20% of people older than 80 years have DED, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666914523000027" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666914523000027" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows. As we age, tear production tends to decline due to a mix of factors: On top of how reduced estrogen and androgen levels affect tear quality and quantity, the meibomian glands, which produce the oil layer that prevents tear evaporation, often decline in function, and the lacrimal glands become less efficient, Dr. Brissette says. "Older adults may blink less fully, take medications that reduce tear production, or have underlying health conditions, like diabetes or autoimmune diseases," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Let's zero in on those medications: Antihistamines, antidepressants, beta-blockers, decongestants, oral contraceptives, chemotherapy medications, and isotretinoin are all examples of medications that can cause dry eye symptoms, Dr. Saini says. "They lead to symptoms primarily because they can impact the normal production of tears, either by leading to less tear production, reducing meibomian gland secretion, or affecting the composition of tears." If you're on any prescription meds and you think they may be causing dry eyes, talk to your doctor about switching to a different treatment—and try some of the helpful tips below for fast relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-have-an-autoimmune-disease" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;5. You have an autoimmune disease.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Autoimmune diseases are often linked to inflammation, which can lead to dry eyes directly and indirectly. Take Sjögren’s syndrome: It occurs when the immune system attacks the lacrimal glands, the glands that produce tears, leading to chronic dryness. But other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can also cause inflammation and damage to the tear-secreting glands, contributing to dry eye disease, Dr. Bilstrom says. "We see systemic diseases like diabetes and thyroid disease lead to decreased tear production," Dr. Saini adds. Your provider may be able to prescribe a treatment if one of these conditions is behind your dry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-work-at-a-desk-all-day" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;6. You work at a desk all day.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Staring at a screen all day isn't making matters any better for your irritated eyes. There are several factors at play here, but a major issue is that concentrating on a screen causes you to blink less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-ad-exclude="(min-width: 90rem)" data-embed="embed-product" data-node-id="24" data-theme-key="embedded-product-wrapper" size="medium" class="size-medium align-left embed css-nygxqo e1ydkxnk0"&gt;&lt;p id="product-132bb2c2-5c67-4623-a03d-26c0ca588121" data-anchor-id="product-132bb2c2-5c67-4623-a03d-26c0ca588121" class="css-17pp2fn e1ydkxnk1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div size="medium" class="size-medium align-left css-60ezry ebgq4gw4"&gt;&lt;p class="top css-1v8kzvg ebgq4gw2"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-zex8i1 e1bddzxd0"&gt;Refresh Tears Lubricant Eye Drops&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-theme-key="base-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" aria-label="$15 at Amazon for Tears Lubricant Eye Drops" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8?tag=womenshealth-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8?tag=wh-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8?tag=wh-soc-lift-20"}},"network":{"name":"Amazon"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/vaQN/amazon-refresh-tears-lubricant-eye-drops"}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$15 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008BRR8" data-vars-ga-product-brand="Refresh" data-vars-ga-product-id="132bb2c2-5c67-4623-a03d-26c0ca588121" data-vars-ga-product-price="$14.78" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="1f021180-ef47-4b88-b6d3-b2f2ce423083" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Refresh" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku="B00008BRR8" data-vars-ga-magento-tracking="1" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p size="medium" class="css-1qx21tr ebgq4gw1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"We tend to stare when we look at screens, and this lack of blinking allows the tears to evaporate in between blinks, which can accelerate irritation and microbreaks to the skin on the surface of the eye, and lead to dry eye symptoms," Dr. Saini says. A good rule of thumb is to follow the 20/20/20 rule as recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/protect-your-eyes-from-too-much-screen-time" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/protect-your-eyes-from-too-much-screen-time" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Academy of Ophthalmology" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what to do: Take a break every 20 minutes and stare off into the distance 20 feet away from you; then, blink and relax your eyes for 20 seconds. "Also, taking artificial tears if you have prolonged work to do on your computer can help if you are prone to dry eye symptoms," Dr. Saini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-live-in-a-dry-climate" data-node-id="26" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;7. You live in a dry climate.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you live in arid areas or spend a lot of time in the AC, you might experience more dry eye symptoms. Indeed, moist climates are better for people dealing with eye irritation caused by dryness, per a 2020 study in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7401914/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7401914/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Translational Vision Science &amp;amp; Technology" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="27.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="27.1.0.0"&gt;Translational Vision Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While you can't control your local weather, you can create a more humid environment—like with a humidifier—where you spend the most time, which can help with dry eye symptoms, Dr. Saini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-have-a-skin-condition-such-as-rosacea" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;8. You have a skin condition such as rosacea.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Rosacea is an inflammatory skin condition that affects the face. When it involves the eyelids, it can lead to blepharitis by causing the skin around the gland openings at the edge of the eyelid to thicken, making it harder for oil to flow out of the glands properly, Dr. Saini says. It can also cause inflammation within the glands themselves, making the meibomian secretions thicker and more waxy. This thicker oil can get trapped, leading to buildup and stagnation inside the glands, Dr. Saini says. If rosacea is the root cause of the dry eye, treating it can help with your eye-related symptoms, but you'll want to visit your ophthalmologist and/or dermatologist for an appropriate treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-had-laser-eye-surgery" data-node-id="31" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;9. You had laser eye surgery.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you've had refractive surgery, such as LASIK, PRK, or SMILE, you might notice your eyes are a bit drier. Dr. Brissette says that these laser procedures can disrupt the corneal nerves that help regulate tear production, but the effects are usually temporary. What's more, the eye drops prescribed post-surgery can disrupt the surface of the eye, potentially triggering dryness. Still, they're necessary for the healing process, so don't skip them, Dr. Brissette says. In the meantime, you can use artificial tears and follow some of the advice below to help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-treat-dry-eyes" data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0"&gt;How To Treat Dry Eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re just dealing with the occasional dry eye, consider some of the following eye-healthy habits. "As an ophthalmologist, I always emphasize that the first line of therapy for dry eye involves the basics,” Dr. Brissette says. “And, to be honest, these are practices that everyone should follow because they support overall eye health.”&lt;br data-node-id="34.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="35" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="35.0"&gt;Use preservative-free artificial tears daily, as needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="35.1"&gt;Apply warm compresses to support the meibomian glands &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="35.2"&gt;Maintain good eyelid hygiene by using an &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-dry-eye" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-dry-eye" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="eyelid cleanser" data-node-id="35.2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="35.2.1.0"&gt;eyelid cleanser&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="35.3"&gt;Stay hydrated and prioritize good nutrition (like getting enough vitamin D and omega-3s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're looking for a more lasting solution, there are some in-office treatments you can turn to. "Procedural treatments, such as punctal plugs, meibomian gland expression, or thermal pulsation therapy, are safe, quick, and effective, and can be considered at any stage," Dr. Brissette says. Prescription eye drops can also be effective. "Prescription eye drops work by improving the homeostasis of the ocular surface, helping the body produce more of its own tears and helping with surface hydration over time," Dr. Brissette says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're looking for a more lasting solution, there are some in-office treatments you can turn to.

Most of us judge a good night’s rest by how spry we feel over morning coffee, but there is a deeper story. During the night, when muscles go limp and dreams fade, the brain slips into slow-wave sleep – the quietest, most restorative phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now point to a slow erosion of that phase as a silent warning sign for dementia. The issue is not the total number of hours you sleep each night, it’s about how deeply we sleep year after year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing too much of that deep stretch appears to open the door to memory problems later in life. Even small nightly losses, study authors argue, can snowball over time and quietly shape cognitive destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-slow-wave-sleep"&gt;Understanding slow-wave sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-clears-toxic-waste-from-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, slow-wave sleep is the most restorative phase of the sleep cycle. During this stage, the brain produces slow, high-amplitude delta waves, and the body enters its most relaxed state – heart rate slows, blood pressure drops, and muscles become nearly immobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these spells, cerebrospinal fluid washes through brain tissue, sweeping away proteins such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-may-lower-levels-of-alzheimers-abnormal-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid and tau&lt;/a&gt; that gather while we are awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are major suspects in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, which already affects about one in nine Americans older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deep sleep shrinks, that nightly rinse falters. Laboratory work confirms that even a single restless night nudges amyloid levels upward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over decades, a chronic shortfall can allow debris to pile up, fraying the circuits that handle recall, planning, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-sleep-over-decades"&gt;Tracking sleep over decades&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis drawn from the &lt;a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt; followed 346 adults older than 60 who completed two overnight sleep studies five years apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 17 years, 52 of them developed dementia, and a clear pattern emerged: each 1 percent annual drop in slow-wave sleep was linked to a 27 percent increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Slow-wave sleep, or deep sleep, supports the ageing brain in many ways, and we know that sleep augments the clearance of metabolic waste from the brain, including facilitating the clearance of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease,” explained Associate Professor Matthew Pase of &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, to date we have been unsure of the role of slow-wave sleep in the development of dementia. Our findings suggest that slow-wave sleep loss may be a modifiable dementia risk factor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-sleep-and-risk"&gt;Genes, sleep, and risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same project highlighted a genetic wildcard: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APOE ε4&lt;/a&gt;. Carriers of this variant lost deep sleep faster than their peers. Even without that gene, though, a steep decline in slow-wave minutes still spelled trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain-volume measurements did not explain the trend, hinting that sleep itself is the driver. By tracking nightly brain waves, clinicians may gain an early heads-up long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-slow-wave-sleep"&gt;Studying slow-wave sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;, shows how deep sleep might soften the blow even when pathology is already in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-two older volunteers spent a night undergoing electroencephalography and then tried to match names to faces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with heavy beta-amyloid deposits but plentiful slow-wave sleep performed as well as participants with cleaner brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a certain level of brain pathology, you’re not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues,” said &lt;a href="https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-zsofia-zavecz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zsófia Zavecz&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley’s &lt;a href="https://www.humansleepscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Human Sleep Science&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should be aware that, despite having a certain level of pathology, there are certain lifestyle factors that will help moderate and decrease the effects. One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-memory-afloat"&gt;Keeping memory afloat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/matthew-p-walker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Walker&lt;/a&gt;, senior author of the UC Berkeley study, posed a compelling question: If sleep is truly essential for memory, could it be a missing piece in the puzzle explaining why two people with the same level of amyloid pathology experience such different memory outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that if this theory proves true, it would be exciting – because sleep is something we can actually change. It’s a modifiable factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker went on to compare deep sleep to a life raft: it keeps memory afloat rather than letting it sink under the weight of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-disruptions-could-signal-the-onset-of-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested that non-REM, slow-wave sleep may be a crucial piece in understanding cognitive reserve. Even better, it’s something we can improve, even later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-more-slow-wave-sleep"&gt;Getting more slow-wave sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory gadgets cannot guarantee longer slow-wave stretches, yet everyday choices matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular bedtimes anchor the body clock; a cool, dark bedroom keeps overheating at bay; and avoiding caffeine after lunch reduces late-night jitters. A warm shower before lights-out also nudges the brain toward &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-how-slow-waves-boost-memory-formation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deeper stages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the advantages of this result is the application to a huge population right above the age of 65,” Zavecz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By sleeping better and doing your best to practice good sleep hygiene, which is easy to research online, you can gain the benefit of this compensatory function against this type of Alzheimer’s pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable sensors are not perfect, but they now offer a glimpse into nightly slow-wave trends at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding and supporting this critical stage of sleep through consistent habits and healthy routines, we gain a powerful, accessible tool for maintaining cognitive resilience well into older adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting a downward drift early gives older adults a chance to course-correct with simple habits – an investment that could pay off in sharper memories for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2810957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 22:10:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPZkFLam1GN2NFZkNydWJraEZYRUNSdW54N2psejN3VnBQVEtvZUpkWndvLW1QUTg5bzh6bkFEN0pLMFRzUGxIZmM4NTdPamJQR0NUMURacmdkWVJQYUhqbk5EaklRdWtRLVZrVjNCTF9QczlBc3lvYWJuUWtkQkJaU2lZTS0tZUtZdnBUcTM2NVo1bDRETHZzeU9ndHRraTZIWnpWeHlkT1NEdUE3YXV5VQ</guid></item><item><title>黑人患者经常晚期诊断出致命的皮肤癌--《华盛顿邮报》 | Too often, Black patients get late diagnoses of deadly skin cancer - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOWGlSRHhIRkxfR1E5a09XQzlOR1d2eTBuSzd5b0FQaGEtaDR6b2MxZVlnUHJaOGFaX1duS0RmOHpndmxHZURCN2VoRm5sZk9DaGJxUUVXYVhKcm1xeWxlWkpKczJPQTB2M3dvQnVJSWlwWVExd3RobGxUWDlRMVJSTmJPZFM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5CP6PJA2EFCQPIF2WL33ED47QE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TV5NRTMZRRCKNEZ3NAFUT27HNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The abundance in Black skin of melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, offers extra protection from damaging ultraviolet rays.

A dark spot under his toenail that Marley believed to be the result of a soccer injury was eventually diagnosed as acral lentiginous melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TZ6MFI4UOVEQ3PCC4U3FTSSGLE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;ALM is an aggressive cancer that usually appears as a freckle or dark brown spot or patch on the palms or the soles of the feet, or as a band running lengthwise under a nail — rather than on parts of the body that are more exposed to sunlight, where melanoma is usually found on lighter skin. Though it can occur in anyone, ALM is the most common type of malignant melanoma among people with darker skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RZE67EUC7ZB5BHRLPBOOUJRSXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Why does ALM often go unrecognized until it’s too late? For starters, the characteristics of ALM aren’t covered under the widely disseminated early detection strategy known as the &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/are-moles-cancerous.h00-159463212.html" target="_blank"&gt;ABCDEs of melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, which since 1985 has encouraged the public to check for moles that are: Asymmetrical; have blurry, scalloped or jagged Borders; are multi- or haphazardly Colored; are larger than 6 millimeters in Diameter (a little bigger than a pencil eraser); or Evolve in size, shape or feeling. (ALM has its own diagnostic acronym, which we’ll get to below.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YI4U446UTBBWNABEV4OQSXFVQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Dermatologists should know to look for ALM, of course, especially when examining people of color. But it seems the medical community may not be doing a good enough job spreading the word among practitioners. A 2012 study in the journal Dermatology Clinic reported that in a recent survey, 47 percent of dermatologists and dermatology residents reported that their medical school or residency program offered inadequate training on skin conditions in Black people. It wasn’t until a decade later that the American Academy of Dermatology introduced the &lt;a href="https://learning.aad.org/Listing/Skin-of-Color-Curriculum-5719" target="_blank"&gt;Skin of Color Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; to train residents and practicing dermatologists on dermatologic conditions of the skin, hair and nails in patients with skin of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SMG7ZVILVFFXROP3BOTKKSJV5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The problem seems to be compounded by a consistent lack of images in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647521000538#bib0002" target="_blank"&gt;dermatology textbooks&lt;/a&gt; and a lack of skin-of-color-focused articles in top &lt;a href="https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(22)00521-7/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;dermatology journals&lt;/a&gt;. (When I did a Google image search using the query “What does skin cancer look like?” I had to scroll through 10 pages of results before a single image of a Black person appeared.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZPXLPWKXAFBAXFZ2QCXB3ARYJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Because there are a dearth of images of skin cancer on dark skin, doctors and patients are less aware of what it looks like, leading to delays in recognition and treatment,” says Adewole Adamson, board-certified dermatologist and assistant professor in the department of internal medicine at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q4Y6Z7GR4JB7DESAYJVMXXR2U4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Efforts are underway to address the issue. On Instagram, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brownskinmatters/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Brown Skin Matters&lt;/a&gt; encourages its 118,000 followers to submit photos to create an image bank of what various dermatological conditions look like on skin of color. It was started by a mother who searched online for “eczema on infant” and noticed that none of the images she found looked like her biracial son’s symptoms. And in 2020, an international team of medical educators launched &lt;a href="https://dftbskindeep.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Skin Deep&lt;/a&gt;, a free, open-access medical education resource featuring photographs of dermatological conditions on a range of skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OWZLNJMQEZHLFDK5XV4FWGPYNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A lack of diversity among dermatologists may also play a role in delaying ALM diagnoses. One 2020 JAMA study shows improved patient experience when physicians shared a racial/ethnic background with their patients. Yet only 3 percent of dermatologists in the United States are Black, while Black people make up 13 percent of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OAJFLI2UDBF7BH25J2BFCVX2Y4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OAJFLI2UDBF7BH25J2BFCVX2Y4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to check for ALM&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E6HMYD3PC5DZ7N2UDNHRRFEJPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Regardless of the reasons for delayed ALM diagnoses, there are simple ways anyone can decrease their own risk. Early detection is key. Here’s what to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q6VWGEISK5DRNIOBHVLVEF2W5U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perform regular self-checks. The AAD recommends using a &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/find/check-skin" target="_blank"&gt;full-length mirror to check your entire body&lt;/a&gt; for spots, moles, discoloration, rough or dry patches, and sores that won’t heal or that heal and then return. A handheld mirror will let you examine hard-to-see areas like the top of the head, back, groin, buttocks and behind the ears. (You can also enlist help from a loved one.)

Pay close attention to any narrow dark streaks in a nail not caused by an accident. On the surface of the foot, an ALM lesion could be flat, even as the tumor grows deep into the skin. The Foundation also cautions that thickening ALM is sometimes mistaken for a plantar wart on the sole of the foot and can make walking painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F6UT35OV75BZZDWCTPPVISAA7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keeping a close watch on your own body parts is critical, but if you use a manicurist or pedicurist, they can also be helpful in spotting abnormalities on your hands and feet and under the nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GXHVUQPCGRD6RIX6NMFKPD23YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find a dermatologist who is familiar with darker skin.&lt;/b&gt; Various institutions and individuals are working to bring dermatologists up to speed when it comes to communities of color. The Skin of Color Society is a member organization with a directory of physicians and board-certified dermatologists promoting awareness in skin-of-color dermatology. And there are a growing number of academic “ethnic skin centers” in the U.S. that focus on the care and research of conditions common among people of color, preparing residents to treat skin of color and educating the medical community and public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K62JWRU7OVGAFESHWW6A74TGVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect your skin from the sun&lt;/b&gt;. Recognizing that Black people tend to get melanomas on body parts that solar rays don’t typically reach is important, but dark-skinned people still must protect themselves from direct sunlight. Even the darkest skin has a natural sun protection factor of only 13, according to the Dermatology Education Foundation — while the AAD recommends correct consistent use of broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZL52CBSEWJGFBLFIT7IC6F5PEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For some people of color, sunscreen is a hard sell. “The acceptance of sunscreen use by people with skin of color has been at least in part affected by challenges finding sunscreen formulations that do not leave a visible cast,” Alexis says. Sunscreen can manifest on darker complexions as a white overtone that makes skin look like a powdered doughnut — but some are better than others in this respect. In &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/sunscreens/best-sunscreens-for-people-with-dark-skin-a3894284440/" target="_blank"&gt;a Consumer Reports evaluation&lt;/a&gt;, 83 people with olive to deep-brown complexions were asked to judge the look and feel of 21 sunscreens on their skin. The participants found several products that absorbed quickly and did not make their skin look chalky or ashy, including Black Girl Sunscreen Kids Spray &amp;amp; Play SPF 50 and Supergoop Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ARPMQ5MQRDEFMHZV7DAG4F664" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, limiting your skin’s exposure to the sun, by either staying in the shade or wearing protective clothing, can also mitigate the risk of developing skin &lt;a href="http://cancer.to/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

Despite how many times you say to yourself, “I should get a new one,” you never do — but now, it’s officially time to buy a replacement. Research published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37220346/" target="_blank"&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, found that plastic cutting boards release tiny pieces of plastic when you chop on them, which can end up in your food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9817e" class="body-graf"&gt;Before you start panicking, keep reading — I talked to cooking experts and engineers about whether plastic cutting boards are safe to use, and the best alternatives to buy if you want to reduce your exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65e272" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want more from NBC Select? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/nbc-news-select-signup-pd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-5e8c90" id="anchor-5e8c90" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Are plastic cutting boards safe to use?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b227ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Long story short, yes, plastic cutting boards are generally safe to use, according to all the experts I spoke to. However, they can cause microplastics (particles that have a diameter between 1 and 5 mm.) to end up in your food. As a knife’s blade scratches a plastic cutting board’s surface, tiny pieces of plastic get released that stick to your ingredients — they’re too small to see, so you may ingest them, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/chemical/profiles/shetty-manish.html" target="_blank"&gt;Manish Shetty&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. Particles that stick to the knife’s blade or cutting board go down the drain when you clean them, so there’s an environmental impact to consider, too. That said, how worried should you be? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-322d5d" class="body-graf"&gt;“According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37220346/" target="_blank"&gt;the study’s&lt;/a&gt; estimation, people could be exposed to about 50 grams of microplastics per year through plastic cutting boards, which seems like a huge amount, but isn’t compared to other sources of microplastics you’re exposed to,” says Wei. “The study also didn’t find any toxicity effects, which is a good sign, and indicates that this is a safe process.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-286bc9" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s important to note, however, that the study’s findings are limited — researchers conducted testing on mice and only tracked health effects for about three days after exposure. Plus, microplastics are difficult to quantify — if another team of researchers did the same study, their findings may vary, says &lt;a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/cee/Faculty/Wei_Haoran/" target="_blank"&gt;Hoaran Wei&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Additional research will allow scientists to make more definitive assessments, but this study is a good starting point. “It makes us think a lot more about our sources of consumption,” says Shetty. “When you talk about microplastics impacting the environment, it can feel like an arm’s length away, if not more. But when you talk about human health, it feels a lot closer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7b68c" class="body-graf"&gt;The overall takeaway? You’re exposed to microplastics while using plastic cutting boards, but, as far as researchers can tell right now, not in an excessive amount that could pose health risks, says Wei. You can use a cutting board made from an alternative material if you want to cut down your microplastic exposure (I break down the best options&lt;a href="#anchor-774177"&gt; below&lt;/a&gt;), but all materials have benefits and drawbacks you’ll need to weigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-658d96" id="anchor-658d96" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How I picked the best plastic cutting board alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edebdd" class="body-graf"&gt;While shopping for plastic cutting board alternatives, experts recommend thinking about the following factors, all of which I considered while curating my picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-7c9dbc" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of plastic, choose a cutting board made from wood, rubber, silicone or composite, all of which are food-safe and gentle on knives, experts say. Never use a glass, stone or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-stainless-steel-cookware-rcna169399" target="_blank"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt; cutting board — these materials are very hard on knives and can damage their blades, says &lt;a href="https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/Tracy.Zimmermann95" target="_blank"&gt;Tracy Zimmermann&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of hospitality management who teaches culinary arts at the New York City College of Technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care&lt;/strong&gt;: Rubber, silicone and composite cutting boards are easier to clean compared to wood options, says Zimmermann. They’re dishwasher-safe and you can sanitize them with a chemical solution if needed. Wood has antibacterial properties that don’t allow bacteria to grow and fester, but you can’t put these types of cutting boards in the dishwasher or use chemical sanitizers on them. Instead, you hand-wash them with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-dish-soap-ncna1304079" target="_blank"&gt;dish soap&lt;/a&gt; and water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;: Once there’s deep scratches and nicks, lingering odors or permanent stains on the surface of a rubber, silicone or composite cutting board, you need to retire it. However, you can sand down the surface of wood cutting boards as they get scratched and nicked, so you don’t have to replace them as often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-774177" id="anchor-774177" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;The best plastic cutting board alternatives for your kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8e5d6" class="body-graf"&gt;To recommend the best plastic cutting board alternatives, I rounded up options that meet expert guidance. A few also come recommended by chefs or the NBC Select staff. I didn’t include any rubber cutting boards below — they’re a great alternative for plastic boards, but experts say they’re most often used in professional kitchens, not at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-dfa109" id="anchor-dfa109" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best wood&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-ef43d3"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd53182" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print mv8 product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-john-boos-chop-n-slice-series,-maple-wood-cutting-board-" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="productSpecs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;maple wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;16 inches by 10 inches &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Thickness:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;1-inch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Dishwasher-safe:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt; no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-john-boos-chop-n-slice-series,-maple-wood-cutting-board-"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-lasting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thick and sturdy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Double-sided&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must hand-wash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needs oiling or conditioning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easily absorbs moisture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5456e2" class="body-graf"&gt;“Wood is always a great choice due to its antimicrobial properties,” says Zimmermann. “It also has a better feel and is easier on knife blades compared to plastic.” However, these types of cutting boards require some upkeep — you need to oil or condition them periodically to make sure they stay in good shape. Additionally, wood cutting boards absorb moisture, so they’re not great for cutting ingredients like raw meat and fish, says Alycia Johnson, vice president of merchandising at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;amp;id=96128X1608993&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surlatable.com%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoosQJejzm37lH97khOBaAqHKdXC_tFk-nbYwaAnFLzW_ekL4VWR&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fselect%2Fshopping%2Fplasticcuttingboardsaltrcna213278" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-commerce-encoding="true" data-seller-id="ncrg1099366"&gt;Sur La Table&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, there are knife marks here and there, but overall, it looks great compared to others I’ve tried.” The brand recommends oiling its cutting board at least once a month and conditioning it for additional protection — you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/John-Boos-MYSCRMAPP-Cutting-Maintenance/dp/B075FH66NQ?tag=plasticcuttingboardsaltrcna213278-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-commerce-encoding="true" data-seller-id="ncrg916911"&gt;care set&lt;/a&gt; separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-b94721"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/250613-plastic-cutting-board-inline-f7aa0e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250613-plastic-cutting-board-inline-f7aa0e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/250613-plastic-cutting-board-inline-f7aa0e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250613-plastic-cutting-board-inline-f7aa0e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250613-plastic-cutting-board-inline-f7aa0e.jpg" alt="NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio uses her Boos board daily, so she leaves it out on her countertop at all times."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio uses her Boos board daily, so she leaves it out on her countertop at all times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Mili Godio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-de7b97" id="anchor-de7b97" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best composite&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-b37014"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd53183" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print mv8 product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-epicurean-kitchen-series-cutting-board" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="productSpecs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;richlite paper composite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;14.5 inches by 11.3 inches &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Thickness:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;0.25 inches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Dishwasher-safe:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-epicurean-kitchen-series-cutting-board"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can use as a trivet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stain-resistant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Double-sided&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heat-resistant, not oven-safe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc3ce3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Composite wood fiber cutting boards are quite popular right now because they’re so durable and good on your knives,” says Johnson. “They’re also really easy to clean since you can throw them in the dishwasher.” Zimmermann specifically recommends Epicurean’s composite cutting board, which I also own. “I’ve had it for quite a while and it cuts well, is lightweight and more eco-friendly than plastic,” says Zimmermann. The non-porous boards have a smooth feel and are double-sided, plus there’s a hole to hang them from. They’re heat-resistant up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, so they double as a trivet, and come in four sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-9ce8be" id="anchor-9ce8be" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best silicone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-7e728e"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd53184" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print mv8 product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-liflicon-silicone-thick-cutting-board-mats-set" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="productSpecs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;silicone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;varies, three sizes in set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Thickness:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;varies per size board&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Dishwasher-safe:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-liflicon-silicone-thick-cutting-board-mats-set"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-slip grip on bottom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Juice groove&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can use as trivet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible material&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heat-resistant, not oven-safe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e56d56" class="body-graf"&gt;Similar to wood, silicone has some give, making it easy on knife blades, and similar to plastic, it’s dishwasher-safe and inexpensive, says Zimmermann. However, silicone isn’t the sturdiest material, so when you pick the board up, it tends to bend. That might be appealing to you — you can fold silicone cutting boards horizontally or vertically to create a funnel of sorts, making it convenient to dump food into pans or scraps into the trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ce0b6" class="body-graf"&gt;This set comes with three thick silicone cutting boards in small, medium and large sizes. The boards are stain- and stick-resistant, according to the brand, and double-sided: the top has a smooth surface with juice grooves, while the bottom is textured to help it grip to your countertop. Each board also has a hole to hang it from. They’re heat-resistant up to 482 degrees Fahrenheit, so they double as trivets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-e8d11c" id="anchor-e8d11c" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best for small spaces&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-768a13"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd53185" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print mv8 product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-caraway-small-cutting-board-" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="productSpecs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matetial:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;birch wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 inches by 7 inches &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Thickness:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;0.5 inches thick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;strong&gt;Dishwasher-safe:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-caraway-small-cutting-board-"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indent for juices &amp;amp; bowls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Durable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil and wax finish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mush hand-wash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easily absorbs moisture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needs oiling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea35f5" class="body-graf"&gt;I own numerous cutting boards, but this is by far the one I use most in my small kitchen. It’s the ideal size for my limited countertop space, and it’s quite durable — I’ve sliced fruits, vegetables, cheese and breads on it almost daily for over a year, and it’s still in great condition. The cutting board is finished with food-safe mineral oil and wax, and it has a small indent in one corner to collect juices or put a small bowl of dip or sauce if you’re serving on it. You can buy Caraway’s small cutting board individually or purchase it as part of the brand’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLWNSJFF?tag=plasticcuttingboardsaltrcna213278-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-commerce-encoding="true" data-seller-id="ncrg916911"&gt;three-piece set&lt;/a&gt;, which also comes with a storage organizer.

Plus, it has internal steel beams to prevent it from warping, according to the brand. Each of the board’s sides is made from a different material: one side is wood and the other is composite, giving you the benefits of both. The composite side has a groove around its perimeter to catch juices, and the board’s angled sides make it easy to grab, flip and move as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-195519" class="body-graf"&gt;NBC Select reporter &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/harry-rabinowitz-ncpn1291108" target="_blank"&gt;Harry Rabinowitz&lt;/a&gt; uses Steelport’s board to cook for his family (the brand sent him a courtesy sample).

Doing so allows you to designate a board per each task, like one for chopping fruits and vegetables, and another for slicing raw meat and fish. If you only have one cutting board, it’s important to clean it between cutting different types of ingredients, and pay attention to the order you prepare foods in. “If you’re making vegetables and meat, for example, I recommend cutting all the vegetables first and then focusing on the meats,” says Guzzle. “Meat can present a higher bacterial risk when it comes to cutting boards, so you want to take care of that last.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do microplastics come from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-element-id="75c689"&gt;“Any time we use plastics, there’s a potential for microplastics,” says Shetty. They’re released by products we use every day, like plastic cutting boards and containers, cling wrap and detergent pods, as well as other sources. Wastewater treatment plants, for example, transports microplastic particles to freshwater supplies and sea water bodies, says Wei. Some microplastics also come from stormwater runoff. “When it rains, for example, plastic particles on the road from tire particles will be washed into natural water bodies,” he says. Microplastics are made in water bodies, too. “We have a lot of floating plastic garbage in the sea and freshwater, and they can degrade, breaking apart into tiny little particles,” says Wei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are microplastics dangerous?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-element-id="e33eb7"&gt;Microplastics only accumulate — they never disappear, says Wei. “They can last for hundreds of years in the environment, break down, become carbon dioxide and be released back into the atmosphere, which is a very slow process, making microplastics persistent contaminants,” he says. The concentration of microplastics in the environment is constantly increasing, so people are being exposed to them more and more. And recently, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11342020/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; are showing that there’s microplastics present in the human body, which is likely because the particles are in our food and drinking water, says Wei. Scientists and doctors are currently researching the toxicity of microplastics on the human body, especially how it impacts reproductivity, inflammatory response, liver health and kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/best-plastic-cutting-board-alternatives-rcna213278#anchor-cb8e85" id="anchor-cb8e85" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Meet our experts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16e3f1" class="body-graf"&gt;At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination. If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended. Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This is the third rabid fox bite reported this month. A &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/raleigh-rabies-wild-fox-june-2025/"&gt;fox bit someone on Camille Court near Hunting Ridge Road&lt;/a&gt;
in Raleigh, and another one &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/cumberland-county-rabies-case-fox-bite-fayetteville-june-2025/"&gt;bit a home inspector in Fayetteville&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent study, participants were asked to forget one of two items and later tested on the remaining relevant memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans showed that removing memory content involves reduced excitability in the neural circuits tied to the unwanted information. These findings offer insight into how the brain actively clears space in memory and may help explain how people manage intrusive thoughts or harmful recollections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Forgetting:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain can intentionally suppress memory traces using specific neural mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circuit Deactivation:&lt;/strong&gt; Forgetting is associated with reduced excitability in brain regions linked to the forgotten item.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; This mechanism may help manage intrusive thoughts, rumination, or hallucinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing information from memories may help people retain what they want to remember. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies focus on how the brain removes information by subconsciously not paying attention to these details, but sometimes there is a need to consciously remove unneeded details from memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110930"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-forgetting-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings indicate a mechanism linked to consciously removing information from a memory: less excitable brain circuits that initially process unneeded memory content. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when details in a memory are perceptibly harmful and lead to, for example, people combating rumination, intrusive negative thoughts, or hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/em&gt;paper, Jiangang Shan and Bradley Postle, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explored how the brain actively removes unneeded memory content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recorded the brain activity of nearly 30 study participants as they performed a memory task. In this task, participants were initially given two items to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental conditions either did or did not encourage participants to actively remove the memory of one of these items. Following these conditions, they were given a third item to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants were tested on their memory of the relevant first and final items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate a mechanism linked to consciously removing information from a memory: less excitable brain circuits that initially process unneeded memory content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81ece4e5e8e0c1f2e7efafeef3e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2414-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EEG Correlates of Active Removal from Working Memory&lt;/a&gt;” by Jiangang Shan et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EEG Correlates of Active Removal from Working Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of no-longer-relevant information from visual working memory (WM) is important for the functioning of WM, given its severe capacity limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, with an “ABC-retrocuing” WM task, we have shown that removing information can be accomplished in different ways: by simply withdrawing attention from the newly irrelevant memory item (IMI; i.e., via “passive removal”); or by or “actively” removing the IMI from WM (Shan and Postle, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms behind active removal, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from human subjects (both sexes) performing the ABC-retrocuing task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we tested the hijacked adaptation model, which posits that active removal is accomplished by a top-down-triggered down-modulation of the gain of perceptual circuits, such that sensory channels tuned to the to-be-removed information become less sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, analyses revealed that, relative to passive removal, active removal produced a decline in the familiarity landscape centered on the IMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurally, we focused on two epochs of the task, corresponding to the triggering, and to the consequence, of active removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to triggering, we observed a stronger anterior-to-posterior traveling wave for active versus passive removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the consequence(s) of removal, the response to a task-irrelevant “ping” was reduced for active removal, as assessed with ERP, suggesting that active removal led to decreased excitability in perceptual circuits centered on the IMI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 20:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9vVTlGbUtmdDJxaTlNcU5lODhkS1ZYQjBrUXMxelBJOFJQNVpkTXd5VzdGajF4dmVZdHZRMmhDTGRxVzR1V0xNOXdkV1YybU1jNk1RakxrQ0pWMjJFeWdtcy11Z3FoMTQ</guid></item><item><title>斯坦福大学的研究人员开发出“改变游戏规则”的中风治疗方法，将疗效提高一倍-福克斯新闻 | Stanford researchers develop ‘game-changing’ stroke treatment that doubles effectiveness - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOdEM0NDh1Z010Q1MydWpNZDJvWXdET0VqNGVZWHZVcmhtU0lEaDJTTXZNd0M2SVpoVjdMNEdxYkFkT2JMTkowcC1FRGRhbXh6R0w2Q3YwcDBabWNlN1pzNUdlSXpGczh0RG1FWjZmcG9BVE5XSVEwYkVtM1B3TDd1cXVKNXVPTUEya1VRWHBWUW9uSkdyYUxaM0E3UTdFUWtZQlRmZlh4VlJtY2hCbUhoZmtR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;div class="contain" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;   &lt;div class="info" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;p data-v-5f342d4c&gt;Preston Patton was just 6 years old when he suffered a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain.

                        &lt;p&gt;PHOENIX – Local health officials announced Monday that a person infected with the measles traveled through Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maricopa County Department of Public Health said the public exposure occurred between 5 p.m. and midnight on June 10 in Concourses C and D of Terminal 4, beyond the security checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MCDPH is coordinating with other agencies to notify people who may have been exposed so they can watch for symptoms and get care if any develop,” Dr. Nick Staab, MCDPH chief medical officer, &lt;a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3347" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With a virus as highly infectious as measles, it’s a reminder that we all should stay up-to-date on our vaccines to keep ourselves and those around us safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a passenger is confirmed to have measles, anyone who was on the same plane will be notified by local health officials, per routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is both highly contagious and preventable,” Staab said. “It can cause severe illness, including death, so we strongly encourage anyone who has not been vaccinated to get vaccinated to prevent further spread.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How many measles cases are confirmed in Arizona in 2025?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of June 9, the Arizona Department of Health Services &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;had confirmed&lt;/a&gt; four cases of measles in the state, &lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-news/measles-arizona-2025/5715628/" target="_blank"&gt;all in Navajo County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,197 &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-vaccination-rfk-mmr-e5d928e41fd6b3dc6ade087662d61c5c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed cases this year&lt;/a&gt; nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vaccination rates declining since COVID pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid the ailment is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over 88% of Arizona’s kindergarten students had two doses of the MMR vaccine in the 2023-24 school year, per the &lt;a href="https://apps.azdhs.gov/IDRREportStats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most recent data available&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of young men's focus might be on developing their career, their day-to-day life. That's a very different track of mind than perhaps your health.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the survey, researchers questioned 1,008 adults in the US — of whom just under half were men while the rest were women. Half were also under the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that just over half of respondents said it was important to carry out monthly checks for the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only 13 percent said that testicular cancer was most commonly affecting men under 30 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 63 percent correctly noted the disease was more likely to be curable if it was caught early, and 18 percent wrongly suggested the disease was always painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common symptoms of the disease include a lump or swelling in the scrotum or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the cancer has a five-year survival rate of about 95 percent if it is caught in the early stages before it has spread in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it spreads, however, this drops to 73 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dason added: 'We are really fortunate in testicular cancer that the vast majority of patients are diagnosed at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means the vast majority of patients are actually diagnosed before the cancer has had an opportunity to spread to other parts of the body.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that testicular cancer affects younger men because it predominantly affects the germ cells, or the reproductive cells that make sperm, which are most active at this age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that people who are taller, from a White ethnic background and have a family history of the disease have a higher risk, although some studies suggest that being overweight does not raise the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And rates are now rising, which is now thought to be due to a mixture of better screening and linked to the broader rises in cancer diagnoses among young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lance Armstrong, a famous cyclist, was also diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996 at the age of 25 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bco2.451?af=R#:~:text=Increasing%20trend%20in%20men%20under,000%20and%209.3/100%20000."&gt;2024 study &lt;/a&gt;on testicular cancer in California found that, among those under 39 years old, the rate of the cancers had risen by about 10 percent in two decades from six to 7.3 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D198;jsessionid=F04AB58A678D6E0634B6BD8E417A"&gt;Data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt; also shows an uptick in testicular cancer cases in the age group, with the rate rising from 6.3 to 6.8 cases per 100,000 men aged 0 to 39 years from 1999 to 2021 — the latest date available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First line of treatment for the disease is surgery, with doctors normally removing the tumor and testicle that is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further tests are then carried out to establish whether the disease has spread, before other treatments are offered like surgery to remove lymph nodes and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those to have previously battled the cancer is cyclist Lance Armstrong, who was diagnosed with the disease in 1996 at the age of 25 years, and five-time Olympic Gold Medalist Nathan Adrian, who was diagnosed at age 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 6ft 6in swimmer was diagnosed with stage two testicular cancer in December 2018 amid training for Tokyo 2020 — saying he went to doctors after feeling something swollen and hard in his scrotum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had surgery to remove the tumor in his scrotum a few weeks later and, after further tests, also had a second surgery to remove some lymph nodes that were feared to also contain the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;JMichael Shipman, from Texas, was also diagnosed with the cancer at the age of 21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was back swimming a few weeks later, and said that he will now monitor for any new cancers via surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another case, JMichael Shipman revealed in 2018 that he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 21 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Texas local said he booked into MD Anderson Cancer Center after finding a large lump on his right testicle in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two days later he was put through for surgery, and then had one round of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also froze his sperm before the chemotherapy after being told that the regimen could make a man infertile for up to two years. It isn't clear whether he's now had children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Ohio State University survey was &lt;span&gt;conducted between May 2 and 5 this year using the SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus, a twice-monthly survey of a representative sample of the US public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the respondents, 978 filled in answers to the questions via the web while 30 responded via the telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 18:17:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOcGhieHYzNHdSX0Y5a3g2bTFYNzl6WmM4YnBIZzFSMXhWeVI3OGhVdEhQX3VzbmVTc3ZfQzV2aUFsR1pwWG5MSnVWUDBCdGhvS1NWWnFUWEdFWXlpYjNlQXNzYzJpS3Z0RjREV05hYUZZXzZWRmtLMlVHS05kSkZsSUNsQWVISmlURUN3VmhXNGsydkR3cVhycWVfNNIBoAFBVV95cUxPMDNUQTNVQmJjUlo5U0x1b0kxOU1xQW8zZ19BaU41SkNTTzdNczgyVVdCT01FRzhLdXgtWWxjb0NCVWExOW8ydVcySXEydkRaRVh3bFJoS19SRmswWkNCVHhwSE1YZjdJN19Zb3p5dHlOV2x0MzFfRnZYWUMyR2VaRXljN2VxTnNyU1JkOHJIUjhmcWZEek9mM0djcG5POE1l</guid></item><item><title>科学家警告说，痴呆症风险始于童年，而不是老年- PsyPost | Dementia risk begins in childhood, not old age, scientists warn - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNR29haDlKNEtDbElaa2NfYWlBdU1mT2p5LUg5YjRpTHZSbVRjTlNIUUhQbE1iVC1RS1NYZ1ZmNFlzVGV6cTZKN1FXaEQzanhBNVFyOEhmX2pYUkhCRnlHQjdSY2c1WGlvNDVDRTJkZnphSkJ5dThOX0U1YXQtRXlZTmxIX0cyXzFYTVVOQlQ3TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34337138/"&gt;60 million people&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to be living with dementia, resulting in over 1.5 million deaths a year and an annual cost to the global healthcare economy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;US $1.3 trillion&lt;/a&gt; (almost £1 trillion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of scientific research and billions of pounds of investment, dementia still has no cure. But what of the old saying that prevention is better than cure? Is preventing dementia possible? And if so, at what age should we be taking steps to do so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite what many believe, dementia is not simply an unavoidable consequence of ageing or genetics. It is estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;up to 45%&lt;/a&gt; of dementia cases could potentially be prevented by reducing exposure to 14 modifiable risk factors common throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these risk factors – which include things like obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking – are traditionally studied from middle age (around 40 to 60 years old) onwards. As a result, several of the world’s leading health bodies and dementia charities now recommend that strategies aimed at reducing dementia risk should &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk"&gt;ideally be targeted at this age&lt;/a&gt; to reap the greatest benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;We argue&lt;/a&gt;, however, that targeting even younger ages is likely to provide greater benefits still. But how young are we talking? And why would exposure to risk factors many decades before the symptoms of dementia traditionally appear be important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain, let’s work backwards from middle age, starting with the three decades covering adolescence and young adulthood (from ten to 40 years old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many lifestyle-related dementia risk factors emerge during the teenage years, then persist into adulthood. For example, 80% of adolescents &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26696565/"&gt;living with obesity&lt;/a&gt; will remain this way when they are adults. The same applies to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19455"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01259-9/abstract"&gt;lack of exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, virtually all adults who smoke or drink will have &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/uploads/Youth-Smoking-Fact-Sheet.pdf?v=1741882326"&gt;started these unhealthy habits&lt;/a&gt; in or around adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This poses two potential issues when considering middle age as the best starting point for dementia-prevention strategies. First, altering health behaviour that has already been established is notoriously difficult. And second, most high-risk individuals targeted in middle age will almost certainly have been exposed to the damaging effects of these risk factors for many decades already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the most effective actions are likely to be those aimed at preventing unhealthy behaviour in the first place, rather than attempting to change long-established habits decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The roots of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about even earlier in people’s lives? Could the roots of dementia stretch as far back as childhood or infancy? &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;Increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests yes, and that risk factor exposures in the first decade of life (or even while in the womb) may have lifelong implications for dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why this may be, it’s important to remember that our brain goes through three major periods during our lives – development in early life, a period of relative stability in adult life, and decline (in some functions) in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most dementia research understandably focuses on changes associated with that decline in later life. But there is &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.084318"&gt;increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that many of the differences in brain structure and function associated with dementia in older adults may have at least partly existed since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in long-term studies where people have had their cognitive ability tracked across their whole lives, &lt;a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-7-28"&gt;one of the most important factors&lt;/a&gt; explaining someone’s cognitive ability at age 70 is their cognitive ability when they were 11. That is, older adults with poorer cognitive skills have often had these lower skills since childhood, rather than the differences being solely due to a faster decline in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns are also seen when looking for evidence of dementia-related damage on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;brain scans&lt;/a&gt;, with some changes appearing to be more closely related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/148/1/133/7695855"&gt;risk factor exposures in early life&lt;/a&gt; than current unhealthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, perhaps the time has come for dementia prevention to be thought of as a lifelong goal, rather than simply a focus for old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A lifelong prevention plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we achieve this in practical terms? Complex problems require complex solutions, and there is no quick fix to address this challenge. Many factors contribute to increasing or decreasing an individual’s dementia risk – there is no “one size fits all” approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one thing generally agreed upon is that mass medication of young people is not the answer. Instead, we – along with 33 other leading international researchers in the field of dementia – recently published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;set of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for actions that can be taken at the individual, community and national levels to improve brain health from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our consensus statement and recommendations deliver two clear messages. First, meaningful reductions in dementia risk for as many people as possible will only be achievable through a coordinated approach that brings together healthier environments, better education and smarter public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second – and perhaps most importantly – while it’s never too late to take steps to reduce your risk of dementia, it’s also never too early to start.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255845/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255845/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;p&gt;“It’s the neuronal equivalent of being so stressed that you catch a cold,” Kevin Rhine, PhD, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral research fellow at University of California (UC) San Diego’s Sanford Stem Cell Innovation Center, said in a &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/molecular-stress-in-old-neurons-increases-susceptibility-to-neurodegenerative-diseases-study-finds"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01952-z"&gt;Neuronal aging causes mislocalization of splicing proteins and unchecked cellular stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Aged neurons appear to forget about stress response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people grow older, their risk of developing Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases increases. Such diseases drive “a substantial portion of the public health burden,” the researchers wrote. However, what exactly happens inside aged neurons remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aging has been a black box for a long time,” said Gene Yeo, PhD, who led the study. “Nobody is really sure what an aged neuron looks like, how it behaves, or how it’s different from a young neuron.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeo is director of the Sanford Stem Cell Innovation Center and a professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, Yeo’s team collected skin cells from healthy elderly people and reprogrammed them into neurons while maintaining any signs of aging. The researchers then compared these lab-grown aged neurons to brain tissue from both humans and mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these aged neurons, the activity of more than 4,000 genes changed. Specifically, while genes for RNA-binding proteins, which help process the way cells edit genetic instructions before using them, were still present, the actual helper proteins were found at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these proteins were no longer in the cell’s nucleus, where they normally work, and had moved to the cytoplasm, the fluid part of the cell outside its nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We think that aged neurons are prioritizing other proteins and forgetting about the stress response and about RNA-binding proteins that keep everything running smoothly,” Yeo said. Without enough of these proteins, neurons can’t properly edit genetic instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Key protein missing from stress granules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One protein researchers found to be behaving unusually is called TDP-43. Like some other proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases, TDP-43 can form toxic aggregates that build up in or around neurons, causing damage. Although the buildup of TDP-43 is commonly found in people with &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS), its accumulation &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/case-suggests-tdp-43-protein-cause-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;has been found in Parkinson’s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, when cells are stressed, the certain proteins move into stress granules — temporary storage areas in the cell that form during stress. However, in aged neurons, these proteins didn’t move into the granules as expected. TDP-43 was also missing from these granules, which might explain why it tends to clump together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Aging is one of the primary risk factors for neurodegeneration, and our study demonstrates that aging alone mechanistically and functionally destabilizes RNA metabolism [chemical processes] in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old neurons may be already under constant stress, which interferes with their normal response to stress. This constant stress also affects other processes, such as ubiquitylation, which helps remove damaged proteins or other material no longer needed by cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confirm that their lab-grown aged neurons reflect real aging in the brain, the researchers studied brain tissue from people ages 30 to 50 and 80 to 90. In older brain tissue, RNA-related pathways — especially RNA-binding proteins — were reduced. This matched what they had seen in the aged neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In older brain tissue, TDP-43 was more often mislocated in the cytoplasm, just like in the aged neurons. Older brain tissue also showed signs of chronic (long-lasting) stress, suggesting aged neurons may accurately reflect key features of aging in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aging is one of the primary risk factors for neurodegeneration, and our study demonstrates that aging alone mechanistically and functionally destabilizes RNA metabolism [chemical processes] in neurons,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Officials say the exposure points were in Terminal 4, beyond security checkpoints and Concourses C and D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can linger in the air for up to two hours after the infectious person leaves, and the stated exposure window includes that time, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads by direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A person with measles can give the disease to other people even before they feel sick. Measles can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women and people with depressed immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who develop any symptoms of measles should self-isolate, stay away from others and seek medical care. Symptomatic individuals who do not have a healthcare provider may need to be seen at a local hospital emergency room or urgent care center. People with measles symptoms should first call their healthcare provider or the medical facility before going in. They will let you know when to visit their office so others in the waiting area are not exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/four-measles-cases-confirmed-in-navajo-county-first-in-arizona-this-year"&gt;Four cases of measles within Navajo County were reported by officials last week, marking the first cases in Arizona in 2025. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to a report in The Daily Mail, the airborne fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is nearly impossible to avoid and poses an especially grave risk to individuals with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-1" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect, deadlier to fight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus causes aspergillosis, a serious lung infection that can lead to organ failure and death, particularly in cancer, asthma, or HIV patients. As the news report notes, its spores are so small they are inhaled without notice. Once inside the lungs, the fungus can trigger chronic infections or even spread to the brain, heart, and kidneys in more invasive forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-2" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its danger, aspergillosis is not a reportable disease in the US — meaning infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities are not systematically tracked, making outbreaks difficult to identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising cases and soaring costs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing health data, the news outlet reported that invasive aspergillosis hospitalisations in the US rose by around 3% annually between 2000 and 2013. By 2014, nearly 15,000 hospital stays were linked to the infection, costing an estimated $1.2 billion. Intensive care autopsies also revealed it ranks among the top four infections most likely to cause death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 400,000 people are estimated to suffer from chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, the long-term form of the disease. Invasive cases, though less common, are far more fatal — with only 59% of organ transplant patients surviving a year after infection, and just 25% of stem cell transplant patients, according to studies cited by The Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heat, humidity, and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/market/market-stats/stocks-urban-enviro-waste-management-share-price-nse-bse-S0005472" data-vars-anchor-text="urban" data-vars-link-type="Auto" data-vars-page-type="story"&gt;urban&lt;/a&gt; risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus thrives in warm, damp environments and can survive temperatures above 120°F in compost piles. According to The Daily Mail, the highest exposure levels are being recorded in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, and California — states with hot, humid climates and extensive farming activity. Dense urban centers like New York, Houston, and Los Angeles are also vulnerable due to aging infrastructure and population density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Manchester study warned, the news report stated, that if fossil fuel use continues unchecked, Aspergillus fumigatus could expand by over 75% by 2100, putting millions more at risk across the southern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-7" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drug resistance from farm to human&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning is the rising drug resistance. Azole antifungal drugs — commonly used to treat human infections — are also widely applied in agriculture to protect crops. Experts cited by the news outlet said that this practice may be driving environmental resistance, with drug-resistant fungal spores jumping from soil to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-8" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in Applied and Environmental Microbiology found azole-resistant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus in farm soils across at least seven US states. Some strains are resistant to multiple standard treatments, and the mixing of fungal types may be accelerating the resistance crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO declares critical fungal threat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has named Aspergillus fumigatus a "critical priority" due to its high mortality rates and the increasing threat of untreatable infections. The news outlet reported that the WHO is urging global investment in new antifungal drugs, faster diagnostic tools, improved hospital protocols, and enhanced training for healthcare professionals.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary choices, such as consuming high-fiber or fatty foods, may lead to increased fermentation and gas production in the digestive tract. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle factors like stress or atypical sleep patterns can also play a role in gassiness. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consulting a healthcare provider about persistent or severe gassiness can help provide tailored treatment options. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Being gassy stinks (sometimes literally!). Sure, it's a totally normal part of being human (word is most people let one rip between 10 and 12 times a day).&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But if you're feeling the effects of excessive gas more often than not and it's getting uncomfortable, what's the best way to turn things around? "Intestinal gas is composed of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen from swallowed air, as well as methane and hydrogen from food being broken down by colonic bacteria," says &lt;a href="http://www.fdhs.com/physicians/marc-bernstein-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Marc Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fdhs.com/physician/marc-bernstein-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;, MD&lt;/a&gt;. "Poorly digested food, especially, causes excess fermentation in the colon and can lead to the development of gas bubbles."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052456/why-am-i-so-gassy-at-night/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Gassiness&lt;/a&gt; is usually not something to worry about, and can often be alleviated by nailing down the exact culprit and making adjustments accordingly (cruciferous veggies and carbonated drinks are common offenders). But if your gas is persistent or leads to severe symptoms like diarrhea, bloody stools or vomiting, you should see your doctor for a consult, says Bernstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are also several sneakier reasons why your insides might be feeling particularly balloon-like, many of which have nothing to do with your diet. Here, experts break down 11 reasons you may be so gassy, and exactly what to do about them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-your-sleep-pattern-is-messed-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Your sleep pattern is messed up.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Out-of-whack sleep patterns can cause dysbiosis, which is an imbalance of gut flora.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "When this happens, levels of methane and hydrogen can surge and lead to increased gas," says Bernstein. This gastrointestinal (GI) imbalance can lead to many other pesky &lt;a href="http://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/how-calm-anxious-stomach-brain-gut-connection" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;, such as cramps, nausea, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts recommend going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, including weekends, and doing your best to get at least seven hours of consistent, uninterrupted sleep each night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-youre-on-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. You're on medication.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some medications have unwanted side effects, such as gas. Pain-relievers in the NSAID family, for example, can disrupt the production of mucus in the GI tract and cause the stomach lining to become irritated and inflamed, says &lt;a href="https://mayafellernutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maya Feller, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cue excessive gas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other medications that affect the GI tract and cause gas in a similar fashion include cholesterol-lowering medications (statins), certain anti-depressants, antibiotics, laxatives and acid-suppressing medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you think your meds may be the cause of your gassiness, get in touch with your healthcare provier to find out if adjustments can be made-say, by finding another class of drugs that do the same job sans side effects, suggests Feller.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-you-talk-while-you-eat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. You talk while you eat.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swallowing air between bites of food may lead to excess gas. The pros call it aerophagia, which literally means excessive or repetitive air swallowing-the air enters the esophagus and accumulates in the stomach and small intestine, says &lt;a href="https://www.gidoctor.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Peyton Berookim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gidoctor.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, MD&lt;/a&gt;. Do your gut a solid by making sure you've chewed thoroughly and swallowed before adding to the dinner convo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-youre-super-stressed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. You're super stressed.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experiencing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292287/6-ways-stress-can-mess-with-your-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; can prevent your body from processing food efficiently, often passing it through your system too slowly. "This can cause bacteria in your body to build up, producing excess gas and bloating," says &lt;a href="http://www.eatwelltobewellrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cheryl Mussatto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://eatwelltobewellrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (The subsequent constipation can also make it harder to pass gas, says Bernstein. It's a one-two punch that, ironically, can lead to more stress). Excessive emotional stress can also increase the amount of hydrochloric acid in the intestinal tract and stomach, leading to gas buildup in the intestines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can reduce how often this happens by regularly practicing stress-busting techniques, such as deep breathing, exercise and yoga, says Mussatto. And since we also tend to eat more quickly when we're stressed, taking the time to enjoy your meals (and chew them thoroughly) can not only aid in digestion, but prevent you from swallowing excess air and feeling even gassier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-youve-amped-up-your-cardio"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. You've amped up your cardio.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cardio workouts increase heart rate and respiratory rate, which translates into breathing more frequently and heavily. "This can result in the consumption of air through the mouth, to the esophagus and into the stomach," says Berookim. Additionally, it can cause the physical jostling of the digestive organs, causing an uptick in gassiness and the need to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Waiting at least 30 to 60 minutes after eating to exercise may help prevent symptoms of gas and urgency while working out, says Berookim. Avoiding &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/in-depth/gas-and-gas-pains/art-20044739" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gas-inducing foods&lt;/a&gt; pre-workout, such as beans, lentils, cabbage and broccoli, can also be helpful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-youre-constipated"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. You're constipated.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Constipation is ultimately the top reason we experience more gas," says Bernstein. "When stool remains in the colon for too long, the digestive process becomes less active and bacteria has even more time for fermentation." As a result, you may feel uncomfortably bloated and gassy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289462/7-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-1200-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Increasing your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; by enjoying a diet full of fruits and veggies can help your digestive system retain water, bulk your stool and ease constipation, says Bernstein. Aim for 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day, making sure to increase your intake slowly (over the course of several weeks) to let your body get used to the extra fiber, says Mussatto. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-you-regularly-eat-high-fat-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. You regularly eat high-fat foods.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diet filled with high-fat foods (think: hot dogs, burgers, fries, bacon, chips) can leave you feeling bloated and gassy. "Because these foods reduce motility, bacteria can break down undigested food, resulting in increased hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane production in the colon," says Mussatto. Get things moving again by swapping out fattier foods with more fruits, veggies, nuts, whole grains, lean meats and fish. Drinking enough water and exercising regularly can also improve motility, Mussatto adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-you-constantly-drink-from-a-water-bottle"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8. You constantly drink from a water bottle.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These days, accessorizing with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/stanley-new-year-new-you-collection-launch-target-8762944" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reusable water bottle&lt;/a&gt; to stay hydrated (and help the environment) is pretty standard-but many of us don't so much drink out of them as we do chug (especially after a challenging workout). This usually means we're swallowing air in the process, says Feller, and any air we don't immediately burp out will eventually mosey out the other end. It's best to sip slowly and keep excess air swallowing to a minimum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-9-youve-got-an-infection"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 9. You've got an infection.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enteric pathogens (&lt;em&gt;E.coli, salmonella&lt;/em&gt;) can typically result in diarrhea, abdominal bloating and gassiness. "They do this by causing inflammation of the small intestine," says Berookim. "When the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) gets inflamed, it can cause delayed emptying of gastric contents, which can result in bloating."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reduce symptoms as you recover, make sure to drink plenty of clear liquids, stick to foods that are easy on the stomach (such as toast, soda crackers, rice or eggs), and avoid dairy products, as well as high-fat, high-fiber and spicy foods until you're feeling better. To prevent future infections, follow up your recovery with a diverse, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;, eat plenty of fiber and wash your hands when appropriate, says Bernstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-10-youve-changed-your-diet-recently"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 10. You've changed your diet recently.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you've recently decided to add more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt; to your diet (fruits, veggies, beans, whole grains), doing so too quickly can lead to the unpleasant side effect of excessive gas. "Complex carbs, especially beans, contain a type of carb called oligosaccharides, and the bacteria in your gut love this particular carb," says Mussatto. "When they munch on it, they produce nitrogen gas, which gets released as flatulence."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And since the fiber these foods contain isn't absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract but is instead fermented, gas builds up in the large intestine or colon. To prevent discomfort, start out by eating small portions of high-fiber foods to help your digestive tract get used to digesting them, and wait to increase your intake until your body adjusts, says Mussatto. (And don't forget to increase your water intake at the same time. Otherwise, constipation.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-11-you-have-sleep-apnea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 11. You have sleep apnea.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people with sleep apnea breathe through their mouth at night. "Mouth breathing causes the body to swallow more air and can lead to feeling bloated," says Bernstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Using a CPAP machine to help you breathe properly through the mouth can also cause the stomach to fill with air and increase gassiness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If the CPAP pressure is too high, the extra air has nowhere else to go—thus, it's directed into the esophagus and into the belly," explains Berookim. "If the pressure's too low and inadequate to resolve the apnea event, you may gulp air in quickly, which is then forced into the esophagus instead."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The machine has to be finely tuned to the individual to maximize effectiveness. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think this might be why you're extra gassy—you may need to either adjust your CPAP machine or try a different approach to treat your sleep woes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing gassiness can sometimes feel like a daunting task, but understanding the root causes and making thoughtful adjustments to your daily habits can make all the difference. Whether it’s tweaking your diet, moderating stress levels or reevaluating your sleep patterns and medication, small changes can lead to big improvements in how your gut feels. Remember, the occasional “toot” is perfectly normal. Listen to your body, take note of what might be triggering the extra gas, and take steps to address it at your own pace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if persistent gassiness or uncomfortable symptoms persist despite your efforts, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional. Issues like chronic bloating, diarrhea or severe discomfort can sometimes signify more serious conditions that require medical attention. At the end of the day, trust your gut, literally! With a bit of mindful effort, you’ll be back to feeling comfortable and confident in no time.&lt;br&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;In a major scientific breakthrough, researchers have discovered hundreds of previously unknown giant viruses in oceans around the world. Led by marine biologist Benjamin Minch and virologist Mohammad Moniruzzaman from the University of Miami, the team used advanced computer software to analyze seawater samples and identify microbial genomes. Among their findings were 230 giant viruses never before documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries are significant because they help scientists better understand ocean ecosystems, especially the role of viruses in the lives of microscopic marine organisms called protists. These include algae, amoeba, and flagellates, which are essential to the ocean's food chain and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, titled &lt;em&gt;"Expansion of the Genomic and Functional Diversity of Global Ocean Giant Viruses,"&lt;/em&gt; was published on April 21, 2025, in the&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.miami.edu/rosenstiel/stories/2025/06/scientists-discover-230-new-giant-viruses-that-shape-ocean-life-and-health.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt; journal Nature npj Viruses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It reports the discovery of numerous previously unknown giant virus genomes, significantly expanding the existing scientific understanding of viral diversity in the world's oceans. Within these genomes, 530 new functional proteins were characterized, including nine proteins involved in photosynthesis. This indicates that these viruses may be able to manipulate their host and the photosynthesis process during infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By better understanding the diversity and role of giant viruses in the ocean and how they interact with algae and other ocean microbes, we can predict and possibly manage harmful algal blooms, which are human health hazards in Florida as well as all over the world," said &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/cf5b6785ab0cf731420b63067fbfad25"&gt;Mohammad Moniruzzaman,&lt;/a&gt; a co-author of the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Marine Biology and Ecology.  "Giant viruses are often the main cause of death for many phytoplankton, which serve as the base of the food web supporting ocean ecosystems and food sources. The novel functions found in giant viruses could have biotechnological potential, as some of these functions might represent novel enzymes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, giant viruses were largely undetected by scientific methods due to limitations in bioinformatic pipelines. The researchers created an innovative tool called BEREN (Bioinformatic tool for Eukaryotic virus Recovery from Environmental metageNomes), designed to identify giant virus genomes within extensive public DNA sequencing datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered that giant viruses possess genes involved in cellular functions such as carbon metabolism and photosynthesis-traditionally found only in cellular organisms, said Benjamin Minch, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://marine-biology-ecology.earth.miami.edu/index.html"&gt;Department of Marine Biology and Ecology at the Rosenstiel School.&lt;/a&gt; "This suggests that giant viruses play an outsized role in manipulating their host's metabolism during infection and influencing marine biogeochemistry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors used the University of Miami's Pegasus supercomputer at the Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC) to process and assemble large metagenomes-often exceeding a gigabase per library-enabling the reconstruction of hundreds of microbial community libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study allowed us to create a framework to improve existing tools for detecting novel viruses that could aid in our ability to monitor pollution and pathogens in our waterways." Minch added.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new study has uncovered how everyday financial behaviors—captured in routine banking data—can signal early signs of cognitive decline and financial vulnerability in older adults, up to a decade before formal intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835294" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, was overseen by Professor John Gathergood from the University of Nottingham's School of Economics and David Leake at Lloyds Banking Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed anonymized banking records from over 66,000 individuals. It compared 16,742 individuals who were registered for power of attorney (PoA) due to a loss of financial capacity with a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt; of 50,226 matched individuals without reported capacity loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results reveal that subtle but significant changes in financial behavior—such as reduced spending on travel and hobbies, increased household bills, fewer online banking logins, and more frequent requests to reset PINs—begin to appear several years before individuals are formally identified as lacking financial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These patterns provide the first large-scale evidence that behavioral data held by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/financial+institutions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;financial institutions&lt;/a&gt; can reveal the early emergence of cognitive decline," said Professor John Gathergood, of the University of Nottingham School of Economics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added, "It is a powerful demonstration of how anonymized banking data can be used responsibly to protect the most vulnerable members of society."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key findings show that individuals with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9.6 percentage points less likely to spend on travel five years before PoA registration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.9 points less likely to spend on hobbies like gardening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.0 fewer online &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/banking/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;banking&lt;/a&gt; logins per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More likely to report fraud, lose cards, and request PIN resets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The research suggests that early-stage Alzheimer's disease and related dementias may lead to decreased engagement in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/self-care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;self-care&lt;/a&gt; and out-of-home activities, replaced by increased home-based spending. Importantly, the decline in financial activity also included signs of financial errors and vulnerability to fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study calls for further research into integrating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/financial+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;financial data&lt;/a&gt; with health and social care pathways—always with strict data privacy safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also carry implications for public awareness of PoA registration, which remains relatively low in the UK despite growing concerns about dementia-related financial harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Gathergood added, "As a society, we need to better support people at risk of losing financial capacity—long before the signs become obvious to friends or family. Early detection through financial behavior may be a key part of that solution. By better understanding behavioral markers of declining capacity, banks can explore how to strengthen safeguards for customers."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As measles cases near record levels in isolated areas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measles-camp-checklist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;urging summer camps&lt;/a&gt; to check for documentation of immunity through vaccination or prior infection for all children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there has been increased concerns about potential for additional outbreaks and spread, especially in the setting of waning or lowering rates of immunizations,” said Dr. Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious diseases physician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Children’s National Hospital. “Nine out of every 10 folks who are unimmunized will get measles when exposed to someone who is actively ill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measles-camp-checklist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a release, &lt;/a&gt;the CDC said measles can spread quickly because campers and staff spend a lot of time in close proximity to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In sleepaway camps, you have lots of children in very close contact, pretty much constantly,” Yonts said. “You likely have kids on buses together, spending lots of time face to face. And for something like measles, that is extremely contagious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC encouraged camps to maintain documentation of measles immunity status for all campers, staff and volunteers, including anyone with medical or other exemptions from vaccination. This information would help the health department identify people who are not immune to measles, so that they can be offered post-exposure prophylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which children are at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonts said a child who has received the recommended two doses of the measles vaccine, and is otherwise healthy, with no immunocompromising conditions or treatments, is “considered protected and there’s really nothing else to do, other than watch those children and have them stay home if they do develop fever and a rash,” or other measles symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for a child who hasn’t been vaccinated, “they are at much higher risk of getting sick, they need to have a higher level of suspicion, and may qualify for treatments such as immunoglobulin, in the case of exposure,” Yonts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s recommendations include communicating state, local and/or camp vaccine requirements to campers, parents and staff before the camp session begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Immunity is something that’s required in schools during the year, so, frankly, it just makes sense that summer camps should also want the same level of protection,” Yonts said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A private equity firm has stepped in to finance a biological research lab at Harvard University, administrators said Monday, while also launching a biotech alongside it that will develop new therapies for metabolic conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/17/trump-terminate-research-grants-harvard-university-medical-school-cancer-disease-als/"&gt;Harvard grapples with severe financing cuts&lt;/a&gt; undertaken by the Trump administration, some university officials believe the unusual arrangement could be at least one model to fund other academic research in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the deal announced Monday, İş Private Equity, a Turkish firm, has committed $39 million to a laboratory run by Gökhan Hotamışlıgil, a professor of genetics and metabolism at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The firm, which is a branch of Turkey’s İşbank Group, also plans to invest an undisclosed amount of money in any drug candidates that come out of Hotamışlıgil’s laboratory and are moved into a new biotech called Enlila. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a relatively modest deal, in the scope of investment banking. But the collaboration provides much-needed capital at a time when the model for funding scientific research has been thrown into chaos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="botr_9ummWnjU_0mMTwWMa_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA astronaut Frank Rubio learned the hard way the odd effects a year in space has on the human body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rubio spent over a year in space, and he actually set a record in the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he came back, he talked about the long list of side effects you have to take into account as a NASA astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And what he had to say about it was interesting, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCOVER SBX CARS: &lt;a href="https://sbxcars.com/?utm_source=supercarblondie.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA astronaut Frank Rubio &lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/frank-rubio-space-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;accidentally set a new record for the longest time spent in space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He didn’t do it on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His mission was supposed to last around six months, but there was a coolant leak in the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft he was in, which means he ended up spending 371 days in &lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/tech/space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon his return, in September 2023, he found out the hard way what a year in space does to your body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio.jpg" data-lightbox="131399" data-title="NASA"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-id="60769" src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1024x544.jpg" alt="NASA astronaut Frank Rubio year in space" class="wp-image-60769" srcset="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-500x266.jpg 500w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-768x408.jpg 768w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1536x816.jpg 1536w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2048x1088.jpg 2048w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1080x574.jpg 1080w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1280x680.jpg 1280w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-980x521.jpg 980w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-480x255.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, we’d say he finally ‘set foot’ on Earth after a year, but on this occasion, this would be inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is because after living in microgravity for over a year, Rubio needed time to relearn how to walk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/astronaut-who-set-record-for-longest-time-in-space-shares-the-hardest-part-of-adjusting-back-to-life-on-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;first and perhaps most disconcerting consequence&lt;/a&gt; of a year in space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It must feel scary to realize you can’t walk anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the good news is this is just temporary, and astronauts are perfectly capable of walking again within a few weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-scaled.jpeg" data-lightbox="131399" data-title="NASA"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" data-id="60770" src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Frank Rubio" class="wp-image-60770" srcset="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1080x720.jpeg 1080w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-1280x853.jpeg 1280w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-980x653.jpeg 980w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-480x320.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The absence of Earth’s gravity also causes a decrease in muscle mass and bone density.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/20/health/your-body-in-space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title=""&gt;Dr. Jennifer Fogarty&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor from Baylor College who works with NASA, said the biggest changes in bone and muscle loss occur in the first couple of months of a mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the first few months, the body adjusts to the new conditions, and things get better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How do you coordinate movement like walking, which you haven’t done for a long period of time, and then the idea of balance? When you put those two together, it can create a precarious situation,” Dr. Fogarty said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, she explained how your blood flow changes when living in weightless microgravity, which can cause eye swelling or blurry vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2.jpg" data-lightbox="131399" data-title="NASA"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" data-id="60775" src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-1024x538.jpg" alt="Frank Rubio" class="wp-image-60775" srcset="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-500x263.jpg 500w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-768x404.jpg 768w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-2048x1076.jpg 2048w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-1080x567.jpg 1080w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-1280x673.jpg 1280w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-980x515.jpg 980w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Frank-Rubio-2-480x252.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical changes, which are generally temporary, astronauts also have to deal with psychological effects that come from being isolated for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, the biggest issue is sensory deprivation, which can cause anxiety and sleep loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fogarty essentially said that the best possible cure is prevention, as astronauts need to prepare for everything, from &lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/astronauts-struggling-to-walk-on-moon-rare-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the simple act of walking&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://supercarblondie.com/how-astronauts-sleep-iss-under-zero-gravity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learning how to sleep in space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in, the best thing NASA can do is make sure astronauts are well-trained and prepared because, if they are, it’ll be a lot easier to deal with these unpleasant, albeit temporary, side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study of nearly 400,000 home care recipients found that lonely older adults had an 18-23% lower risk of dying within a year compared to non-lonely peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The findings contradict previous research on the general population, where loneliness typically predicts earlier death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers suggest loneliness may be a consequence of declining health rather than a cause, and home care services may provide protective social contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATERLOO, Ontario —&lt;/strong&gt; Common wisdom tells us that loneliness kills. Health officials have compared social isolation to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and countless studies have linked feeling lonely to earlier death. But a surprising new study involving nearly 400,000 older adults across three countries has turned this assumption upside down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracking home care recipients in Canada, Finland, and New Zealand discovered something unexpected: lonely &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; were actually &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to die within a year compared to their non-lonely peers. Among the most vulnerable &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seniors&lt;/a&gt; — those receiving help at home with daily activities — being lonely was associated with an 18% to 23% lower risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-finding-matters-more-than-you-think"&gt;Why This Finding Matters More Than You Think&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bonaventure Egbujie and his research team at the University of Waterloo weren’t expecting to overturn conventional wisdom when they began analyzing mortality data from home care recipients. Previous studies had consistently shown that lonely people &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/social-isolation-loneliness-heart-attack-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tend to die younger,&lt;/a&gt; leading to widespread public health campaigns warning about the dangers of social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Home care recipients represent a particularly vulnerable group: older adults who need assistance with daily activities like bathing, dressing, or managing medications, but still live in their own homes rather than nursing facilities. About 15% of people aged 75 and older in Finland receive home care, while 6% of Canadian households and 7.5% of New Zealanders over 65 use these services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among this population, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; was surprisingly common. Between 16% and 24% of home care recipients reported feeling lonely, with New Zealand showing the highest rates and Canada the lowest. Women were more likely to report loneliness than men, and rates increased with age across all three countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists tracked 383,386 older adults for one year to see who died and when, linking assessment data to official death records in each country. They carefully controlled for dozens of factors known to influence mortality risk, including age, gender, living arrangements, health conditions like cancer and heart failure, cognitive function, physical abilities, and pain levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-numbers-don-t-lie"&gt;The Numbers Don’t Lie&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After accounting for all these health and social factors, researchers found consistently lower death rates among lonely participants across all three countries. In Canada, lonely home care recipients had an 18% lower risk of dying within a year. Finnish lonely participants showed a 15% reduction in death risk, while those in New Zealand had a 23% lower &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mortality risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more intriguingly, the survival advantage remained consistent when researchers looked at men and women separately. Graphs showing the probability of staying alive over time revealed that lonely participants consistently outlived their non-lonely counterparts throughout the entire year of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152586102500204X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, directly contradict what researchers expected based on studies of the general population, where loneliness typically predicts &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/early-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;earlier death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-loneliness-health-assumptions-upside-down"&gt;Turning Loneliness Health Assumptions Upside Down&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than loneliness &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/loneliness-epidemic-myth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;causing poor health&lt;/a&gt;, declining health might lead to loneliness. As people develop serious illnesses, they may withdraw from social activities or lose friends, creating isolation. In this scenario, the sickest individuals (who are most likely to die) would be less likely to report feeling lonely simply because they’re too ill to recognize or articulate their social needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found evidence supporting this theory. Lonely participants actually had better baseline physical functioning and were less impaired in daily activities compared to non-lonely participants. However, they also scored worse on measures of clinical instability and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/older-people-lonely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, revealing a complex mix of preserved abilities and emerging problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another explanation focuses on healthcare-seeking behavior. Previous research has shown that lonely people tend to use medical services more frequently. Among home care recipients, this could translate into earlier detection of health problems and more intensive monitoring, potentially preventing deaths that might otherwise occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Home care services themselves might function as a form of social intervention. Regular visits from nurses, therapists, and care coordinators provide not just medical support but also human connection for isolated older adults. Professional contact could partially offset the health risks typically associated with loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-impact-for-families-and-caregivers"&gt;Real-World Impact for Families and Caregivers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings don’t diminish the importance of addressing loneliness among older adults. Researchers emphasize that feeling lonely remains &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a serious quality-of-life issue&lt;/a&gt; that deserves attention regardless of its relationship to mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the results do challenge blanket assumptions about loneliness and death. For the most vulnerable older adults, the traditional relationship between social isolation and mortality appears to break down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is a serious threat to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/trust-happiness-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological well-being&lt;/a&gt;. The mental health consequences of loneliness make it an important priority for public health, even if loneliness doesn’t kill you,” said the study’s senior author, Dr. John Hirdes, a professor in Waterloo’s School of Public Health Science, in a statement. “Home and community care services must play a protective role by supporting social contact for isolated people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than assuming all lonely older adults face immediate health risks, care teams might focus on the quality-of-life aspects of social isolation while recognizing that some of their loneliest clients may actually be more resilient than expected. Healthcare providers and policymakers could develop more targeted interventions that address emotional wellbeing without creating unnecessary alarm about mortality risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a survival analysis using standardized assessment data from home care recipients in Canada (178,611 participants), Finland (35,073), and New Zealand (85,065) between 2010-2020. All participants were 65 or older, lived in private homes, had no terminal diagnosis, and showed adequate cognitive function for reliable self-reporting. Professional health workers assessed loneliness using the interRAI Home Care assessment tool, asking whether clients “say or indicate they feel lonely.” Participants were followed for one year to track mortality, with death records linked through official government databases. Researchers used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate mortality risk while controlling for age, gender, marital status, living arrangements, cognitive function, physical abilities, pain levels, and major health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across all three countries, lonely home care recipients showed significantly lower one-year mortality rates after adjusting for health and demographic factors. Hazard ratios were 0.82 (18% lower risk) in Canada, 0.85 (15% lower risk) in Finland, and 0.77 (23% lower risk) in New Zealand. Loneliness prevalence ranged from 15.9% in Canada to 24.4% in New Zealand. Lonely participants showed better physical functioning but worse clinical instability scores compared to non-lonely peers. The survival advantage remained consistent across both men and women and persisted throughout the entire follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study followed participants for only one year, potentially missing longer-term effects of loneliness on mortality. Researchers used a single-item measure of loneliness rather than more comprehensive multi-dimensional scales. The study design couldn’t establish whether loneliness preceded health changes or vice versa, making it difficult to determine causal relationships. The findings may not generalize to older adults not receiving home care services or to different cultural contexts beyond the three countries studied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research received no funding from public, commercial, or not-for-profit agencies. All authors declared no conflicts of interest. The study used existing administrative data with appropriate ethical approval from each country’s research ethics boards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-information"&gt;Publication Information&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study “Cross-National Evidence on Risk of Death Associated with Loneliness: A Survival Analysis of 1-Year All-Cause Mortality among Older Adult Home Care Recipients in Canada, Finland, and Aotearoa New Zealand” was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152586102500204X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/a&gt; (JAMDA), Volume 26, 2025, article number 105687, by lead author Bonaventure A.

&lt;p&gt;Family estrangement can leave wounds that never fully heal, even with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a mother who caused lasting harm suddenly returns with a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1knf2e7/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_estranged_mother/"&gt;life-or-death request&lt;/a&gt;, it forces painful choices for a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITAH for not wanting to give my estranged mother my kidney?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (30 F) have a mother (62 F) who is estranged from me and has been for about 5 years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made me and my partner homeless 5 years ago, and I don’t speak to her or any of my other family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon, the mother was back — and she had a big request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she texts me on FB and tells me that she has kidney disease. She sends me the information to get tested to see if I’m a match and asks me if I can donate a kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She can’t quite understand why her mother chose to ask her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind I have 5 other siblings she’s not estranged from that she can ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s immediately hesitant for multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have health problems myself, and I don’t think I could deal with major surgery like a kidney transplant anyway due to my health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wonders if she can really turn her mother down over something this big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I tell her no, and should I feel guilty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AITAH for not wanting to give her my kidney?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lifetime of pain doesn’t just disappear — especially without an apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Reddit make of this difficult situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mother’s request is unreasonable for multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

They cause night-time headaches because, depending on where the tumour is located, lying down puts more pressure on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although generally slow-growing and not normally cancerous (so it won’t spread elsewhere in the body), without treatment to cut it out a meningioma can squash the brain to the extent it causes vision loss, personality changes, memory loss and even permanent paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Claire Love woke up with headaches almost every night for six months before she was diagnosed with meningioma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What’s more, although survival rates are relatively high (70 per cent of patients are alive after ten years), between 10 and 20 per cent die within five years, as the tumours can trigger a catastrophic bleed in the brain, or a build-up of pressure that damages it beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in rare cases, a meningioma can become cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember swearing out loud when the consultant said the word “tumour”,’ says Claire. ‘I’d gone to the appointment for the scan results on my own as I was so certain nothing was seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was only 35. The doctor said it was highly unusual for someone my age to have this condition.’ (Most people with meningiomas are in their 60s – the risk increases with age.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No explanation was offered after her diagnosis in 2019. However, six years on, Claire believes she knows what may have caused it in her case – the contraceptive jab, which she took for over a decade before starting her family in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, a paper published in the BMJ reported that women who used the same popular type of contraceptive jab Claire was on – called Depo-Provera – for more than a year were five times more likely to develop a meningioma than women who don’t use it. Claire read about the link through an online support group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jab, also known as medroxyprogesterone acetate (a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone), is given into the arm or buttocks by a doctor every three months and works by preventing eggs from being released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s been available on the NHS for more than 40 years – in England alone GPs issue roughly 10,000 prescriptions a month for it. The main advantage is it means women don’t have to remember to take a contraceptive pill at the same time every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BMJ study, by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, analysed data on more than 18,000 women in France who underwent surgery for meningioma between 2009 and 2018. The numbers developing meningioma while using the jab were significantly higher than in women not on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Normally, out of every 1,000 women aged 30, you would expect to see four cases of meningioma by the time they reach 80,’ says Dr Simon Newman, chief scientific officer at the Brain Tumour Charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘With Depo-Provera, that increases to 20 cases per 1,000 women – so even though it’s still small, the risk is greater.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the study came out, the UK drug safety watchdog – the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – called on the jab’s manufacturer, Pfizer, to include a warning about the risk in patient information leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer also wrote to NHS doctors last autumn urging them to immediately stop women from using Depo-Provera if they were diagnosed with a meningioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exactly how and why it triggers tumour growth is not clear, but it’s thought to be due to exposure to synthetic forms of progesterone (progestogens) – around 70 per cent of meningioma cells have progesterone receptors on them, which means the synthetic hormones may be more likely to bind to them and make them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scans showing a normal brain, left, and a meningioma tumour. Between 10 and 20 per cent of meningioma patients die within five years, as the tumours can trigger a catastrophic bleed in the brain, or a build-up of pressure that damages it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More recent work by the same French researchers also found a heightened risk with some – but not all – types of oral contraceptives that contain progestogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their data, published in the BMJ last week, found women who took forms of the Pill made with levonorgestrel (a type of progestogen) for five years or more were 50 per cent more at risk of meningioma, though the numbers affected are still small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, although it’s not clear how many women in the UK may have developed a tumour after using the jab, Claire’s case is far from an isolated one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, the Mail reported that lawyers in the US are pursuing a class action against Pfizer on behalf of 400 women who blame the injection for their tumours – and since that news broke, dozens of British women responded with their own stories, fearing the same has happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One said: ‘I’ve been on this for eight years and was never informed of the risk. I’ve had terrible headaches for months and just found out I have three meningioma tumours.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another woman from London, who had a golf-ball sized growth removed from her brain, said: ‘If I knew the risks I would never have taken this. I don’t blame the NHS – it’s the companies that make them that don’t give accurate information. If we are told these are possible side-effects then we have a choice to take it or not – but we never had that option.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One law firm, which asked not to be identified, said at least 200 women in the UK had been in touch over the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separately, Chaya Hanoomanjee, managing director at London law firm Austen Hays – which specialises in class actions – said it is also investigating the grounds for a possible UK case against Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’re trying to identify people who have been impacted,’ she told Good Health. ‘The big question is whether the manufacturer was aware of the risks before the BMJ paper in March 2024, but failed to alert women who were on the jab.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Depo-Provera contraceptive jab has been available on the NHS for more than 40 years – in England alone GPs issue roughly 10,000 prescriptions a month for it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer UK declined to comment to Good Health on whether it knew about the increased risk of meningioma before the BMJ paper was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Newman says there is other evidence that meningioma growth can be fuelled by natural hormonal fluctuations – particularly spikes in progesterone seen when a woman is expecting a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Pregnancy does appear to increase the rate of growth of meningioma cells,’ he says. ‘And that means women do seem to be twice as likely to get it as men.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Claire’s diagnosis was only the beginning of her ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days she was undergoing a 15-hour operation, during which surgeons removed her entire forehead to access the tumour. Afterwards, she developed an abscess inside her skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My head filled with pus inside the wound and started to swell from the inside out,’ she recalls. ‘I had to have more surgery to wash the wound out.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the infection was destroying the bone in her skull. To give it a better chance of clearing by letting more air circulate in the cavity, Claire lived for ten months with no forehead bone – just a layer of skin covering where it should be. Nurses visited her at home daily to inject antibiotics to clear up the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I looked like an alien,’ she recalls. ‘I had to wear a special helmet if I left the house, to protect against any damage.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third operation followed to replace her forehead with a permanent metal plate. But even that wasn’t the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Two years later, in 2021, I had a seizure in my sleep,’ she says. ‘I was rushed to hospital, where doctors put me into an induced coma for three days as the seizures would not stop.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was subsequently diagnosed with epilepsy – a direct result of the tumour’s damage to the brain – and will be on anti-seizure medication for life. She is also having counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Claire says she is undecided about pursuing legal action, as she ‘can’t say for certain that Depo-Provera caused my meningioma’. Her focus is instead on alerting other women to the dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The tumour has ruined my life - I’m a shadow of my former self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’m due another scan in December and I’m already starting to have anxiety about whether the tumour could have returned. I’m only young, but I’m worried about my future and my children all the time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 15:57:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQSXpjelktai1Dd0gydUpjM04yUWJGejEySkZFcURJSmFTbVd4Z1lWMDhZREVQVzQxY2lMYUxMRnRGNFRVa2dwS21Lem5Oa1U3ZHVLUEQ0VkRYREVoeWxMdHYtYXE0SU5UWUtCTjFhalJvdUtEVXVod0hqSXhTZmFXYlRzTF91NEZRbjdIMjRKRGxXN1pMcE9Gb09ucHNTUjQxVFRNZVRoTHVhd1JNUXVKY2NmQWExdTQ</guid></item><item><title>一名感染麻疹的旅行者飞往迈阿密。下一步是什么？ -《迈阿密先驱报》 | A traveler infected with measles flew into Miami.

        A person infected with measles flew from Boston to Miami in June 2025 on a JetBlue flight, health officials say.

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami has detected another case of measles, one of the most contagious diseases in the world, as the country nears record levels of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials have confirmed that a person infected with measles arrived in Miami earlier in June from Boston. The traveler flew into Miami International Airport on JetBlue flight 639, according to the Boston Public Health Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight, which departed from Boston Logan International Airport at 9:12 p.m. June 8, arrived in Miami at 1:14 a.m. June 9, flight tracking website data shows. Boston health officials said they’re working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify and notify passengers who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread through coughing, sneezing and by touching infected surfaces. It produces a rash over the skin and flu-like symptoms. While most people can recover at home, the disease can lead to serious and sometimes deadly complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 following an effective vaccination program, with the country seeing sporadic travel-related cases. It’s rare for people who are vaccinated against the disease to get sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But measles has made a comeback as child vaccination rates continue to decline in the country and the disease is circulating more globally, with the U.S. this year recording its first measles deaths in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case of measles highlights the importance of obtaining the MMR vaccine to protect ourselves and our community. The MMR vaccine is highly effective at preventing measles infection and also protects against mumps and rubella,” Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Commissioner of Public Health for the City of Boston, said in a statement.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the country has recorded 1,197 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; this year, just shy of the 2019 record of 1,274, with nearly all of the cases involving people who are unvaccinated, according to CDC data. The U.S. has recorded three measles deaths in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-infographic"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this latest confirmed measles case, the person visited several places in Boston, including a hotel and a museum, while infectious from June 7 through June 8 before getting on a flight to Miami, according to the measles alert. The notice doesn’t state whether the person was vaccinated or unvaccinated, where the person was infected, or if the individual lives in Florida or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston Public Health Commission spokesperson Andrew Lemos confirmed to the Miami Herald that the infected traveler doesn’t live in Massachusetts and redirected all other questions to Florida’s health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="10" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabel Kilman, press secretary for the Florida Department of Health, declined to answer questions from the Miami Herald, including whether the person lives in South Florida or if they took any additional flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Florida Department of Health does not comment on any ongoing or active epidemiological investigations,” Kilman said in an email on Monday. “The Department remains committed to ensuring the safety and health of Florida’s residents and visitors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Miami International Airport spokesperson Greg Chin said airport officials weren’t notified about the case and learned about the infected traveler when the Miami Herald requested comment. He redirected questions to the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which operates a “Port Health Station” at MIA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The station, one of 20 located in the country, is staffed with CDC medical, veterinary and public health officers who &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/port-health/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;assess ill travelers for infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; and decide what measures should be taken in response as part of the country’s strategy to reduce the introduction and spread of contagious diseases, according to the CDC’s website. The Herald hasn’t been able to confirm if the traveler was seen at the MIA CDC station&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JetBlue has not responded to the Miami Herald’s request for comment on what precuations or measures the airline has taken to reduce the disease spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be transmitted four days before the start of symptoms, according to the Florida health department. Symptoms can appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus, and are at first similar to a normal cold and can include cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes and a high fever up to 105 degrees. The rash typically appears three five days after the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="16" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many measles cases has Florida recorded?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Florida has recorded at least three confirmed measles cases this year, according to preliminary data from the state’s infectious disease surveillance system, which goes up to June 7 and is the most available data, as of Monday, June 16. The most recently reported case, recorded in June, involved a person between the ages of 25 and 29 who lives in Leon County, part of the state’s Panhandle. The person was infected in the U.S., but not in Florida, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s preliminary data is based on when the case was reported to the state, with cases assigned based on the county where the person lives, regardless of where the person got sick, hospitalized, diagnosed or exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Miami Herald hasn’t been able to confirm if the June Leon County measles case is different from the Boston to Miami traveler case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="20" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida’s other two confirmed measles cases this year were recorded in South Florida. One involved a &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article301467059.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Miami-Dade teen&lt;/a&gt;, the other was a &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article307112636.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;child under 5 in Broward County&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the state recorded at least a dozen cases of the rash-causing disease, some of which were linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article286452210.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;outbreak at a Broward elementary school.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What else to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR, which helps protect against measles infection, is considered to be highly effective in reducing infection and is one of the shots required to attend K-12 school in the U.S., though some students may have a religious or medical exemption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several health experts the Miami Herald has previously spoken to have attributed the country’s growing measles outbreak, in part, to fewer parents vaccinating their kids after COVID as politics, misinformation and personal freedom have muddied vaccination guidance and reduced trust in what the family doctor recommends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-110" class="zone zone-el" index="24" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article301578984.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORE: Why fewer kids are getting vaccinated in Florida — and how that could affect outbreaks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says the MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners in the U.S. “ is now below the 95% coverage target—much lower in some communities — and is decreasing.” Florida, for example, has seen a decline in overall mandatory school vaccinations for measles and other infectious diseases among kindergartners in recent years, as the Herald has previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said it has also noticed an increase in “measles activity” globally in recent years, “meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-111" class="zone zone-el" index="27" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because measles is highly contagious, it can “easily spread in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated communities,” according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that the best way to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;protect against measles&lt;/a&gt; is to get the MMR vaccine or the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, which also protects against chickenpox. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about the vaccine or are &lt;a href="Did%20you%20get%20the%20measles%20vaccine%20in%20the%20past?%20Do%20you%20need%20another%20shot?%20How%20to%20checkRead%20more%20at:%20https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article302085069.html#storylink=cpy" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;unsure if you were vaccinated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who believe — or were notified — that they were exposed to someone with measles should call their doctor for guidance. Don’t show up to the doctor’s office unannounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-112" class="zone zone-el" index="30" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;June 16, 2025 at 11:54 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

Recent findings suggest there may be more going on than just a morning jolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have been discussing how this popular beverage is linked with lower chances of certain diseases. A 2025 meta-analysis found that individuals with diabetes who consumed one to four cups a day lowered their risk of heart-related issues and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faculty.smhs.gwu.edu/leana-sheryle-wen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Leana Wen&lt;/a&gt;, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at &lt;a href="https://www.gwu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt;, says coffee’s place in a balanced routine is worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence is quite strong,” said Dr. Wen, who has seen interest grow around simple lifestyle tweaks that might benefit both the heart and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-this-amount-of-water-per-day-helps-control-blood-sugar-levels-in-people-with-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coffee-s-protective-side"&gt;Coffee’s protective side&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have observed that those who regularly drink moderate amounts could experience lower overall mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same review linked coffee with lessened odds of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists point to antioxidant components in &lt;em&gt;coffea arabica&lt;/em&gt; that may play a role in shielding cells from stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-flavor-can-be-improved-with-a-simple-trick/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; varieties contain substances that might help the body manage cholesterol. These natural agents may also support insulin activity, which is a factor in maintaining healthy glucose levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with sensible meal choices, a few cups could support broader metabolic balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-coffee-moderation-is-key"&gt;Why coffee moderation is key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A safe &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much"&gt;limit&lt;/a&gt; for most healthy adults is around 400 milligrams of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-has-a-protective-effect-on-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caffeine per day&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly four 8-ounce cups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone goes beyond that, issues such as sleeplessness or jitteriness can appear. Tracking how much caffeine is in each cup keeps things under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with heart conditions may want to watch for symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-palpitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;palpitations&lt;/a&gt; if they consume several cups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others might find that too much caffeine upsets digestion or nerves. A balanced approach helps keep potential downsides in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-coffee-interacts-with-the-body"&gt;How coffee interacts with the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine stimulates the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542179/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, which can temporarily boost alertness and focus. It blocks the effects of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep, helping people feel more awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee also triggers the release of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamine-changes-from-cannabis-last-at-least-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt; and norepinephrine, chemicals tied to mood and energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these effects are often seen as positive, they can lead to restlessness or irritability in sensitive individuals, especially if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caffeine-affects-blood-sugar-and-insulin"&gt;Caffeine affects blood sugar and insulin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate coffee intake has been linked with improved &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the body move glucose from the blood into cells more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect may reduce the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21501-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and help those with the condition manage blood sugar better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine can also affect &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6544578/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glucose metabolism&lt;/a&gt; differently in each person. In some, it may slightly raise blood sugar for a short time. The impact seems to depend on genetics, caffeine tolerance, and what’s eaten with or after the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-benefits"&gt;Who benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most adults can enjoy a moderate coffee habit. &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2010/08/moderate-caffeine-consumption-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, need to limit daily caffeine intake to under 200 milligrams to reduce potential concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important for parents to remember that the &lt;a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; suggests children under 12 avoid caffeine entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with type 2 diabetes appear to gain some pluses from moderate coffee consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a large survey, those reporting a few cups daily had lower rates of complications compared to non-drinkers. If someone experiences anxiety or insomnia, it’s wise to reassess caffeine’s part in the overall diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tea-s-place"&gt;Tea’s place&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea shares similarities with coffee, offering bioactive compounds that may support cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/camellia-sinensis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaves have polyphenols, which can help lower inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These may be especially relevant for individuals watching their blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt; tends to have lower caffeine levels than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-every-day-proven-studies-to-delay-biological-aging-in-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;black tea&lt;/a&gt;. Unsweetened versions sidestep extra calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that individuals with diabetes who drank up to two cups a day saw favorable trends related to heart disease and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-energy-drinks-and-sodas"&gt;What about energy drinks and sodas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all caffeinated beverages are equal. While coffee and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-every-day-proven-studies-to-delay-biological-aging-in-humans/"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; may offer potential health benefits, energy drinks and many sodas come with risks that often outweigh any positive effects of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks can contain up to 300 milligrams of caffeine per can, along with large amounts of added sugars and artificial additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4682602/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; with increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and in some cases, hospitalization. For people with diabetes, the sugar content alone makes these drinks problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-staying-mindful"&gt;Staying mindful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many coffee and tea beverages come packed with sugar, syrups, or whipped toppings. These extras can increase calorie load and may undo the potential protective aspects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An approach that keeps sugar minimal might allow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-coffee-may-help-women-stay-sharp-and-strong-as-they-age/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; or tea to retain their possible health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People sensitive to caffeine might try decaffeinated options. These still contain various phytochemicals that could help the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measured intake can be tailored to individual needs, particularly when combined with professional medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1570644/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 15:13:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOS0FDcVp1cmctR3RHWHdBNGctZFhHY240a0JZMTA5dG1sMm1UX2VVcTJwZmZ3dGczVTRSejViVUdDaWc3Y0hHLUZuVkVrYmVFNjB2WEhMdjdod283VjlFS2tFQnc3ZkNIeXBoRnE2OUJnVDJiZ01raDNVZlhqbFVYUm9vaVZOajhkVGhCM194MEhRdFpWV0hvMHJQdkQzTUpL</guid></item><item><title>不仅仅是你：蜱虫的情况越来越糟-《纽约时报》 | It’s Not Just You: The Tick Situation Is Getting Worse - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTFBqTlpSOElNdDUxNEdGaGl0MnlzZ096LUFmUFVtOUNCendFdkhHV0FlcHJDU0dlSHJtNEZKTl9sMlRBLXg0Mm4ySjJ4RkwyN3U5VktmMkgzRnEzWk02aEstYVNod3lxT2Mwdm13QzAtWUxUYms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 15:00:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTFBqTlpSOElNdDUxNEdGaGl0MnlzZ096LUFmUFVtOUNCendFdkhHV0FlcHJDU0dlSHJtNEZKTl9sMlRBLXg0Mm4ySjJ4RkwyN3U5VktmMkgzRnEzWk02aEstYVNod3lxT2Mwdm13QzAtWUxUYms</guid></item><item><title>服用维生素可以对抗感染吗？科学家解释- SciTechDaily | Can Taking Vitamins Fight Infection?

"The tumors are likely to be much less advanced and more likely to be curable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, plenty of questions remain as to how useful early cancer screening tests will turn out to be in practice, and researchers will have to figure out how to turn a positive test result into a potentially lifesaving early cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johns Hopkins team analyzed plasma samples that had previously been collected to study the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced genetic sequencing techniques, they analyzed 26 blood samples of participants who had been diagnosed with cancer within six months, and compared them to 26 other samples of participants who weren't diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that their "multicancer early detection" (MCED) lab test correctly identified eight as showing early signs of cancer. Four of the eight showed additional signs of tumor-derived mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows the promise of MCED tests in detecting cancers very early, and sets the benchmark sensitivities required for their success," said senior author and Ludwig Center at Johns Hopkins professor of oncology Bert Vogelstein in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, plenty of questions remain. For one, finding the best intervention if early warning signs do show up might be tricky, since current treatment regimens are built around detecting cancer so much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, we need to determine the appropriate clinical follow-up after a positive test for such cancers," said senior author and Ludwig Center professor of oncology Nickolas Papadopoulos in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other uncertainties include finding out which types of cancer MCEDs can reliably detect, and how effective these tests will actually be in reducing the number of cancer fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screening interventions that are done on very broad swaths of the population — most of whom will not benefit — should be very well characterized," World Health Organization epidemiologist Hilary Robbins &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00530-4" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.

For people with weak immune systems, this can lead to organ failure and even death. People with cancer, asthma, or HIV are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists say the fungus is spreading in parts of the US, especially in warm, wet states like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, and California.

That makes it hard to know how many people are getting sick or dying from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;People with weak immunity should avoid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say people with weak immune systems should avoid soil, gardening, and mold. They should wear masks in dusty areas and keep the air clean in their homes and hospitals. US hospitals are doing more mold checks and using stronger antifungal drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Aspergillus fungus also makes a poison called aflatoxin. This can cause cancer and damage to the lungs, liver, stomach, spleen, colon, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also Read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/what-is-fusarium-graminearum-the-fungus-us-authorities-say-was-smuggled-in-from-china-101749061874670.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="What is Fusarium graminearum, the fungus that 2 Chinese nationals allegedly used to target US food security?"&gt;What is Fusarium graminearum, the fungus that 2 Chinese nationals allegedly used to target US food security?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A scientist from the University of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/manchester-city" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Manchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; said that this fungus could change where plants grow and what infections people get in the next 50 years. He said hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 400,000 people develop a long-term lung infection called chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. A more dangerous form, called invasive aspergillosis, is less common but often deadly. It mainly affects people with weak immune systems and can spread to the brain, heart, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One study showed that only 59% of organ transplant patients lived for one year after getting invasive aspergillosis. Only 25% of stem cell transplant patients survived that long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2013, US hospital stays for invasive aspergillosis went up about 3% each year. By 2014, there were almost 15,000 hospital stays, costing around $1.2 billion. Autopsies in ICUs show aspergillosis is one of the top four infections that can cause death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus, an alarming threat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/world-health-organization" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="World Health Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says Aspergillus fumigatus is a top-priority fungal threat because it is becoming more resistant to drugs and kills so many people. The fungus grows well in warm, damp places. It can even survive in compost piles over 120°F.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of climate change, the human body is becoming a better place for this fungus to grow. A new study from the University of Manchester says if we keep using fossil fuels like we are now, the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fungus" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fungus"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; could spread 75% more by 2100. This would put millions more people at risk, especially in the southern U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drugs called azoles are often used to treat fungal infections in people, but they are also used a lot in farming to protect crops. Experts say using these drugs too much on farms may be making the fungus resistant. That means the drugs don’t work anymore, even in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study found azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in farm soil in at least seven US states. Many of these fungi are already resistant to regular antifungal drugs. Scientists say mixing of different fungus types is making the problem worse, and it’s already a big issue in US soil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;WHO asks for swift action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization is calling for fast action, better drugs, quicker tests, and more training for doctors and nurses. They also want drug companies to focus more on fungal diseases and test new treatments on children too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:55:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>杜勒斯国际机场爆发疫情的担忧引发警报-每日邮报 | Outbreak fears at Dulles International Airport as passenger with world's most infectious disease triggers alert - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNQkxYZ0ViVzY1UUlYSXVXR0JfZXhmdDRUakNTM016NWxhbFVYeU9Ma1JlYlVscWdqTW41NmZyWERya19jQ2FMMXRJY2FCOFpvQUtySE52eGpYZzh2aXNNbzdPX2t3bktoZnJHOWRsV2ZYTzAzd191X2g4ejNJcXVIdkp3Tmxqbm5HczMtR0J6dXcwNnFLeUxjSzF5NWtuWUcyMnfSAacBQVVfeXFMUDVkRGRXM1B1NjR5MTVfRVVtMDJXcnI1dEpQWmYzd2FYQkxsRnBrZzZzbWZ1OXRnTzBNcEQ3QU9yOGhWR2VEdGJ5UER4RDNYc0FUVjZwbjk5VklWcEk1VkV4aEZqVWlHREhFdVVKUGlGeG5OdHhNTFpiUHNZejYtTGFLZW9oeEFjNnM3T3NIeWNlM0I4X2FUcmhqckJMZmlDWkZMSnlzYms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Washington Dulles International Airport in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-fd12f6b0-fdae-11ef-a395-174b654ad242"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A passenger arriving on an international flight tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness, which is currently &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473199/texas-measles-outbreak-doctor-cases.html"&gt;ripping through the US.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Travelers who were at the airport, which serves the Washington, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-f5e547c0-4ab7-11f0-80ee-adf09d27bf09"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-be0303d0-4ab5-11f0-80ee-adf09d27bf09"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; region, on June 8 have been warned they could be at high risk of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infected traveler passed through Concourse A, took airport transportation to the International Arrivals Building (IAB), then visited the baggage claim area between 10:30am and 1pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, they took public transportation in the area on the same day, traveling on the Washington Metro Silver Line train from the Dulles International Airport station to the Red Line, heading towards Shady Grove station between 11:30am and 2:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14455647/Second-major-US-airport-red-alert-measles-jfk.html"&gt;Travelers who fear&lt;/a&gt; they may have been exposed are advised to confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To date in 2025, Virginia has three reported cases of measles, with another one of these cases also linked to a traveler at Washington Dulles International Airport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new case comes as Texas is battling a measles outbreak that has infected nearly 800 people and killed two children - and experts warn the US is vulnerable to even more measles outbreaks because of falling vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where late nights and early mornings have become the norm, &lt;strong&gt;sleep&lt;/strong&gt; has become a luxury rather than a necessity. The growing pattern of &lt;strong&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/strong&gt; across the globe has experts sounding the alarm: our current habits could have &lt;strong&gt;dire consequences&lt;/strong&gt; for our health and &lt;strong&gt;appearance&lt;/strong&gt; by 2050. What could this future look like? A recent &lt;strong&gt;study&lt;/strong&gt; offers a striking glimpse, showing the long-term effects of a poor night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Chilling Look at the Future&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking project, Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Sophie Bostock&lt;/strong&gt;, a sleep expert, teamed up with &lt;strong&gt;Bensons for Beds&lt;/strong&gt; to create a disturbing &lt;a href="https://www.bensonsforbeds.co.uk/sleep-hub/does-lack-of-sleep-age-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;visual representation of a woman’s potential &lt;strong&gt;appearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2050 if she continues neglecting her sleep. Named &lt;em&gt;Hannah,&lt;/em&gt; this model is based on data drawn from &lt;strong&gt;19 studies&lt;/strong&gt; published since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies have explored how insufficient sleep can damage various systems of the body, including the &lt;strong&gt;brain&lt;/strong&gt;, immune system, and skin. The result is an eerie visual projection that paints a stark picture of what lies ahead if these habits continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to the team behind the project, &lt;em&gt;Hannah&lt;/em&gt; is not just a fictitious character. She serves as a warning. Dr. Bostock explained, “The research on the importance of &lt;strong&gt;regular, high-quality sleep&lt;/strong&gt; for our health has accelerated in recent decades. Many people don’t realize that disorganized daily routines and a lack of sleep disrupt our &lt;strong&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/strong&gt;, the 24-hour cycles that govern our physiology.” The goal is to highlight just how impactful sleep deprivation can be when it becomes a consistent part of our daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Warning: The Health Toll of Missing Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The long-term effects of sleep deprivation on &lt;em&gt;Hannah’s&lt;/em&gt; health are both disturbing and revealing. Lack of sleep has made her more vulnerable to&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/alzheimers-molecule-restore-memory/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7424" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;memory loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with both short- and long-term memory severely impaired. A chronic lack of rest has also resulted in &lt;strong&gt;hair loss&lt;/strong&gt;, which is often linked to stress and poor health, while her &lt;strong&gt;skin&lt;/strong&gt; shows severe signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her eyes tell a similar story—puffy eyelids, dark circles, and drooping skin around the mouth are all consequences of consistent sleep deprivation. The model also shows how the lack of sleep has weakened her &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/earths-microbes-astronauts-healthy-space/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81359" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, making her more susceptible to common illnesses like the flu and cold. Moreover, poor sleep has left her prone to chronic aches, including &lt;strong&gt;back&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shoulder pain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most troubling is &lt;em&gt;Hannah’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;weight gain&lt;/strong&gt;. With only six hours of sleep per night, her body’s hormonal balance is thrown off, making it harder for her to feel full. This imbalance in hormones, particularly &lt;strong&gt;leptin&lt;/strong&gt; and ghrelin, has led to increased appetite and unhealthy late-night eating. As a result, she stopped exercising, leading to a significant increase in body fat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to Break the Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disturbing image of &lt;em&gt;Hannah&lt;/em&gt; is not just a cautionary tale but a call to action. To reverse the damage depicted in the model, experts recommend an essential change: getting between seven and nine hours of &lt;strong&gt;sleep&lt;/strong&gt; each night. More importantly, it’s about &lt;strong&gt;quality&lt;/strong&gt;, not just quantity. Creating a peaceful sleep environment—free from distractions like &lt;strong&gt;screens&lt;/strong&gt;, caffeine, and noise—can drastically improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bostock further emphasizes the need to establish a &lt;strong&gt;consistent routine&lt;/strong&gt;. “A regular sleep schedule helps stabilize your biological clock, improving both the efficiency and quality of your sleep,” she said. It’s also important to consider what you do in the hours leading up to sleep. Avoiding heavy meals, &lt;strong&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;, or nicotine late in the day will set the stage for a deeper, more restorative rest.&lt;/p&gt;

Early detection is critical — but so is what follows: interpretation, diagnosis and sustained treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/16/550x309/high_blood_pressure_1750074404363_1750074404599.jpg" alt="Know the mistakes that keep your blood pressure high, even with medication.(Image by Pixabay)" title="Know the mistakes that keep your blood pressure high, even with medication.(Image by Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/16/550x309/high_blood_pressure_1750074404363_1750074404599.jpg" alt="Know the mistakes that keep your blood pressure high, even with medication.(Image by Pixabay)" title="Know the mistakes that keep your blood pressure high, even with medication.(Image by Pixabay)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Know the mistakes that keep your blood pressure high, even with medication.(Image by Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens when all the right steps are taken and blood pressure still stays high? In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Viveka Kumar, Vice Chairman and Chief of Cath Labs (Pan Max) - Cardiac Sciences in Delhi, answered, “It’s called &lt;strong&gt;resistant hypertension.&lt;/strong&gt; This advanced form of high blood pressure persists despite optimal doses of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/medicine" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="medication"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; and consistent &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/lifestyle" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="lifestyle"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; changes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shared, “Something as simple as checking your blood pressure can lead to life-saving interventions but for many patients, especially those already diagnosed and on treatment, the journey doesn’t end with measurement—it begins there. When we see persistently high readings despite medication and lifestyle changes, it’s a red flag for something more complex.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/31/original/hypertension_1748688777354.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Youth are also vulnerable to hypertension risks.(Freepik)" title="Youth are also vulnerable to hypertension risks.(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Youth are also vulnerable to hypertension risks.(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Viveka Kumar added, “Resistant hypertension is not a failure of effort—it’s often a sign that we need to dig deeper. It could indicate secondary causes like renal artery stenosis or hormonal imbalances, or even issues with how we measure and interpret blood pressure. Recognising this allows us to not just detect hypertension but to treat it with precision.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Resistant hypertension is often missed or misunderstood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Viveka Kumar said, “Most people assume that when blood pressure stays high despite medication, it’s just stress or wrong medication dose but resistant hypertension is a specific clinical condition. It means one’s blood pressure remains above target despite being on three or more medications, including a diuretic. Yet, many patients are never formally evaluated for it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk? Dr Viveka Kumar revealed, “Repeated dose changes, without ever uncovering the real cause. It affects an estimated 10% of people with hypertension and is often under-recognised or misattributed to poor adherence or inadequate treatment — when in fact, it may signal a more complex or secondary cause requiring specialised evaluation and care. An elevated BP reading isn’t the end of the story — it’s the start of deeper investigation. It is the start of taking control of your health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Skipping medications is more common than you think — and often looks like “resistance”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a study in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings Journal, anywhere between 50 to 80% of people with hypertension don’t take their medicines as prescribed. Whether it’s due to cost, confusion, or side effects, &lt;strong&gt;non-adherence is one of the leading causes of uncontrolled BP &lt;/strong&gt;and can mimic resistant hypertension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/16/550x309/High_blood_pressure_often_has_no_symptom_1747392802806_1747392812660.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="High blood pressure often has no symptoms, so damage can occur silently over years before heart failure develops.

(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;High blood pressure often has no symptoms, so damage can occur silently over years before heart failure develops. Early detection and management are crucial. (Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before escalating treatment, Dr Viveka Kumar suggested it is crucial to check:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are medications being taken consistently?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are doses being adjusted appropriately?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are patients supported with the right information and follow-up?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to take control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It's not just about the medication, other factors play a role too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many assume that resistant hypertension simply means not taking medication as prescribed, the reality is often more complex. Dr Viveka Kumar explained, "Sometimes, it’s not just about the treatment, but about what’s happening inside the body. An overactive sympathetic nervous system can cause the body to stay in a constant state of "high alert," narrowing blood vessels and increasing blood pressure, despite treatment."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “Other factors—like kidney disorders, hormonal imbalances (such as issues with aldosterone or thyroid function), or sleep apnea—can also contribute to high blood pressure that’s hard to control. Even certain medications, including pain relievers, steroids and antidepressants, can interfere with blood pressure. Lifestyle choices, like too much salt, alcohol, weight gain, or ongoing stress, can make the situation even worse.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. There are newer, interventional solutions beyond pills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When medications aren’t enough and secondary causes have been ruled out, interventional treatments are emerging as viable options. Dr Viveka Kumar elaborated, “One of the most promising is &lt;strong&gt;Renal Denervation (RDN)&lt;/strong&gt;, a minimally invasive procedure that targets the overactive nerves around the kidneys. By deactivating these nerves, RDN helps reduce blood pressure, offering hope for patients whose hypertension remains uncontrolled despite the medical therapy. The procedure is gaining attention in India’s advanced cardiac centers, particularly for patients who continue to struggle with high blood pressure despite exhaustive efforts with medications and lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. India’s hypertension crisis makes resistant hypertension harder to catch and more dangerous to miss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is facing a hypertension epidemic. With over 220 million adults living with high blood pressure, only 12% have it under control. These alarming figures, from the NFHS-5 and national health programs, underscore a troubling gap — not just in awareness but in the ongoing management of the condition. In this context, resistant hypertension often goes unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Viveka Kumar concluded, “Many patients are not screened thoroughly enough, secondary causes are overlooked, and interventional treatments remain limited to a few advanced centers in urban areas. It’s time to act don’t just measure, take control! Resistant hypertension is more common than we realise in India and if ignored, it can lead to serious long-term consequences.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The goal of this collaboration is to help everyday people like me understand how food and general eating habits &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;impact blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"By combining Stelo data with Oura's existing insights, we're empowering members to better understand the cause-and-effect relationships between eating patterns, energy, mood and recovery -- and ultimately make sustainable, science-backed lifestyle changes," Maz Brumand, vice president of product for Oura, told CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've used my &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oura-ring-4-review-my-favorite-wellness-tracker-comes-with-a-pricey-caveat/" target="_self"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt; daily for the past three years to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-sleep-tracker/" target="_self"&gt;track my sleep&lt;/a&gt;, recovery and stress. But it was the first time I heard that a fitness tracker can monitor blood sugar levels. I tested the Stelo CGM with my Oura Ring for two weeks, and I can say that it changed the way I eat and move, and I think this type of biofeedback is helpful for everyone, even if you do not have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is continuous glucose monitoring, and why is it important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the measurement of sugar in your blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23509-glycogen" target="_self"&gt;glucose is the main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for your body -- it's what powers your muscles, brain and even your cells. When you eat certain foods (particularly carbohydrates), your glucose rises, and your body responds by releasing insulin to shuttle that sugar into cells for energy or storage. On the flip side, if you experience frequent spikes or crashes (even if you don't have diabetes ), it can impact your energy, sleep, mood and even long-term metabolic health. When your body doesn't need glucose immediately, it &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539802/" target="_self"&gt;stores it as glycogen&lt;/a&gt; in your muscles and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, monitoring glucose levels is crucial. But is it important to do the same for the rest of us without a diagnosis? To an extent, I think so. Monitoring your blood sugar throughout the day and seeing how your body reacts to different foods can reveal a lot about your cravings, sleep and metabolic health. "Glucose is a real-time window into metabolic health, which underpins how we feel day to day -- our energy, focus, mood and sleep -- and how resilient we are over time," Brumand says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of wearable glucose sensors like Stelo, those without diabetes can now get insights into how their eating habits impact their bodies (without finger pricks or a prescription).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a 'normal' glucose range, and are spikes bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using a CGM, I thought blood sugar was either stable or erratic, with no room for in-between spikes. Once I began tracking my glucose daily, I quickly learned that spikes are completely normal, especially after meals and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will see glucose levels rise and drop throughout the day. According to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, a general target range for adults without pre-diabetes or diabetes is between &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;70 and 140mg/dL&lt;/a&gt; (note that Oura also follows this range, and it's what users can expect to see in their graphs). It's also worth highlighting that 70 to 100mg/dL is considered normal for fasting (particularly in the morning before having food), and under 140 mg/dL is common, especially after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical studies show that even in healthy individuals, a moderate glucose spike (rise above 140mg/dL) can occur on a daily basis. In fact, research suggests that healthy adults will live above 140mg/dL for about 30 minutes, up to 2 hours a day, which is usually 1 to 3 short-lived glucose spikes", says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneefitton" target="_self"&gt;Renee Fitton&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and director of education at &lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/l-nutra/org-chart/renee-fitton-ms-rd" target="_self"&gt;L-Nutra&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that the number and frequency of glucose spikes depend on various factors, primarily what and when you're eating. These spiked can also be affected by other factors like stress level, exercise, dehydration and even whether you have a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many glucose monitors use a custom range that adapts to your body's baseline and patterns over time. When looking at your graph, it's important to keep in mind that context and trends matter more than one-off spikes. For example, seeing a spike after dessert isn't a sign that something is wrong. It's a sign that your body is doing its job. What matters most is how quickly your glucose returns to baseline and how often your levels stay elevated over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not see signs for concern for occasional (one to three times per day) moderate spikes (less than 160mg/dL) that resolve within about 30 mins. When reaching more frequent, especially if they are higher spikes (for example, above 180mg/dL), that take a long time to resolve (over 60 minutes), then there may be concerns about metabolic health," Fitton explained. "A completely flat glucose curve is not something that we aim for; you want some gentle ups and downs as a sign of healthy metabolic flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I set up the Stelo monitor with my Oura Ring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order the Stelo sensor through &lt;a href="http://ouraring.com" target="_self"&gt;ouraring.com&lt;/a&gt; ($99 for two sensors). I received a small box with the sensors and easy instructions. Applying it to the back of my upper arm took less than 2 minutes and was surprisingly painless. And yes, there is a small needle involved. I'm terrified of needles, so I spent some time mentally preparing to prick myself, but to my disbelief, I didn't feel it at all. The sound the ejector makes is pretty loud, though. I sometimes think the sound acted as a diversion to my brain, and that's why I didn't feel anything. But, nonetheless, it was a pretty pain-free experience. Once in place, I paired it to the Stelo app, and it automatically reflected within the Oura app. Each sensor tracks your glucose level 24/7 for up to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left Image: CGM in the self-injector.

You can easily access it at the top of the app, where you also see other data metrics like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-chest-strap-heart-rate-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, activity and readiness score (a personalized score, ranging from 0 to 100, that provides a snapshot of how well your body has recovered from the previous day's activities and sleep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How even my 'healthy' food choices raised my blood sugar (and that's OK)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eye-opening parts of my testing was seeing how some of my favorite healthy staples played out on the glucose graph. A great example of this was my favorite pressed juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a pressed juice in the morning that contained pineapple, beets, carrots, ginger, cucumber and lemon. It's nutrient-dense, but it also spiked my glucose above what's considered my healthy range for about 6  minutes (a small window and still considered optimal for my age and overall metabolic health). This was enough to make me rethink how and when I consume fruit-heavy beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I experimented with having a fruit smoothie instead of juice. I made a homemade smoothie with berries, banana, plant-based protein powder, peanut butter, soy milk and oats. This smoothie kept my glucose completely in range (zero minutes above my personal threshold). The added protein and fiber from the fruit, oatmeal, peanut butter and protein powder helped slow the absorption of natural sugars into my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I learned: Even natural fruit juices can cause glucose spikes, especially when consumed on an empty stomach and without any protein or fiber. Smoothies that include protein, fat and fiber can help keep spikes at bay and help stabilize your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance your meals with protein, fats and fiber &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that week, I had sushi rolls with a side of edamame for dinner. To my surprise, my glucose levels stayed within range the whole time. Oura Advisor (Oura's AI coach) even pointed out that this food combination offered protein and fiber, which likely contributed to the steady glucose levels. This moment was really encouraging for me. It made me realize that I don't need to drastically change what I eat. By just being more intentional about how I pair my foods, I can drastically improve the impact they have on my blood glucose. Pairing your foods with healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil can also slow digestion and therefore the absorption of sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton explains that this is primarily due to what happens in our digestive tract, even before the nutrients get to our bloodstream. Protein, fiber and healthy fats work in their own way to slow the absorption of simple carbohydrates into the bloodstream, making a slower, more gradual release of sugars into the blood. These factors turn what could be a glucose spike into a steady rise that your body can clear gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest area of concern when managing our blood sugar levels is limiting refined carbohydrates. When you do choose a refined-carb item (a plain cracker, white flour tortilla, cookies, etc.), try to pair it instead of eating it solo: add cheese, nut butter or a handful of edamame to blunt the glucose rise, and choose a higher-fiber version of your carbohydrate source when possible (for example, whole-grain crackers) so the carbs come packaged with their own speed limit," Fitton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cake and a walk equal steady blood sugar?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising things I learned was that blood sugar stability isn't just about what you eat. It's also about what you do after you eat. One afternoon, I had a slice of cake for a snack. No fiber or protein added, just the cake (I had lunch a few hours before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of my blood sugar spiking, my glucose levels remained steadily in range. The caveat? I took a brisk walk after having my dessert. It wasn't anything strenuous, just a short 15-minute walk around my neighborhood. But it was enough to help my body process and use the glucose more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body knows that exercise demands more energy, and so it helps open up our cells to soak up sugar (energy) and remove it from our blood. A 10-minute walk burns about 30 to 40 calories, and your body will get that energy from circulating glucose or stored glycogen," Fitton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating cake and going for a walk, my blood sugar saw a slight spike, but stayed within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/walking-after-eating" target="_self"&gt;walk after meals&lt;/a&gt; has long been recommended by experts for metabolic health, but seeing the effect in real time made it click for me. I do think that having the cake after having a balanced meal with protein and fiber also contributed to my steady levels of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it's not about completely eliminating our favorite treats or carbs, but more so about timing, food pairing and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways I learned to flatten my glucose curve without sacrificing my favorite meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using the glucose sensor with Oura, I assumed blood sugar spikes were mostly about foods and how they impact your body. I also thought the only way to manage them was to cut carbs or drastically change my diet. But over these two weeks, I experienced firsthand how and when I eat (and move) matter just as much as what I eat. I learned that these three strategies helped keep my glucose levels in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pair carbs and sweets with protein, fiber and healthy fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had a berry smoothie with protein powder and soy milk, my glucose levels stayed steady. In contrast, when I had a fruit smoothie earlier that week, my blood sugar levels spiked and crashed more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Carbs on their own, especially refined and processed carbs, can spike blood sugar quickly, but adding protein or fat slows digestion and leads to a more gentle spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food pairing examples: &lt;/strong&gt;Apples and peanut butter, toast with avocado, rice with beans or another protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniela Duncan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walk it out (especially after sweets)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had cake as a snack, I was sure my graph would spike dramatically, but it didn't because of my walk (and eating a balanced meal before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple walk, even just 10 to 15 minutes, can help offset blood sugar spikes. This small but simple habit helps me now enjoy treats without the crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timing your food matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that when I ate higher-carb foods earlier in the day, my body processed them better than when I had them later at night. Breakfast smoothies and bowls kept my levels stable, while the same smoothie after 9 p.m. caused more spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to blood sugar management, we see that in the morning our body usually has a spike in cortisol (a stress hormone) that can actually help our body take up sugar very quickly and quickly manage blood sugar. Eating in the morning will also calm the cortisol response, reducing the stress on your body. If you wait too long to eat, excess cortisol can create inflammation and also produce larger glucose spikes when you do eat," explained Fitton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that, conversely, in the evening, the sugar management systems in our bodies start powering down and are not as good at helping blood sugar get into the cells. So it is important to try not to eat too late; otherwise, you'll probably see blood sugar go up and stay up for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you can't eat carbs or treats at night, but eating them earlier in the day when insulin sensitivity tends to be higher can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPYmJIaGlBQ25NYUhNV0JxQktHTlc3LXhOTm9mbHdLYU11TVJUZXYxTHhNdHlZMkE1cDA4dVEtNkxPQThTQ1YtM1VkRkZ4SFc4MHRsdF9KVmRKdEQ1Uzh3UU1NWU9QbzdrbVNNUEFLTGdxanczdEd4Y3ExSDNleVJVNXVELVNSNXAtWjlWQnRpaFFBVVlEM3Q1QXJlVE1zMkpaVEc0S1k5WFZiM05TT1lwZlh4eHFnT3cwaEJQV1dfMkFmTVhKcXg0</guid></item><item><title>新的研究揭示了为什么大多数长期吸烟者不会患肺癌- AOL.com | New research reveals why most long-term smokers don’t develop lung cancer - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE50b3JKQXlpWHQ2MDljNkNqdTlzdm5nbjlVOU52WWlqamlhb0FQcW02ckRWamtWU1dkZzRPRDFMcGhFb3FlMi1oMXN5cUZjMllsZ1VMZHY2dTZKV1lhUUk5T29vNlRiOVlOaUxFaWQ3MEVsMDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;New research uncovers how smoking triggers DNA mutations in lung cells—insights that could help scientists develop better cancer prevention strategies. (CREDIT: Thinkstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer remains the world’s deadliest cancer, and &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/helping-low-income-smokers-quit-000700318.html" data-ylk="slk:cigarette smoke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt; is its chief culprit. Chemicals in tobacco, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), damage DNA and trigger the mutations that can lead to tumors. These toxic substances are among the most well-studied carcinogens known, making the link between smoking and lung cancer one of the most direct in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, there's a surprising twist: most smokers never get lung cancer. This mystery has puzzled scientists for decades. New findings suggest that certain people may have built-in defenses that slow or limit DNA damage. “Some smokers appear to possess protective mechanisms,” researchers report, sparking fresh ideas about how cancer might be prevented or spotted early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Risk Factors and Molecular Mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, studies have shown that cancer risk climbs with the number of cigarettes smoked, the length of the habit, and the age when someone quits. Still, 80 to 90 percent of smokers go their entire lives without developing &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/researchers-develop-urine-test-early-160700895.html" data-ylk="slk:lung cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And among those who do get sick, most are older adults. These puzzling statistics have led scientists to dig deeper, beyond habits and lifestyles, into the genetic and molecular clues that might explain why only some smokers fall ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Simon D. Spivack, M.D., M.P.H. (CREDIT: Albert Einstein College of Medicine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumors from smokers often contain tens of thousands of DNA mutations, most of them somatic—acquired during life, not inherited. But scientists know far less about how mutations build up in the healthy lung cells that might eventually become cancerous. One major focus is the bronchial basal cells, located deep in the airways. These cells are considered likely precursors to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/commonly-used-anesthetic-is-surprisingly-effective-at-killing-cancer-cells-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:squamous cell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;squamous cell&lt;/a&gt; carcinoma and silently gather mutations over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study these changes, scientists use a high-precision method called single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Unlike older techniques, WGS scans the entire genome of a single cell without introducing errors that come from growing cells in the lab. This allows for accurate mapping of real-time mutation patterns, even in cells that look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New breakthroughs now let researchers compare the mutation load in lung cells from smokers and non-smokers alike. By sequencing individual cells across a broad age range, scientists are learning how smoking and &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/groundbreaking-drug-reverse-human-aging-115100510.html" data-ylk="slk:aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; together drive cancer risk. This work is reshaping our understanding of why some lungs remain resilient despite years of smoke exposure—and why others don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Innovations in Mutation Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, researchers struggled to confirm the theory that smoking causes lung cancer by inducing DNA mutations. Sequencing errors in earlier methods made it difficult to distinguish true mutations from noise, delaying progress. However, breakthroughs in single-cell genomics have overcome these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan Vijg, Ph.D., a leading expert in molecular genetics, developed a novel sequencing technique called single-cell multiple displacement amplification (SCMDA). This method, first described in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4227#article-info" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Methods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, minimizes errors and improves the accuracy of mutation detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Albert Einstein College of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Albert Einstein College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recently used SCMDA to study lung cells from 14 non-smokers aged 11 to 86 and 19 smokers aged 44 to 81. Smokers in the study had a maximum smoking history of 116 pack-years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mutation accumulation in PBBCs with age in never-smokers. (CREDIT: Nature Genetics)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team collected bronchial epithelial cells during diagnostic bronchoscopies. These cells, among the most likely to develop into cancer, accumulate mutations from both aging and smoking. By comparing mutation rates in these groups, researchers have begun to decode the molecular footprint of smoking and its role in lung cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Decoding Mutation Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01035-w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Genetics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that lung cells accumulate mutations as individuals age, with smokers showing significantly higher mutation rates than non-smokers. These mutations include single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions. The findings reinforce the hypothesis that smoking accelerates mutation accumulation, increasing cancer risk. This aligns with broader epidemiological data showing that lung cancer is rare among non-smokers, while 10-20% of lifelong smokers develop the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the number of mutations in smokers’ lung cells rose proportionally with pack-years of smoking but plateaued after approximately 23 pack-years. This ceiling suggests a biological limit to mutation accumulation, even in heavy smokers. According to Simon Spivack, M.D., a pulmonologist and co-senior author of the study, this plateau may reflect enhanced &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/genes-can-now-be-studied-by-bending-dna-strands-with-light/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DNA repair mechanisms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DNA repair mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; or detoxification systems in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mutation spectra of single nuclei from never-smokers and smokers (left), and stacked bar plot showing the proportional contribution of mutational signatures to SNVs across all nuclei measured from never-smokers and smokers (right), extracted using a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). (CREDIT: Nature Genetics)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The individuals who smoked the most didn’t have the highest mutation burden,” said Dr. Spivack. “This indicates that their systems may effectively counteract further DNA damage, allowing them to survive despite prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Toward Early Detection and Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings open the door to new approaches in lung cancer research. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that protect certain smokers could lead to targeted interventions for those at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vijg emphasized the importance of developing assays to measure an individual’s capacity for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-proteins-repair-heart-muscle-and-regenerate-organs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DNA repair;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DNA repair&lt;/a&gt; or detoxification. Such tools could revolutionize risk assessment and early detection strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Spivack highlighted the broader implications of this research: “This may prove to be an important step toward the prevention and early detection of lung cancer risk and away from the current herculean efforts needed to battle late-stage disease, where the majority of health expenditures and misery occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A heatmap showing 6 germline variants associated to solid cancers found in each subject per column, with the presence and absence colored.

This approach could help identify at-risk individuals before symptoms arise, improving outcomes and reducing the burden of late-stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores the importance of bridging &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-theory-of-everything-connects-physics-chemistry-biology-and-evolution/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:molecular biology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;molecular biology&lt;/a&gt; and clinical practice. While smoking cessation remains the most effective way to reduce lung cancer risk, understanding the genetic and molecular basis of cancer resilience offers new hope. The ability to pinpoint individuals who are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking could enable earlier interventions and better allocation of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to refine single-cell sequencing techniques, the potential for breakthroughs in cancer prevention and treatment grows. This research not only advances our understanding of lung cancer but also sets the stage for innovations in precision medicine. By unraveling the complex interplay of age, smoking, and genetic resilience, researchers are paving the way for a future where lung cancer is not only treatable but preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;SNV frequency in the lung functional genome using scRNA-seq human lung data instead of GTEX.

Smoking tobacco introduces not only nicotine but also more than 5,000 chemicals, including numerous carcinogens (cancer-causing chemicals), into your lungs, blood and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The damage caused by smoking can shorten your lifespan significantly. In fact, smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women who smoke put their unborn babies at risk, too. Possible effects on &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/iron-infusions-are-transforming-pregnancy-care/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition when the embryo implants outside the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stillbirths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth defects, such as cleft palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low birth weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What other conditions may be caused or worsened by tobacco?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its known cancer risks, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; states that smoking causes many other chronic (long-term) health problems that need ongoing care. Specific smoking-related problems that need treatment include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decreased HDL (good) cholesterol and increased blood pressure (increasing risks for heart attack and stroke).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower oxygen to the heart and other tissues in the body (increasing risks for coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More frequent routine illnesses like colds, especially in children living with smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorer lung function (ability to get enough oxygen) leading to COPD, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/e-cigarette-use-increases-risk-for-asthma-by-252-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:asthma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, bronchitis, or emphysema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is titled, “Single-cell analysis of somatic mutations in human bronchial epithelial cells in relation to aging and smoking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Materials provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.

There were no complications and afterward Moreno was moved to the recovery room in a wheelchair before being taken to her mother's car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the drive home she was described as 'out of it', and fell asleep snoring loudly. She was taken to her bedroom, but then her snoring slowed and began to quieten — prompting her mother to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to the hospital after her heart stopped, reports said, where doctors tried to resuscitate her without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The San Diego&lt;span&gt; Medical Examiner's Office has now discovered in a report, viewed by DailyMail.com, that she was suffering from methemoglobinemia — a condition in which blood cannot carry adequate oxygen through the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition can be genetic, but can also be triggered by prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, which is often used in dental procedures for mild sedation and to reduce anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nitrous oxide normally diffuses directly into the brain after being breathed in through the nose, but can also enter the blood where it can&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14569099/mom-warning-hippy-crack-daughter-dies-nitrous-oxide-canisters.html"&gt; bind to hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, the protein that carries oxygen, and leave it unable to carry out its function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreno was receiving nitrous oxide during her appointment but it's not known if she had been previously diagnosed methemoglobinemia — which estimates suggest may affect up to one in 3,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Silvanna Moreno (pictured), 9, died after having dental surgery under anesthesia at Dreamtime Dentistry in March this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrous oxide exposure can appear in minutes to hours later, and include a bluish tinge to the lips, difficulty breathing and struggling to stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No foul play is suspected in the girl's death, which was stated as methemoglobinemia in the setting of recent nitrous oxide administration and ruled an accident by the medical examiner. There is no suspicion that anyone at the dentist's office acted improperly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In methemoglobinemia, blood cells contain a higher level of methemoglobin — a form of hemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, the blood contains about zero to two percent methemoglobin, but in methemoglobinemia these levels rise to anywhere between 15 and 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say that levels below 20 percent generally trigger no symptoms, while levels above 70 percent can prove fatal if someone is exposed to a gas like nitrous oxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965427/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; from Toxicology Reports estimates that exposure to nitrous oxide as a medical therapy is the second most common cause of methemoglobinemia — accounting for about 18 percent of cases in children and 13 percent of cases in adults among the nearly 300 cases surveyed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The genetic form of methemoglobinemia is rare, doctors say, with there being few reliable estimates on how many people have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Moreno's autopsy, carried out a day after her death, examiners found her blood's methemoglobin levels were 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They cautioned, however, that this may have been a significantly higher figure than that when she died, saying these levels can rise significantly in the hours after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dreamtime Dentistry (pictured), led by Dr. Ryan Watkins, said in a statement that the girl was awake at the time of her release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report also notes that she received other drugs while at the dental office, which they said could also have contributed to the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreno had received a root canal, placement of crowns and fillings and extraction of teeth at Dreamtime Dentistry in Vista, run by Dr Ryan Watkins, who has 20 years of experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a previous incident in 2016, however — revealed by online records with the Dental Board of California — he faced disciplinary action after a patient's heart stopped beating while under anesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual, who has not been named,&lt;span&gt; was hospitalized for two days and allegedly continued to suffer from a mild cognitive disorder for a year afterward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Watkins was placed on probation for 35 months by state dental regulators over the issue in 2020, meaning he could continue to practice — but only with enhanced observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement, Dr Watkins told People that methemoglobinemia is 'an extremely rare condition that can occur with nitrous oxide administration'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He insisted that Moreno 'never exhibited' any warning signs and that her oxygen saturation levels remained normal. He said he also undertook a 'thorough review' of her medical records before the procedure, which raised no concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the practice website, Watkins (pictured) is the only dentist listed who is trained in anesthesiology. There is no evidence of wrong doing and the dentist has not been charged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'We are committed to learning from this tragic event and will implement any additional safety measures that may help prevent such occurrences in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We extend our deepest condolences to Silvanna's family and ask for continued respect for their privacy during this time of grief.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day before the procedure Moreno had a fever and received Tylenol, but her symptoms resolved afterward — the Medical Examiner's report also noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day of the surgery, she also complained of a headache 'without appearing distressed', her mother said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dental office said if staff were aware of this they would not have carried out the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2-D08 also outperformed the approved therapy dalfampridine, sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ampyra-dalfampridine/"&gt;Ampyra&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., in its ability to repair myelin without inducing seizures, a known fampridine side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate significant potential for future clinical application of 2-D08 in MS treatment,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202502032"&gt;Activation of Kir4.1 Channels by 2-D08 Promotes Myelin Repair in Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is an autoimmune disease marked by progressive damage and loss of the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt;, a fatty coating that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. This is associated with inflammatory attacks that damage myelin, nerve cells, and the cells that produce myelin, called oligodendrocytes, giving rise to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Myelin sheath repair in mice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of self-reactive antibodies against the Kir4.1 channel, a protein that controls the flow of potassium ions into cells, have been found in the bloodstreams of MS patients. Kir4.1 channels are widely produced in certain cells that support nerve cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it remains unclear whether the self-reactive antibodies against Kir4.1 are a byproduct of the neurodegenerative process in MS or a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investigating and clarifying the [disease-associated] role of Kir4.1 is imperative to explore new therapeutic approaches that can benefit a larger proportion of MS patients,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team of researchers in China started their exploration by investigating Kir4.1 in a mouse model of induced MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood tests revealed significantly higher levels of self-reactive antibodies against Kir4.1 in MS mice relative to healthy mice. In line with this finding and previous reports, those antibodies were also significantly higher in the blood of MS patients than in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined mouse tissues, they found that Kir4.1 production was substantially reduced in the spinal cords of animals with MS-like disease than in healthy mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Kir4.1 channel deficits were initially detected in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) rather than astrocytes in the spinal cord, and MS mice genetically engineered to have lower levels of Kir4.1 channels in OPCs had more severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, the team searched for small molecules that could activate Kir4.1 and promote myelin repair. One molecule, called 2-D08, strongly bound to and activated Kir4.1 in OPCs but not in astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS mice treated with 2-D08 showed stronger myelin repair compared with untreated animals, as indicated by increases in myelin-related biomarkers. Treated mice also had more myelinated nerve fibers, thicker myelin sheaths, and more motor neurons, the nerve cells responsible for controlling movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment was also found to accelerate the maturation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When MS mice were placed on an inclined plane with increasing angles, those treated with 2-D08 showed improved motor abilities over untreated mice. In addition, hind limb placement while walking on a grid led to significantly fewer paw slips in treated versus untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Comparing efficacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate 2-D08’s potential as a therapy for MS, the team compared its efficacy to dalfampridine, which is used to improve walking skills in people with MS and is known to block the activity of potassium channels. It’s sold as Ampyra in the U.S. and Fampyra in other countries, with generic versions available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the onset of MS symptoms, MS mice received either dalfampridine or 2-D08 for 11 days. While both treatments had similar effects in easing disease severity and improving walking ability, 2-D08 showed a greater effect on myelin repair, as indicated by larger myelin sheath thickness than with fampridine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While dalfampridine is known to increase the risk of recurrent seizures, 2-D08, was found to promote brain functional recovery on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings without inducing seizure-like activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also evaluated the efficacy of 2-D08, administered daily starting at symptom onset, in marmosets with induced MS, a valid primate model of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month of 2-D08 treatment significantly repaired myelin in the spinal cords of marmosets alongside an increase in the number of mature oligodendrocytes. 2-D08-treated marmosets showed motor coordination recovery, as indicated by an increase in total jumps in the feeding cage. In comparison, untreated animals developed progressively worse disease, with their hind legs becoming almost paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the potential of targeting the Kir4.1 ion channel in OPCs as an approach for protecting neurons from demyelinating [myelin loss] injuries,” the researchers wrote. “It suggests that 2-D08 treatment holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for demyelinating diseases, including MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

When that failed, I had a mastectomy aimed at containment. By&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;September, that, too, had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZEGIRTMDJF57BU3EWIWIZ4JOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Metastasized Ewing’s sarcoma is so rare among older adults that the stats are mostly extrapolated from pediatrics. However, the best available data suggests that adults fare less well than children, with only about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/ewing-tumor/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;39 percent&lt;/a&gt; living five years after diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society.

This was bolstered by the fact that I have not been bedridden a single day. Losing my hair during chemo was miserable, but, until recently, I have been ridiculously healthy. People have found it hard to believe that I’m anywhere near dying, and there have been days when it’s hard for me to believe it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2SP2CR5NGZFIFIM6TZT36LS64I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of that resilience is probably in my DNA. I am not prone to depression, and my parents, Holocaust survivors and immigrants, were forward-looking and resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IPR6OYSB5ZEXDEMZJPUMEUAOSM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IPR6OYSB5ZEXDEMZJPUMEUAOSM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Role models&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZW5TQW6OZFAVFC7QOEDKYCT6ZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’ve also had&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;good role models for how to die. My mom, felled by a cancer recurrence at 86, was a dressmaker who continued to work until about six months before her death. She put her affairs in order so my father, my two siblings and I wouldn’t lose sleep over financial paperwork. She also reached out to home hospice, visited with friends, remained in charge of her life almost to the end and died at home. My father died less than three months later, at age 98. Neither of them expressed any fear. They felt as if dying was just a part of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TXNQQGPRQZFDNFD6EDKS463TZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m now trying to approach my own death with that perspective. Like them, I do not believe in a higher being who actively determines the spans of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBQ3LY2WNRCLVM6TQPDAOOW3QA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am grateful that my illness, although weird and random, is part of the natural world, unlike violence or a death for which there is someone to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LGL4DPB2JNARDKIOM47JSMJAIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I consider my disease a colossal case of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OSE43X5HCRD63ISVISUVQM7YKQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OSE43X5HCRD63ISVISUVQM7YKQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Would it help?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SVA7QBEMFGDBJ6I2PX5WOKSPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So how am I dealing with this unexpected twist of life? Sometimes help comes from unexpected sources. Last year, I streamed a 2015 film called “Bridge of Spies.” The lawyer played by Tom Hanks takes a Soviet spy to be exchanged back to his country and possible death. “You’re not worried?” the lawyer asks the spy. And the spy responds, “Would it help?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FSAFF7T3KJGODAU6DGW2YTN7OE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I start feeling grim about my situation, I’m finding it useful to take a “Would it help?” moment to consider whether my response can improve the situation or help me cope. I’ve learned that feeling sorry for myself doesn’t make me feel better, although I have been known to utter the passing “oy” or bemoan my inability to plan very far in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CEOL3P6275AQVBA7EMN77MAHKE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CEOL3P6275AQVBA7EMN77MAHKE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Following the science&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UWIF4CMPFBH6VFU6RBTESVLSZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What helps me most is to be curious and follow the science. To get a fix on what I’m facing, I have made judicious use of the internet, trying not to obsess on those dismal survival rates. To avoid the many overwrought and under-validated sites waiting to lure me  down the rabbit hole, I have relied on the previously excellent National Institutes of Health websites, where one can access the latest studies. Although I don’t always grasp every word and nuance, I can usually get the key points. Now I worry that the cuts to NIH staff and funding will eviscerate this critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QA3BCA5A2FGNZM2PZBEVWECQ3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am also very lucky to be supported by a wonderful network of family and friends. When I was first diagnosed, I gave my sister, Jane, full access to my MyChart medical record so she could help me assess information and options. It doesn’t hurt that she’s a retired doctor, but any smart and steady person with whom you have rapport can be a real help. She and my brother, Gene, also hold my medical power of attorney, should the moment come when I am unable to make my own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UGYJJ2OL2RGJFOIJL4RSP7S4LY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the September PET scan results showed up in MyChart, I recognized that my situation had slid into new and negative territory. I took a deep breath and called my sister; she and I agreed that it didn’t look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDDEDZATBZEP3ISTN4P3AKSR3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few days later, my brother came down from New Jersey, and we trekked off to see the leading adult sarcoma expert at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, who calmly and candidly laid out the limited options, none of them great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ERHFYUPXFCJ3N53KTF7XV3YDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were several additional&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8071040/" target="_blank"&gt; chemotherapy combos&lt;/a&gt; that generally made people very sick without yielding much benefit in terms of longevity. None of the new immunology trials had yet been promising for my disease. There was the option of chasing new tumors with radiation wherever that was possible. And there was the choice to do nothing. Although each case is unique, the expert said he thought I could expect to live roughly another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BCWLQ6MQRAKNISMHEMZACXRR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Later, my brother and I sat at a cafe by the waterfront, picking at a late lunch in the fall sun. “I’m a dead duck,” I said. “I hate when you say that,” my brother responded, “and we have to kepe some hope, don’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LBIYTL6WHBFX3MSVOKT4OUR5I4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the challenges is to live with uncertainty in roughly three-month intervals, from scan to scan, learning to balance acceptance and hope. It helps to remember that doctors are people with special skills, not gods. One of the things I value about my medical team is that they are knowledgeable and candid, without being self-important. I’m confident they do the very best they can, but sometimes they just don’t know. And they can’t always save you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GB3C2PG7OJGL3GNPHRJBK7FM2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I decided to pursue the radiation option. To date, I’ve had&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;three courses of radiation treatment, and the first eight months have passed. I’m still hanging in there, able to travel, to enjoy my friends, to write this piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H2RFFKINJBGFPHMRVYP5MER2ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So far, I am not a dead duck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:32:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOZ0pOeEtCS204ckZlS281UEVqOGVoODVuenkwSGtRbjJwQnFmS3FEU2JzaEswT2RudU1WcTFYRkRBQWU1dWUtQV9oMjE1ZTZPRkZUeTl0cEdXaEVvZVZmdEM5N1Mxd29rY2FuaDdEY3NTMllhdWo0M21hMUtsS1hIVDZ2dlZYcHpVd1lKU1ZTZHRGb0V6NUE</guid></item><item><title>专家们终于确定了自闭症的原因--具有里程碑意义的发现为药物治疗铺平了道路--《每日邮报》 | Experts FINALLY pinpoint cause of autism - landmark discovery paves the way for drug treatments - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxQSm5wbHhZRHE3bERteW5VOWhMM3BsdFRlRmZUcDdlOUVBVkVkdndSNW85NHUyeFNWLXVBR295bEYzeGk5SGFYWUFZTzFNMGpXVEo1RDFRd1J0SGtLeDJGQXZtT2E4MWJtVHl2eDFyY3hRRGtiajlUdUxjVnlBV2VUM21PdUZvNFA1UElvaU95aHZlSUNTRVA4Vk9YNkhZS0xudFZjMDRpTmdqVlh0UWEwcmstUTJSSWhCeVZZRndRVi03WGRmY2wwaVowbmJYTDN1NVpVTlNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark discovery by scientists has uncovered a common genetic fault linked to autism—raising hopes for a new generation of targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it has long been understood that autism often runs in families, exactly how inherited changes in DNA lead to the condition has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, researchers at Kobe University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-5da4fbe0-4aa8-11f0-8df9-b76db7cf3ec7"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; have found that many of the mutations associated with autism appear to disrupt the brain's natural 'maintenance' system—the internal process that clears out waste and damaged material, allowing brain cells to function as they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this clean-up system fails, as the study suggests it does in many cases of autism, waste begins to build up inside nerve cells, damaging their ability to send and receive signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This breakdown may help explain some of the core features of autism, including difficulties with learning, language and social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, published in Cell Genomics, focused on identifying what different high-risk genetic variants actually do inside the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have known for years that certain genetic mutations are more common in people with autism—but until now, there was no standardised way to study the effects of those mutations in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To solve this, the Kobe team created a library of 63 specially engineered cell lines—groups of cells grown in the lab that are genetically identical, allowing researchers to conduct consistent experiments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists have uncovered a common genetic fault linked to autism—raising hopes for a new generation of targeted treatments. Pictured, activist Greta Thunberg, who has the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Autism often runs in families, but exactly how inherited changes in DNA lead to the condition has remained unclear. Pictured, billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, who has the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each line carried one of the genetic mutations most strongly associated with autism spectrum conditions (ASC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These cells were created using mouse embryonic stem cells—taken from early-stage mouse embryos—which have the unique ability to develop into any kind of tissue in the body, including brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No human embryos were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To introduce the mutations, the scientists used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology that allows precise changes to DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It enabled the team to effectively model autism in the lab—creating what some researchers describe as 'autism in a dish.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From these modified cells, the team was able to grow various types of brain tissue—and even generate adult mice with the same mutations—giving them a powerful way to study how genetic changes affect both brain structure and behaviour over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they found was striking. Across many of the mutations, a common problem emerged: the brain's waste-disposal system wasn't working properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain cells—particularly neurons, which carry electrical signals and control thought, emotion, and behaviour—were struggling to get rid of faulty internal components.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the study puts it, 'a lack of quality control of these proteins may be a causal factor of neuronal defects.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors note this is 'particularly interesting since the local production of proteins is a unique feature in neurons.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In simple terms, neurons are constantly producing new components to help them send messages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if they can't clear out old or broken parts, the system becomes clogged and starts to malfunction—potentially disrupting the brain networks that support communication, learning and social development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The implications may go beyond autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the same genetic mutations are also found in people with other mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the authors note: 'Interestingly, the genetic variants we studied are also implicated in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, this library may be useful for studying other conditions as well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The research, published in Cell Genomics, focused on identifying what different high-risk genetic variants actually do inside the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope that by better understanding what these mutations do, scientists will be able to identify new drug targets—and eventually, develop treatments tailored to a person's unique genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While any clinical application is still likely years away, the discovery marks a turning point in autism research—moving beyond simply spotting risk genes to uncovering the biological chain of events that may cause the condition in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows soaring rates of autism—with a 787 per cent rise in the number of diagnoses in the UK between 1998 and 2019 reported in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;2021 study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month NHS data showed that more than 200,000 people—triple that in 2021—are waiting for an autism assessment in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous figures with ASC include environmental activist Greta Thunberg, 22, and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, 53, founder of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the condition affects people in many different ways, some autistic individuals do not view it as an illness requiring a 'cure'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they see it as a difference—one that should be understood and accommodated, rather than treated or fixed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Kobe University research is not the first to examine genetic links to the condition to provide an answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, experts found some cases of autism may be caused by the genetic condition myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with the little-known genetic condition were found to be 14 times more likely to develop autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies have suggested environmental factors could be a potential cause of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, research found a common plastic additive found in everything from pacifiers to metal foods had been linked to an increased risk of autism in boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It found that higher levels of chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in a pregnant mother's urine more than tripled the chances a young boy developing autism symptoms by the age of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those same boys were six times more likely to be diagnosed with autism by age 11 — compared to those whose mothers had lower BPA levels during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemical BPA is intended to harden plastics and prevent metals from rusting, among other uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been dubbed a 'gender-bending' chemical due to its apparent role spurring hormonal and sexual disruptions in humans, fish and other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Pictured, activist Greta Thunberg, who has the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Autism often runs in families, but exactly how inherited changes in DNA lead to the condition has remained unclear. Pictured, billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, who has the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each line carried one of the genetic mutations most strongly associated with autism spectrum conditions (ASC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These cells were created using mouse embryonic stem cells—taken from early-stage mouse embryos—which have the unique ability to develop into any kind of tissue in the body, including brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No human embryos were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To introduce the mutations, the scientists used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology that allows precise changes to DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It enabled the team to effectively model autism in the lab—creating what some researchers describe as 'autism in a dish.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From these modified cells, the team was able to grow various types of brain tissue—and even generate adult mice with the same mutations—giving them a powerful way to study how genetic changes affect both brain structure and behaviour over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they found was striking. Across many of the mutations, a common problem emerged: the brain's waste-disposal system wasn't working properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain cells—particularly neurons, which carry electrical signals and control thought, emotion, and behaviour—were struggling to get rid of faulty internal components.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;h4 class="orange-font print-yes"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h4&gt;
												&lt;p class="print-yes"&gt;CSHL researchers have revealed new 3D structures of the kinase FN3K, capturing the enzyme in different states for the first time. They found that human FN3K relies on the amino acid tryptophan for normal function. Their research could inform the development of future therapeutics targeting a variety of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
											&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes sugar isn’t so sweet. Sometimes, it’s downright deadly. Glycation occurs when an excess of sugars called reducing sugars attach to important proteins in the body. The process has been linked to diabetes and obesity. It’s usually something to avoid, and the body relies on the FN3K kinase to break glycation down. But cancer flips everything on its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain types of cancer, glycation prevents tumors from taking advantage of a protein that helps them grow and spread. In those cases, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor and HHMI Investigator &lt;a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/leemor-joshua-tor/"&gt;Leemor Joshua-Tor&lt;/a&gt; says, you don’t want FN3K involved. She explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="soundcite" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Joshua-Tor_tumor_needs_sugar.mp3" data-plays="1"&gt;“The tumor needs a lot of sugar to grow. Because of that, the sugar gets attached spontaneously onto this protein and dampens it. It’s like stuffing something in its mouth. The tumor can’t proliferate and grow.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FN3K’s role in breaking down glycation has been known for decades. But the structure of the kinase, needed for drug development, has remained a mystery until now. Joshua-Tor, CSHL postdoc &lt;a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/postdoctoral-research/postdocs/ankur-garg/"&gt;Ankur Garg&lt;/a&gt;, and their team have revealed 3D structures of human FN3K captured in different states for the first time. These structures could point the way to new cancer therapies, offering hope for patients suffering from the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_74304" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cshl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/FN3K_3D_structure.gif"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-74304" src="https://www.cshl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/FN3K_3D_structure.gif" alt="Animated gif of an FN3K 3D structure" data-headline="The Joshua-Tor lab worked with CSHL’s Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource to capture complete 3D structures of FN3K, as outlined here."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Joshua-Tor lab worked with CSHL’s Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource to capture complete 3D structures of FN3K, as outlined here.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kinases are common in our cells,” Joshua-Tor says. “So, in order to target only FN3K, and not the other kinases we need, we have to know exactly what it looks like. This gives us a precise model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model enabled the team to lay out the entire process by which FN3K breaks down glycation. They found that, unlike most kinases, human FN3K contains an amino acid called tryptophan. Yes, that’s the same tryptophan that knocks you out after a big meal. When the team removed it from FN3K, the kinase became inactive. And when they changed it to a different amino acid, it transformed FN3K into a “super-enzyme,” Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Controlling one tiny amino acid can control the whole enzyme,” he explains. “This is important for designing specific drugs to target only FN3K.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are now using the lab’s new structures to do just that. Future clinical applications are still far away. However, Joshua-Tor says the first step is to identify existing small molecules that bind to FN3K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really remarkable when you think about it,” she says. “These enzymes are so fine-tuned that everything has to be in the right state at the right time. It would be great if we could exploit that with an initial drug or molecule and go forward from there.”&lt;/p&gt;
