&lt;p&gt;Scientists have spotted unique subtypes of fat cells in the human body, and by unraveling their functions, they found that the cells may play a role in obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Jan. 24 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7269483237674841009&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-024-02048-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fanatomy%2Fscientists-describe-new-type-of-fat-in-human-bellies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-02048-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-024-02048-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fanatomy%2Fscientists-describe-new-type-of-fat-in-human-bellies" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, could theoretically open up avenues for new therapies to mitigate downstream effects of obesity, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finding these [fat] subtypes is something very surprising," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cris.bgu.ac.il/en/persons/esti-yeger-lotem" target="_blank" data-url="https://cris.bgu.ac.il/en/persons/esti-yeger-lotem" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Esti Yeger-Lotem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,a professor of computational biology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, told Live Science.

For example, fat cells, also called adipocytes, and immune cells work in concert to communicate with the brain, muscles and liver. This, in turn, helps to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regulate appetite, metabolism and body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it's also involved in related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If something is wrong there," within the fat tissue, "it affects other places in the body," Yeger-Lotem said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="not-all-fat-is-created-equal-3"&gt;Not all fat is created equal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also long known that carrying excess fat is linked with a risk of health conditions. However, one of the many aspects of obesity that have left scientists puzzled is that not all fat is created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat — fat cells that reside in the abdomen close to the internal organs — is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to a greater risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of various health problems than fat under the skin, known as subcutaneous fat. For example, excess visceral fat comes with a heightened risk of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, insulin resistance and liver disease. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies also&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest visceral fat is more "proinflammatory" than subcutaneous fat, which could potentially contribute to the ill health linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand what might be happening inside fat tissues, Yeger-Lotem and her colleagues charted a "cell atlas" of adipocytes as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body"&gt;&lt;u&gt;part of the Human Cell Atlas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a global project that aims to map all the cells in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers built this map using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA seq), which measures which genes are active and to what degree by looking at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular cousin of DNA. RNA molecules act as blueprints for proteins, shuttling instructions from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the cell's nucleus out to its protein-construction sites. By measuring RNA in the nuclei of cells extracted from fat tissue, the team gathered clues as to what each cell does inside the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeger-Lotem and colleagues examined samples of subcutaneous and visceral fat collected from 15 people during elective abdominal surgeries. Most adipocytes were fairly "classical" — meaning storing excess energy was their main purpose. But a small proportion of the fat cells were "non-classical," as their RNA suggested they carried out functions not typically associated with fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these cells were "angiogenic adipocytes," which carried proteins usually used to promote blood vessel formation; "immune-related adipocytes," which make proteins related to immune cell functions; and "extracellular matrix adipocytes," which are related to scaffold proteins that help support cells' structures. These cell subtypes, found in both visceral and subcutaneous fat, were also confirmed under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "state-of-the-art application" of snRNA seq suggests these cells may play a role in "remodeling" fat tissues, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" target="_blank" data-url="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Niklas Mejhert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of endocrinology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. Remodeling here refers to the way fat tissues change in response to weight fluctuations or metabolic changes. "Healthy" remodeling would help maintain metabolic balance, but if dysregulated, it could spur inflammation and other drivers of poor health in obesity, Mejhert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, scientists reversed type 1 diabetes by reprogramming a person's own fat cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also spotted differences in the newly described cell types depending on which tissue they were taken from. Unconventional adipocytes from visceral fat seemed more likely to communicate with the immune system than those found in skin fat, Yeger-Lotem said. This link to immune cells suggests the cell subtypes might play a role in triggering visceral fat's proinflammatory nature, which could help explain why belly fat is worse for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also hinted that the fat-tissue donors with higher insulin resistance tended to have a higher concentration of these unconventional cells in visceral fat than did people with lower insulin resistance. However, Mejhert noted that the authors did not prove causation, so it's not clear whether the cells might drive the insulin resistance in any way. It's too early to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these fat subtypes can be linked to human disease, understanding how they work could "help us fight inflammatory processes," Yeger-Lotem said. That could potentially help doctors predict the risk of insulin resistance in people with obesity, assuming all the dots connect, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berry cautioned that the study used a relatively small sample size and that, at this stage, it only suggests rather than definitively demonstrates that the fat cells have these unusual functions. Still, "these insights highlight the importance of understanding fat depots' unique behaviors to develop targeted treatments for obesity and related diseases," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK-Xrzuf1t0zNwaOIGEBWWT32npniqADavl" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK-Xrzuf1t0zNwaOIGEBWWT32npniqADavl slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Participants who received psilocybin demonstrated substantial improvements in emotional empathy compared to the control group, which received a placebo. These improvements lasted for at least two weeks after treatment. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It can be categorized into two types: cognitive empathy (understanding another person’s perspective) and emotional empathy (feeling what others feel). While empathy is essential for forming emotional connections, research suggests that excessive empathy—particularly emotional empathy—can contribute to emotional distress, especially in individuals who frequently absorb others’ negative emotions. As a result, heightened emotional empathy has been linked to an increased risk of depression and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests that psilocybin can temporarily enhance empathy, particularly emotional empathy, by increasing feelings of connectedness and reducing ego-related barriers. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms (commonly referred to as “magic mushrooms”) and is known for its hallucinogenic effects. It interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, leading to altered perception, mood, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Johannes Jungwirth and his colleagues aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on the empathy levels of depressed individuals and compare these changes to those observed in a placebo group. They assessed empathy differences at two days, eight days, and thirteen days after treatment. Their hypothesis was that psilocybin would increase emotional empathy and that this effect would persist for up to two weeks post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 51 individuals experiencing an acute depressive episode, 19 of whom were men. The participants’ average age was between 36 and 37 years. Those taking psychiatric medication were required to undergo a washout period before the study began. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin (25 participants) or a placebo (an identical-looking, inactive medication; 26 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved seven in-person visits to the research lab over a four-week period. The first visit consisted of screening. Participants then attended two psychological preparation sessions—one four days before treatment and another one day before treatment. On the third visit, participants received either a single oral dose of psilocybin or a placebo. This was followed by three additional visits at two, eight, and fourteen days after treatment. During these follow-ups, participants attended psychological support sessions designed to help them process difficult emotions and develop a narrative about their experience. At these sessions, they also completed assessments of empathy (using the Multifaceted Empathy Test) and depression (using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psilocybin treatment led to an improvement in emotional empathy compared to the control (placebo) group. This improvement was evident as early as two days after treatment, peaked at eight days, and was moderate in magnitude. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups regarding cognitive empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the eight-day and fourteen-day follow-ups, individuals in the placebo group who experienced a stronger increase in emotional empathy also tended to show greater improvements in depressive symptoms. However, this association was not observed in the psilocybin group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide evidence for the lasting effects of psilocybin on empathy in depressed patients, with significant increases in explicit emotional empathy observed up to 14 days after treatment. Given that conventional antidepressants have been observed to reduce empathy, psilocybin could be a promising candidate for enhancing social cognition and strengthening therapeutic alliance,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study contributes to the scientific understanding of psilocybin’s effects on depressed individuals. However, it is important to note that the study groups were relatively small, meaning some weaker effects may have gone undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;Psilocybin increases emotional empathy in patients with major depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by J.

&lt;p&gt;A blind Canadian man could soon see again thanks to a surprising source: his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Earlier this week, Brent Chapman underwent one of Canada’s first-ever “tooth in eye” surgeries. While it might sound like something straight out of science fiction, this jaw-dropping procedure has been restoring sight in other parts of the world for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a rare operation that most people have not heard of, even if you are an eye surgeon,” &lt;a href="https://drgregmoloneyvancouver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney&lt;/a&gt;, an ophthalmologist and surgeon at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital in Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The procedure, called osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, has been used in other parts of the world for decades.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors performed Canada’s first tooth in eye surgeries this week.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cheeky science &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis&lt;/a&gt; (OOKP), uses a patient’s own tooth to craft a support structure for an artificial cornea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The operation is broken down into two parts. First, Moloney and his team removed one of Chapman’s teeth, shaved it down into a rectangle, drilled a hole and popped a plastic optical lens inside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tooth then got a temporary home in his cheek, where it will stay for about three months.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“(The tooth) doesn’t have any connective tissue that I can actually pass a suture through to connect it to the eyeball,” &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/victoria-woman-becomes-1st-canadian-to-receive-rare-tooth-in-eye-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney told CTV News&lt;/a&gt;. “So the point of implanting it for three months is for it to gain the layer of supporting tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During the same procedure, Moloney prepared the eye by removing the top layer of the eye’s surface and replacing it with a soft tissue graft from inside Chapman’s cheek. This graft needs a few months to heal so it can support the implant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney said the initial procedure went smoothly, and Chapman will be monitored closely over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it’s time for the second surgery, Chapman’s tooth will be removed from his cheek and placed into his eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney and his team will pull back the graft, remove the damaged iris and lens, and sew the tooth (with its new optical lens) into the eye. The graft will then be resewn over the eye, leaving a small hole for the lens to peek through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end result is a pink eye with a small black circle through which Chapman will hopefully be able to finally see again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eyes on the prize &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A tooth might seem like an unlikely candidate for eye surgery, but it’s actually the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“(Teeth) contains dentin, which is the ideal tissue to house a plastic lens without the body rejecting it,” &lt;a href="https://thedailyscan.providencehealthcare.org/2025/02/canadas-first-tooth-in-eye-surgeries-aim-to-restore-bc-patients-sight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney explained to The Daily Scan&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, the tissue from the cheek recognizes the tooth, making the whole process smoother. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Surgeons typically use a canine tooth for the surgery.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get too excited just yet — this procedure isn’t risk-free. “With any ocular surgery of any kind, there’s a chance that we could introduce infection and lose all our vision,” Moloney told CBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also not meant for everyone. The surgery is often a last-ditch option for people with corneal blindness in the front of the eyes caused by conjunctival scarring from autoimmune diseases, chemical burns and other traumas, but who still have healthy retina and optic nerves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the risks, the procedure has been restoring sight for several decades in at least 10 countries with a high success rate. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 study out of Italy&lt;/a&gt; found that, 27 years post-surgery, 94% of patients still had vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney himself has done seven successful tooth in eye surgeries in Australia before bringing his talents to Canada. “The risk-reward ratio for these patients, when they have no vision at all, is well worth it, we think,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney has successfully performed the operation seven times.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A life-changing gamble &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman has undergone 50 surgeries over the past 20 years, all aimed at restoring his sight, and he hopes this is his last one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old massage therapist from North Vancouver is blind in both eyes due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare autoimmune reaction triggered by a dose of ibuprofen he took after a basketball game when he was just 13.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Though some of the surgeries he had gave him temporary partial sight, it always faded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I get it back, you know, it would be sort of this great rush,” he told CBC. “Then I’d lose it again and it would be heartbreaking, and I sort of sank into this depression.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, Chapman hopes things will be different. When his doctor first pitched the tooth in eye surgery, he was hesitant. But after speaking with an Australian woman who had undergone the same procedure to tremendous success, he was sold. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She had been completely blind for 20 years, and is now snow skiing,” he said. Today, Chapman is dreaming about shooting hoops again and traveling the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman is one of six patients in a pilot program at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital. If the surgeries go well, Moloney and his team plan to pitch Health Canada for funding to open the country’s first OOKP clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we’re successful in getting this up and running and stabilized in Vancouver, then we will be the only active North American center for the operation,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

I tried to stave off the inevitable by submerging myself in ice baths and drinking a brand of coffee that claimed to improve cognition. I paid too much for eye creams (to erase dark circles) and hair volumizers (to make my mane look fuller). I whitewashed my résumé, eliminating the year I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MK5ET53IZDBDNEASI5YMLRIHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I thought I needed to hide my age because of the ageism surrounding me: advertisements that depicted people my age as decrepit and frail, birthday cards that mocked us as deaf or daffy, and other media that simply erased us. For sure, I was not going gently into that good night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U65RTG35TFFN7AOVJ45D4OWQWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took me several more years to understand that there are different ways to understand ageism, including what researchers call “internalized ageism,” or discriminating against ourselves — and our contemporaries — as we age. Or as Todd D. Nelson, a professor of psychology at California State University at Stanislaus, who edited the book “Ageism,” put it: “&lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x?casa_token=Ki9-NmUKaHgAAAAA%3ARDOX-t29125hQrR2P5ZYcPhkHGPnOCIAbsXxjtoh_NqwhlEi8CdOdQQTSmZQMwle8QuyJ2r7GR53" target="_blank"&gt;prejudice against our feared future self&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C27WBUPA5NFBJE5QF2SDABB65E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sure, those of us 55-plus face negative stereotypes, bias and discrimination — in health care (exclusion from clinical trials because of age), on the job (being passed over for promotion) and by the media (all those “look younger” ads). But I finally realized that the antiaging messages I was hearing weren’t just coming from others. The awareness set me on a path to reverse my own aging biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QKM6M65MZAJ3OAL4SCCKH7ZIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Negative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07317115.2024.2355539#d1e223" target="_blank"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; with getting older have their own &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9757993/" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="525DQQCQBBFURN3CEAGJT6VEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LjiIqQDNPQ" target="_blank"&gt;Becca Levy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a leading researcher on the psychology of aging, has written that internalized ageism may take as much as 7.5 years off your life — about the same as heavy smoking. Levy argues in her book, “Breaking the Age Code: How Your Beliefs About Aging Determine How Long and Well You Live,” that those under 60 who hold negative aging stereotypes (frailty, cognitive decline) are more likely to have a heart attack or develop other cardiovascular conditions after they turn 60 than those who make positive associations with getting older (wisdom, loyalty, reliability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IKKE4BZPNEI7DHTXUW4UM744Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The way we think about aging affects how we age,” Levy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWTQWKBSEBFQ7P3PZIXPEVDUYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These negative associations get baked into our culture and our memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ3F3AH6QRGCTJPVXZIBUFTRA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be that way.

I joined one of his retreats in 2022, on the cusp of turning 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VGHTSDVBHK5AXZBYH2DGPPHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the MEA, I spent a week with 19 other individuals, hearing admissions such as, “It’s too late for me to learn new things,” or “I’m past the age where I can reinvent myself.” Conley warned us of the dangers of a “closed mindset,” or becoming rigid, fearing change and even believing it’s just too late for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFHYOGITK5F7VNBBLNTCEH7RO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an exercise called the Great Midlife Edit, we wrote down our associations with getting older on bits of paper. (You already know mine, which were very similar to the others’.) We then tossed these scraps — representing our old mindsets — into a bonfire, watching them incinerate. “We’re letting go,” a new friend said excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4BAHWFEGBCHDBXN75WJSANZBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the second day, Conley asked us to describe what he called “a replacement mindset” — a list of the positives of aging. There are plenty, including greater experience and wisdom, less judgment of others and more acceptance of ourselves, even increased contentment or equilibrium. I understood what Conley was saying, but it was going to take time for me to fully grasp the import of his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ"&gt;Putting beliefs into practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7I6XJO545FSJOG2GETW4FHUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the MEA, I began to think about intention and practice. Levy has outlined a three-stage process of bolstering positive age beliefs. The first is increasing awareness: “We know from our research that we often [hold] age beliefs without awareness and they can operate unconsciously.” She noted that children as young as 3 often internalize the age beliefs of the culture around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWBCGCDF2REC7PTSDXZYQ75APY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To combat this, Levy recommends journaling, “which involves writing down all the age beliefs you encounter over one week.” Was the portrayal positive or negative? Or were older people absent from a movie or a show, “because we know that lack of representation … can lead to them becoming marginalized as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OYFHY4IRD5GMXG4OOJAVE6KLFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her second exercise is to ask yourself: “Is what is said about older people ageist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SFWCTIMMFB2XD56FJJAAO5A6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ageism is considered one of the last acceptable forms of discrimination and can be challenging to call out. When you’re not sure if you’re seeing bias, Levy suggests changing the target to another marginalized group, such as women: “If an employee states the need to fire older workers, ask yourself how it would sound if the same comments were made about firing women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QN3VORSGH5F45BKQ7HD7PFCFEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, she recommends an exercise to dismantle negative age beliefs “by countering them with accurate information.” Consider the belief that cognition inevitably declines as we get older. “In fact, a number of types of cognition have been found to improve later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697608/" target="_blank"&gt;metacognition&lt;/a&gt;, or thinking about thinking,” Levy told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XCLFIPEUQRFYBONLROGVTNTRXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using her framework, I made a handful of pledges about how to reframe aging. Recently, I pointed out to a gift shop manager that the store sold only birthday cards that mocked older people. The manager, roughly my age, first took umbrage and then got my point, promising to order a different line. Similarly, when people tell me, “You look good for your age,” I nicely explain that that’s damning praise and ageist, because it implies most people my age look awful. (I know I’m looking a gift horse in the mouth.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y7PJZUFB6VEIFNS2YQHWG43ONU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m also trying to discourage the “organ recital,” that endless discussion of aches, illnesses and surgeries that dominates older folks’ social chatter and perpetuates negative stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NL7H4G6KFEVXPR7MK4FZGVS5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last and most challenging, I’ve stopped lying about my age, especially on dating apps. On my birthday this year, I posted a selfie, paraphrasing Gloria Steinem’s famous declaration, “This is what 40 looks like, ” except in my case, the caption read, “This is what 67 looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGJ4KS4JQVB7ZD6FLYGZINSUSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m not done, and will probably never be, but there are more benefits to be reaped. The authors of a study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-832261.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;note that inner acceptance of aging leads to less anger and anxiety and greater “calmness and serenity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YAZRKAMK5VBM7P6JIOEGGSDXOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m also reminded of what &lt;a href="https://awcim.arizona.edu/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2-Fellowship-USA%20(PSDW)&amp;amp;utm_term=integrative%20medicine%20andrew%20weil&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6oi4BhD1ARIsAL6pox0fm59KSCslsIHHhaVUdAMEe_33QtQHUhVmCo07UiZP1fcIWmyCNBIaArhfEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Weil&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona and author of “Healthy Aging: A Lifelong Guide to Your Well-Being,” has written: “We are not hostages to our fate.” Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 15:02:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVGFUUVJiRW5SMXd5US1JS05RQlNmdUFZS0ZDS2ZCaDlDSmoxeGhzSFJvSGdEM3JkUnltVXEwaE5uZGM2R3NUVnY5WGRvZUpKczloaFZhaWlHSkM2SExVbkFkU0NGWXYzVW9NV2NmSlNHRnV0cGpsdktWVll5dVE1amlHejNnb2g5ZGlYUXVnNm53Vjg4NTdkSklvWEI</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. Readies CDC For Changes In Vaccine Policies - Forbes</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPUjJUYlNhUmoxZ1RkQUdSQktaOXZzMzBVXzRFVlNMOE5PeTVzMEo3N1ZlZXIwN3VMM3JwWmVJMkpTa0ljczA3QUt2azJCeWJfdmdVUjZsUlZtbHVTVnhjZFl4QlNvR1hUdG9hdkpIMlZCQVRMbVBLRk1mVWJheGxFM3FMZTMtUjFWQU9KNzJFeEREWl9YZ1V3SE1PYXFkd29HelE0bkR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article article-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-0" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 13: Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears to be gearing up for potentially substantial changes in vaccine policies, specifically with respect to the federal government’s messaging and the composition of the advisory panel responsible for making recommendations on vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is planning to remove several members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices due to what he &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" aria-label="views as conflicts of interest"&gt;views as conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP advises the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on which vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used; for example, recommending which groups of people ought to be vaccinated, at what doses and when. ACIP’s guidance is not binding, though CDC almost always follows it and provides recommendations to the public on what is to be included in the United States adult and childhood &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" aria-label="immunization schedules"&gt;immunization schedules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of HHS can hire or replace ACIP committee members, which may lead to new sets of CDC recommendations. ACIP’s first scheduled meeting since Trump was inaugurated &lt;a href="https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" aria-label="was postponed"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04"&gt;was postponed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week It’s not clear at this time exactly what this postponement signals, though in light of other changes within HHS it may be a foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the CDC has been &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" aria-label="ordered"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; to shelve promotions it developed for multiple vaccines, including a “Wild to Mild” advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against influenza. Secretary of HHS Kennedy says he wants advertisements that incorporate a more robust version of “informed consent.” Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any therapeutic they are prescribed. The Wild to Mild ads emphasizes the harm-reducing functions of vaccines, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women, young children and the immunocompromised. Evidently, Kennedy wants messages that are more focused on potential adverse events associated with vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just this week the FDA canceled a meeting of its flu vaccine advisors. The panel was set to convene to discuss the composition of the 2025-2026 influenza vaccine.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" aria-label="has previously said"&gt;has previously said &lt;/a&gt;that he is concerned about the pharmaceutical industry’s close relationship with government agencies and the entities such as ACIP that advise them. But it’s unclear what Kennedy means when current ACIP members include several academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up and the owner of a family medicine practice. (We reached out to Kennedy’s office for comment, but did not receive a reply)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at HHS are taking place against the backdrop of a large &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" target="_self" aria-label="measles outbreak"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; which began in West Texas and thus far has claimed the life of a child and hospitalized 19 others. Practically all the people who’ve contracted measles are unvaccinated. Yet Kennedy seems to be &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" aria-label="downplaying"&gt;downplaying&lt;/a&gt; the situation in Texas and New Mexico, suggesting that such outbreaks are not unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine-skeptic views are well-known. And while he &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" aria-label="told"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that some vaccines “are probably averting more problems than they’re causing,” he also maintained that “there’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” Kennedy recently informed employees within his department that he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" aria-label="vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule"&gt;vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; that prevents measles, polio and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this doesn’t come as a surprise. Kennedy has invariably been outspoken on vaccines and what he sees as public health agencies’ “suppression” of controversial treatments. Just prior to the November election, Kennedy &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" aria-label="posted"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on X, warning the FDA that its “aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, [and] hydroxychloroquine” was about to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" target="_self" aria-label="embroiled in a culture war"&gt;embroiled in a culture war&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic that pitted unproven treatments against proven measures, such as vaccines. Kennedy defends himself as merely wanting placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure and no vaccine mandates. However, the vaccines he rails against are typically subject to such clinical trials. Furthermore, arguably the mandates Kennedy opposes, which have been in place since the 1960s, have helped to contribute to a dramatic decline in childhood infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From smallpox inoculations—which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s—to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccinations have saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, mass vaccination programs with single or combination—measles, mumps and rubella—shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is “&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" aria-label="sterilizing"&gt;sterilizing&lt;/a&gt;,” which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the Secretary of HHS nor the CDC director can unilaterally ban vaccines. But they can alter the CDC’s messaging, hire and fire ACIP committee members and revise vaccine scheduling. The fact that the HHS secretary and probable CDC director, nominee Dave Weldon, have aligned views could facilitate the process of transforming vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" aria-label="bill"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; which Weldon sponsored sought to undo what he saw as a conflict of interest entailed by CDC being both a promoter of vaccines and an evaluator of their safety. This echoes Kennedy’s opinion on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Weldon be confirmed, he will be making the decisions regarding whether a vaccine should be recommended to the public. Negative guidance from the CDC director could affect insurance coverage because insurers are only obligated to cover vaccines that have been recommended by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;

meant to be given to children in a series of two shots at 12 to 15 months old as well as between the ages of four and six years old – through its immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Earlier, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upheld the role of vaccines in offering protection against measles after an unvaccinated child died from an infection this week. The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group. However, he has claimed he is not “anti-vaccine” and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A total of 164 measles cases were reported as of 27 February across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas, information from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; showed. About 95% of those infected were unvaccinated people, including children whose parents did not follow CDC recommendations to get them immunized with safe, effective vaccines providing protection against measles as well as other easily preventable diseases. Another 3% were from people who received only one of the two required shots for immunity, CDC data showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These cases were reported in nine jurisdictions, including Kentucky, marking a near 80% jump from 93 cases reported a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also on Friday, Kennedy’s health and human services department announced plans to eliminate public participation in many of the agency’s policy decisions – a proposal that explicitly flouts a promise of “radical transparency” that he previously made to Congress while lawmakers considered confirming his appointment to the cabinet of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The health and human services department has allowed such public comment on a range of agency actions for decades. It would mark a noted shift in the rulemaking process at the agency, which directs $3tn in healthcare spending and oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid – which insure more than 140 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters contributed reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 14:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcmJpTjdaUXp4UFNIeXNOdmZMZk04MFNZczNUQS01dmJyWVdkTVBpbndMWTZDZzc4ZWpIaXd3T3hodEx5LTVWV2RNZ0FFbXdjWVQwdmdBaFJmb21Kc0dRdDlvb2dCRUp5dTR1d3ZHbVNrUTFHc0s1ODl3NU5RTFNZUEotVS1LcE8wVFh1TVR2YTNPbjZaMUVmTQ</guid></item><item><title>13 Foods to Boost and Strengthen Your Kidneys - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9lSTVDdGh3YnFORmJaZWY4UG1mYVV6WGVNRWJFZVBoSmh5RHdrTjBVOXFMMnJ0Qk5UR2FGR2Z4WDd5aGRrQUxyRTVzRU03dW83d0NHa0tHVUtSaGlWVVVfRTM1bXU4MmFCWWtRclA2a19XYVFCS2UyZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;According to the CDC, it is estimated that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-id="f698660b-7fea-41dc-b9d7-388be0bc7f03" href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidney-disease/about/index.html" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;over one in seven&lt;/a&gt; US adults has chronic kidney disease.

To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak "not unusual", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions," Leah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;In Lubbock, worried parents and doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting.

We can't do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community," said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I share that concern with them," said Dr Malbari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy stays mum on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine skeptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to "do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult" to get vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is "what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In addition to calling the Texas outbreak "not unusual", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a devastating disease," he said. "And it's completely preventable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Vaccines as a 'choice'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more," he said.  "It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 08:33:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE81eGNfdEFQT2txcG1aY2pzSWhlWEtveFUyMXg0d013VUxIWTdTSFkzWkNXTGJYSE1rdXNFNVQ5Wi1DbGpBMWpsaTR5QlN2VjJIWEZlWTNOQ19MUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1WS0sxOHpVOXFMM0RwdzMyblpxa3hKNFBwSjYtVk1QN1V5dGFpMTlTWXdYR1pUOW9KVWdNWFRmWWFlNHctSXdmQTF3VkdONkFzS0VseDVjTHVlaW14TkJn</guid></item><item><title>1 Gram Of This Nutrient Can Slow Down Ageing (And It’s Very Common!) - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOUmgxaDVZS0NVQjllb19maDZyOXVWX2FpZENjbXlMa21TV1BhY28zSVJqS2lHWWZXdk5EMVZIZjJhT1pYMFFsYnptclQ3MTdvbUhJV050blJ4RmJzdkk4VmhJZ1hHMDZWeGE2YmlYalRvVFhVMnBseTQ4VDJONzd2U2lYWE1LU3ZyX3JLaGd0d3BEd2w5VE9Ra3RmWjR3d9IBpAFBVV95cUxOX3dVU0NMQUk5Umt1X3hnNlVZWjhPaWUzbXFvYlZjT3lnQmVJbVlycENxWTd4ZjNiWVg4djlueUp0OVhxN2F0MFdSdldxSGNVaGZRVWdWV3VQR0FwY1pOT05EOHNnQThZNEV1MXNFUDEzMzE0SHkwTDJ2WDJvZFE3M0hOOUxKZTlXTk1EZEgtb3lHTVZMdGYtbjRxN3lYT0pBcVFoWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hit a, let’s say, &lt;em&gt;certain age&lt;/em&gt;, you notice that &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/anti-ageing/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="anti-ageing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bde115e4b0d509934a48e0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/anti-ageing/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;anti-ageing&lt;/a&gt; promises are everywhere.

Experts “think it’s something lifestyle and environmental, but exactly what that is, we don’t know,” Cecchini said. Researchers are investigating what could be happening. In the meantime, it’s important that you stay alert about colorectal cancer ― even if you’re young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of this is knowing the warning signs.

She thought that she had irritable bowel syndrome, so she didn’t go to the doctor at first. When she finally did, she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what experts say about this particular issue:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrow stool can be a red flag.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors will sometimes see patients whose “stools are much thinner, or they’re pencil in thickness and size, which is a description that some patients with colorectal cancer will have,” Cecchini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tends to occur if tumors are present near the end of the colon or if they line the entire inside of the colon, which narrows whatever stool passes through, Cecchini explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy stool should be long and sausage-shaped, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320938" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to Medical News Today" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09181e4b08e33534cd1f8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320938" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;according to Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, and come out as one piece or several smaller pieces. What’s most concerning is when thin stools are a new change that’s persistent, said &lt;a href="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Jeffrey+M.+Dueker/1326192" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jeffrey Dueker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09181e4b08e33534cd1f8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Jeffrey+M.+Dueker/1326192" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Dueker&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at UPMC and an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dueker, any noticeable alteration in your bowel habits could be a potential red flag (but, he stressed, is not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a sign of colon cancer). In addition to a change in stool shape or consistency, this can include going to the bathroom more or less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pencil-thin poop is one of the less common signs of colorectal cancer. “When it exists, it is highly concerning,” Cecchini said. “It’s just not one of the more common symptoms of the disease.” The more widespread signs are blood in the stool and abdominal pain. Unintentional weight loss is another sign. And some cases of colorectal cancer have no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: MoMo Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;MoMo Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Flag any concerning symptoms to your physician.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you notice any symptoms, you should tell your doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should never discount your symptoms, Cecchini said, if you notice blood in your stool, chronic abdominal pain, a change in bowel movements, or unexplained weight loss, it’s important that you tell your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very easy in younger individuals to think, ‘Oh, it’s just hemorrhoids,’ or something like that ... and it may be, but also those things can coexist,” said Cecchini. “People certainly have hemorrhoids and cancer, or it can be something else completely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, getting a colonoscopy or another colorectal cancer screening is the best way to lower your risk or catch it in the early stages. You can undergo “screening with colonoscopy or stool-based tests,” Cecchini said. Chat with your doctor to determine the best screening for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, screenings start at 45. But if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above or meet certain criteria, you may be eligible for a &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colonoscopy-before-45-signs_l_65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="colonoscopy before 45" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09181e4b08e33534cd1f8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;colonoscopy before 45&lt;/a&gt;, Dueker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with a first-degree relative — mother, father, brother, sister, son or daughter — that has had colon cancer, especially if that person was diagnosed before the age of 50, is going to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer because of that family history, and should speak to their doctor about when they should start getting colonoscopies,” Dueker explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had inflammatory bowel disease or radiation treatment to the pelvic or abdominal area, or if you have certain genetic syndromes or a personal history of colon cancer, you would also want to get a colonoscopy before 45, Dueker noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, it’s important to keep your doctor informed of your medical history and any potential issues you might be experiencing.

The vaccinations provide 97% protection once both shots are administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high protection rate the vaccinations give, some parents remain concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There’s still a 3% chance of them contracting the disease, and again, I hope that doesn’t happen and it’s less likely, but it’s all risks,” parent Molly Gray told KOMO News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents like Gray are ensuring their children are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually just called our doctor to make sure our 4-year-old was fully vaccinated because I think 4 is the age where they can have their second dose and we double-checked because we want them to be as protected as possible," Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Child dies in measles outbreak in Texas as Washington officials urge vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvia Maggio, another parent, expressed relief at having vaccinated her children but acknowledged the vulnerability of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We got the alerts about where that child had been, and we had also been to the ER at Seattle Children’s in recent weeks,” said Maggio. “I feel grateful that we’ve had the opportunity to get those MMR vaccinations out of the way but there are a lot of vulnerable children who don’t have that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials advise checking vaccination status and recommend contacting a doctor before visiting if exposure or symptoms are suspected to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County reported three measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,” said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. “There’s only a few viruses that even come close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had measles once can’t get it again, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you prevent measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got” measles, Weaver said. "But then when the vaccine came along, that was a complete game-changer and one of the most successful vaccines in the history of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is “great data” on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any of these outbreaks we’re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,” he said. “If we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we’re not going to see this happening in the future. And we’ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said. "If people would just get the standard vaccination, none of this would be happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press reporter Laura Ungar contributed to this report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 04:07:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxObWFWOTdMTWxuZWpYNTMyYVR3MDZkUk1EbzZKWDhKVDVkalYxSWJHaHlkcGQ2UUFOSk51VmNXQ2ZValN2YjU1eEx5SWloUm85TXhBNnRCV0Rlb0oyVkRtdENYSzlYeVV3Sjl6azVPemJIYndHX1lVa1NYUTNmX2NYT29LQmVLd3ZkNGc0SkF6V3haMXRjbnRUYWZEV3FHY1hLa1JvV3lGN093eUF0OFdla2tiQ2pJSndMS2QxeEgyN0dVbExBQUwwY3B1aDk5Y3RVR0hNUC16d2l2azN4MDdsZWdMYnV2dWFwc0VsVS13</guid></item><item><title>Health officials say they have a confirmed measles case reported in Austin - KVUE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNR25GdUFGWXdPQnlFQjJvLVZWMGZQb2JWalVteUR1cWo0RnQ1a1hjOS1ZYUtuc0tVenJxVlJwbUFTbHp5empMNGpiR0xaTWFKaTRIOER6WFNNRk8zR3Znbi1xdjNPNkktMS1vR3hBRzd2cWNFdVdaVGU1WldEaUp5Z2x6bDByRHc1aHM2aGZ5ZHpRMkRBSU1qRXktZDJacTR3enFwNTAyNnlVdTQ0S2RISmpXR01aUDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Most of the recent confirmed measles cases in Texas have been in the South Plains region, but this patient was exposed to the disease while traveling overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — Health officials say they have confirmed a case of measles in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a press briefing Friday, Austin Public Health confirmed that an unvaccinated infant was exposed to measles while traveling overseas. Everyone else in the child's family is vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said contact tracing is complete and they don't expect additional exposures. The child and their family members are all isolated at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It certainly raises our level of concern, our level of readiness, but we've been ready," Austin Travis County Public Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes said. "We've been planning for over a year for the possibility of a measles outbreak because we've known that our vaccination rate has been declining. We've been working hard to get people vaccinated, and we're calling for people to get vaccinated now, if they're unvaccinated, to protect themselves."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes said the case is not related to an ongoing measles outbreak in the South Plains region of Texas, where &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-outbreak-texas-2025-update/285-dded2ec7-e37b-42f7-8adb-2956fdb329bc"&gt;146 cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; as of Friday, Feb. 28. Twenty of the patients have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child has died, marking the first &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af"&gt;measles death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. To give you a sense of how contagious this virus is, doctors say if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles virus can survive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected person has left the area," Walkes said. "People who have direct contact through coughs or sneezes should monitor for symptoms for up to 21 days after exposure."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health officials stress that there is no local outbreak, but they say now is the time to take precautions and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR – measles-mumps-rubella – vaccine is highly effective in protecting against measles. According to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), one dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles and two doses are 97% effective against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know how to combat this, and we need that vaccination rate to increase in our community by coming together, getting vaccinated, and prioritizing public health," Travis County Judge Andy Brown said. "We can do this together. The steps are simple. Get vaccinated if you haven't already."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to state health data, Travis County's MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners is just under 90%. Doctors say communities need 95% immunization rates to have "herd immunity."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that worries local leaders is the under 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners at some schools, which health officials said increases the risk of an outbreak by 51%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're continuing to work with those school administrators to get vaccines in arms," Walkes said. "We've been having clinics. Our mobile team has been educating families, and we're continuing that work and that effort. It'll be ongoing until we get the job done and get the message to parents that need to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said kids as young as a year old can get their first dose of the MMR vaccine and the second when they're between four and six years old. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If everybody else had their kids vaccinated at the proper ages, this would not be an issue," Brown said. "By not vaccinating your child at the proper ages of 12 to 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years, you're putting other infant children at risk. You're putting our community's lives at risk. You're putting our economy's life at risk."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a parent is going to an area where measles is prevalent, Walkes said the child should be vaccinated earlier, at six to eleven months. Walkes said that guidance may change if we see more cases in the Austin area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we do have an outbreak where we see more than three or more cases in our area, then we will change our guidance," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), of the 146 cases, 98 have been reported in Gaines County, and 21 have been reported in nearby Terry County. Most of the cases have been among children. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHS reports that 79 of the 146 patients were unvaccinated, 62 have unknown vaccination status, and five have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no local outbreak right now, Walkes said she and her team are prepared for the worst but are hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been in contact with our hospital partners and clinics and folks across our jurisdiction, and they are ready and prepared and have processes in place to handle people who may contact them saying that they have symptoms of measles," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another primary concern for local leaders is South by Southwest (SXSW) starting next weekend. As hundreds of thousands of people descend upon Downtown Austin, they don't want that to become a super spreader event. They are encouraging those in the community who aren't vaccinated to get vaccinated. The city and health department say they are working with organizers on health precautions for the event.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We work in collaboration with Austin Special Events to help them mitigate and strategize for health precautions for events," Walkes said. "Our team has been in contact with them and our business partners across the city."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to get the vaccine can do so at doctor's offices and pharmacies. The health department offers the MMR vaccine at its "Shots for Tots" and "Big Shots" clinics. You can find information about those &lt;a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/immunizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Children under the age of 14 do need a prescription from a doctor to get the vaccine at a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

And then it's like, 'Oh, the right side of my body is dipping,'" she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At first, Walsh wasn't sure what was going on, especially since people kept telling her she was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They're like, 'Oh, you're off.' I'm like 'No,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walsh also felt strange while walking her dog one day and recalled thinking the street must be "windy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It was just sort of very subtle and then very kind of, 'Oh it's ADD. I can't really focus. Oh I've been scrolling too much.' That kind of stuff," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Going through this health scare taught Walsh a lesson that she's hoping to share with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I know how important it is to advocate for one's own health because people were like, You're just depressed.' It was right after (my TV show) 'Bad Judge' got canceled. 'Your show got canceled. You're just depressed,'" she recalled others saying. "I'm like, 'No something's off.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Walsh appeared on "The Kelly Clarkson Show" on Feb. 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, Walsh acknowledged that it's challenging to advocate for yourself in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's a hard thing when you have everybody looking at you going, 'Hmm, I think you're just this or that. You're tired,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2017, Walsh &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/kate-walsh-opens-about-being-diagnosed-very-sizable-brain-tumor-t116425" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:appeared on TODAY;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;appeared on TODAY&lt;/a&gt; to discuss her diagnosis and recovery. After feeling “exhausted,” she decided to seek medical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But I’d just wrapped a show, ‘Bad Judge,’ and I was starring in it and executive producing, so it wasn’t unheard of to be totally exhausted. So I thought I just really burned myself out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soon enough, Walsh started experiencing cognitive symptoms and "couldn't find my words."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After fighting for a diagnostic MRI, Walsh learned that she had a “very sizable tumor.” Following a surgery, she discovered that it was benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The non-cancerous tumor was known as a meningioma, which &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/meningioma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:John Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;John Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt; defines as "the most common type of primary brain tumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These tumors originate in the meninges, which are the outer three layers of tissue between the skull and the brain that cover and protect the brain just under the skull," the John Hopkins Medicine website reads.

			&lt;p&gt;When Kim Kardashian &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; about having had a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/keeping-up-with-advanced-mri-kim-kardashian-promotes-whole-body-scans-could-they-be-worth-the-hype-211676"&gt;full-body MRI&lt;/a&gt;, she enthused that the test can be "life saving", detecting diseases in the earliest stages before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Kardashian neglected to say was there's no evidence this expensive scan can bring benefits for &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;healthy people&lt;/a&gt;. She also didn't mention it can carry harms including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00679-4"&gt;unnecessary diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; and inappropriate treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post in mind, we wanted to explore what influencers are telling us about medical tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, we analyzed nearly 1,000 Instagram and TikTok posts about five popular medical tests which can all do more harm than good to healthy people, including the full-body  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the overwhelming majority of these posts were utterly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5 controversial tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the details of what we found, a bit about &lt;a href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2024/1/e56899"&gt;the five tests&lt;/a&gt; included in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these tests can be valuable to some, all five carry the risk of overdiagnosis for generally healthy people. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-warning-signs-of-overdiagnosis-110895"&gt;Overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is the diagnosis of a condition which would have never caused symptoms or problems. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, which can cause unnecessary side effects and stress for the person, and wasted resources for the health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/29-000-cancers-overdiagnosed-in-australia-in-a-single-year-127791"&gt;29,000 cancers a year are overdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; in Australia alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overdiagnosis is a global problem, and it's driven in part by healthy people having tests like these. Often, they're promoted under the guise of early screening, as a way to "take control" of your health. But most healthy people simply don't need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the five tests we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;full-body MRI scan&lt;/strong&gt; claims to test for up to 500 conditions, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Yet there is no proven benefit of the scan for healthy people, and a real risk of unnecessary treatment from "&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;false alarm&lt;/a&gt;" diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;"egg timer" test&lt;/strong&gt; (technically known as the AMH, or anti-mullarian hormone test) is often falsely promoted as a fertility test for healthy women. While it may be beneficial for women within a fertility clinic setting, it cannot reliably predict the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2656811"&gt;chance of a woman conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/3/327/6990969?login=true"&gt;menopause starting&lt;/a&gt;. However, low results can &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/0167482X.2018.1541980?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#abstract"&gt;increase fear and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to unnecessary and expensive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29719026/"&gt;fertility treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-cancer early detection blood tests&lt;/strong&gt; are being heavily marketed as the "holy grail of cancer detection", with claims they can screen for more than 50 cancers. In reality,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still a long way from finished. There's &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1706"&gt;no good evidence yet&lt;/a&gt; that the benefits will outweigh the harms of unnecessary cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gut microbiome test&lt;/strong&gt; of your stool promises "wellness" via early detection of many conditions, from flatulence to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, again &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/well/live/microbiome-test.html"&gt;without good evidence of benefit&lt;/a&gt;. There's also concern that test results can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2019-0122/html"&gt;wasted resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testosterone testing&lt;/strong&gt; in healthy men is not supported by any high-quality evidence, with concerns direct-to-consumer advertising &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2612615"&gt;leads men to get tested and take testosterone replacement therapy unnecessarily&lt;/a&gt;. Use of testosterone replacement therapy carries its own risk of potential harms with the long-term safety in relation to heart disease and mortality &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666756822000964?via%3Dihub"&gt;still largely unknown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with an international group of health researchers, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;we analyzed 982 posts&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the above tests from across Instagram and TikTok. The posts we looked at came from influencers and account holders with at least 1,000 followers, some with a few million followers. In total, the creators of the posts we included had close to 200 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even discounting the bots, that's a massive amount of influence (and likely doesn't reflect their actual reach to non-followers too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of posts were misleading, failing to even mention the possibility of harm arising from taking one of these tests. We found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87 percent of posts mentioned test benefits, while only 15 percent mentioned potential harms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts mentioned the risk of overdiagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts discussed any scientific evidence, while 34 percent of posts used personal stories to promote the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68 percent of influencers and account holders had financial interests in promoting the test (for example, a partnership, collaboration, sponsorship or selling for their own profit in some way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed medical doctors were slightly more balanced in their posts. They were more likely to mention the harms of the test, and less likely to have a strongly promotional tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all studies do, ours had some limitations. For example, we didn't analyze comments connected to posts. These may give further insights into the information being provided about these tests, and how social media users perceive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, our findings add to the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470931/"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing misleading medical information is widespread on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153582" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg" alt="Person being prepared for a scan in an MRI machine" class="wp-image-153582 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-blue-denim-jeans-lying-on-bed-f2aDTqfnqfE"&gt;National Cancer Institute/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have proposed a range of solutions including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-we-be-inoculated-against-climate-misinformation-yes-if-we-prebunk-rather-than-debunk-215815"&gt;pre-bunking strategies&lt;/a&gt;, which means proactively educating the public about common misinformation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, solutions like these often place responsibility on the individual. And with all the information on social media to navigate, that's a big ask, even for people with adequate health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's urgently needed is stronger regulation to prevent misleading information being created and shared in the first place. This is especially important given social media platforms including Instagram are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/meta-is-abandoning-fact-checking-this-doesnt-bode-well-for-the-fight-against-misinformation-246878"&gt;moving away from fact-checking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, remember that if information about medical tests promoted by influencers sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247362/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lead author, Australian National University PhD candidate in biological anthropology Adam Bode, defined romantic love as “a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual” – and one “that arose some time during the recent evolutionary history of humans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="384bc22e-19b0-4471-b866-500679329be9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Men say ‘I love you’ first – but are they really more romantic than women?","elementId":"384bc22e-19b0-4471-b866-500679329be9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/18/men-say-i-love-you-first-but-are-they-really-more-romantic-than-women"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bode said that definition was “not perfect” but was “the scientifically most useful and most precise”. He plans to update it to include the age of the onset of romantic love, to note that it “doesn’t have all its features until puberty”, and that it is associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the study, the romantic love stage can be measured through changes in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/feb/10/1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hormones and blood neurotransmitter levels&lt;/a&gt; and is thought to last up to two years, after which it transitions to “companionate love”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In some cases it persists longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bode said this was “the first paper to empirically show that we don’t all love the same”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That seems pretty obvious, but science just hasn’t shown it before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The researchers, including experts from the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia as well as ANU, used the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/15/love-story-australian-researchers-becoming-world-leaders-in-the-study-of-romantic-love" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Romantic Love Survey 2022&lt;/a&gt; of 1,556 people, the world’s largest dataset of people in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This longitudinal study across 33 countries selected 809 people aged 18 to 25, who self-reported being in love. And among them, Bode’s team identified four major “clusters”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild: &lt;/strong&gt;About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by “the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex”. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate: &lt;/strong&gt;About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intense: &lt;/strong&gt;This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libidinous: &lt;/strong&gt;About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as “relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex”. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Bode noted other interesting associations, including that libidinous lovers were also more likely to want to smoke cigarettes, travel and spend more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study measured the intensity of romantic love by the Passionate Love Scale (or PLS), a “robust measure of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of romantic love” used cross-culturally, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0140-1971%2886%2980043-4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;developed in 1986&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The research noted that obsessive thinking about a loved one has been recognised in theories about the understanding and mechanisms of romantic love. It cited previous research positing that obsessive thinking helps with bonding and faithfulness, that commitment plays a role in forming bonds, and that sex is a function of romantic love (the 2022 survey participants were told to define sex by “whatever they thought it meant”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The authors of the new study suggested it might “be fruitful” to further explore variables of sex, gender and sexual orientation, as well as the impact on mood of romantic love, and its effect on relationships over time. They also recommended future research focus on cultural or ethnic variations in the expression of romantic love, as well as the role of gender inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study noted that the survey at its heart was limited to young, English speaking adults, many of them from Weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Romantic love is under-researched given its importance in family and romantic relationship formation, its influence on culture, and its proposed universality and we want to help world researchers understand it,” Bode said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“These findings have implications for the evolution of romantic love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Humans may still be evolving in terms of how they express [it].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 23:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbXBLbXA2NUlXaHBUSW4xVkVOclNmM3F3RUtQRkVKdlQxVTJtbkpxWXRxRzZUTDQ3azR2THFfSFlSZ0FWbk1FOUdjcFMyV255V1ZseUtGcS0wb1ExXzFObjl6aWRaYVBKWWxQamxndklPNklLQ3U4MklWTlV1S0t3UGZRcjdxY3dEZ3ZjTzdGbzRkRmhsRUlmNm1fWDZzeGRhOVFnY3E3R2hHV2RWdlVHR2Y4VDEzUHQ4YnJTOGVMZw</guid></item><item><title>Short-Term Junk Food Diet Reduces Brain’s Insulin Sensitivity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE43RmJaNC1nMzlMWXBhRERQUkZkY2swNm1CUWhuMGVCSjFGWnpieWZWVTg2cDhKQjZnU1gycGdjQjEzRUJyVHlTVVJJLWdONTBPX0lkVTk1QlhUTEE5RUtzeXlKRWNFdXhWTjhLVzRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that consuming high-calorie, highly processed foods for just five days can reduce the brain’s sensitivity to insulin, a key factor in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that even in healthy individuals, short-term unhealthy eating altered brain function, mimicking effects seen in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sing MRI scans, they observed that reduced insulin sensitivity persisted even a week after returning to a normal diet. These findings suggest that the brain adapts rapidly to dietary changes, potentially contributing to long-term weight gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Just five days of a high-calorie diet reduced brain insulin sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulin resistance in the brain persisted even after resuming a normal diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; This effect mirrors insulin resistance seen in people with obesity and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of obese persons has grown significantly in recent decades, which presents significant difficulties for those who are impacted, healthcare systems, and those who provide treatment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone insulin plays a key role in the development of obesity. Up until recently, there have been numerous signs indicating insulin causes neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, especially in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108002"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the University Hospital of Tübingen, the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), and Helmholtz Munich offers intriguing new insights into the origins of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as the brain’s function as a critical control center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obesity has only been officially recognized as a disease in Germany since 2020, despite the fact that it has long been known to cause a number of illnesses, including diabetes, heart attacks, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has already declared obesity to be an epidemic, affecting over one billion individuals globally and almost 16 million in Germany alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A body mass index of 30 or more is considered obese, and a poor diet and insufficient exercise are frequently cited as the causes of this chronic illness. However, the mechanisms in the body that lead to obesity and cause the disease are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Obesity and the role of insulin in the brain &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. What specific functions does insulin perform in the brain, and how does it affect individuals of normal weight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, Prof. Dr. Stephanie Kullmann and her colleagues at the Tübingen University Hospital for Diabetology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology found the answer to this query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate for the first time that even a brief consumption of highly processed, unhealthy foods (such as chocolate bars and potato chips) causes a significant alteration in the brain of healthy individuals, which may be the initial cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes,” says Prof. Kullmann, the study’s leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a healthy state, insulin has an appetite-suppressing effect in the brain. However, in people with obesity in particular, insulin no longer regulates eating behavior properly, resulting in insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, in our healthy study participants, the brain shows a similar decrease in sensitivity to insulin after a short-term high calorie intake as in people with obesity,” says Ms. Kullmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This effect can even be observed one week after returning to a balanced diet,” she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is also deputy head of the Metabolic Neuroimaging department at the DZD partner Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of Helmholtz Munich at the University of Tübingen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Focus on the brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Dr. Andreas Birkenfeld, Medical Director of Internal Medicine IV, Director of the IDM and DZD Board Member, and the study’s final author, concludes, “We assume that the brain’s insulin response adapts to short-term changes in diet before any weight gain occurs and thus promotes the development of obesity and other secondary diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urges more research on how the brain contributes to the development of obesity and other metabolic illnesses in light of the current findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Short period with far-reaching effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;29 male volunteers of average weight participated in the study and were split into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five days in a row, the first group had to supplement their regular diet with 1500 kcal from highly processed, high-calorie snacks. The extra calories were not consumed by the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups underwent two separate examinations following an initial evaluation. One examination was conducted immediately following the five-day period, and another was conducted seven days after the first group had resumed their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the liver’s fat content and the brain’s insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the fat content of the liver of the first group increase significantly after five days of increased calorie intake. Surprisingly, the significantly lower insulin sensitivity in the brain compared to the control group also persisted one week after returning to a normal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect had previously only been observed in obese people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8afbdbabdaa98bca2bcf5bdaef6bcbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katrin Weber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzd-ev.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katrin Weber – DZD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01226-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephanie Kullmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain insulin responsiveness is linked to long-term weight gain and unhealthy body fat distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that short-term overeating with calorie-rich sweet and fatty foods triggers liver fat accumulation and disrupted brain insulin action that outlasted the time-frame of its consumption in healthy weight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, brain response to insulin can adapt to short-term changes in diet before weight gain and may facilitate the development of obesity and associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At least 60 people have died and more than 1,000 have been sickened in Congo’s Équateur Province by the illness, which is characterized by “fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea,” according to the latest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-deepens-investigation-cluster-illness-and-community-deaths-equateur?country=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo&amp;amp;name=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;W.H.O. report&lt;/a&gt; issued on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At a news conference in London on Friday, Dr. Michael Ryan, director of emergencies for the W.HO., said the illnesses were most likely caused by poisoning, contradicting a theory proposed on Thursday by experts at the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention who speculated malaria was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Based on onset of symptomatology to death,” Dr. Ryan said, “it looks and appears very much more like a toxic type event, either from a biologic perspective like a meningitis or from a chemical exposure.” He added that there was “a very strong level of suspicion,” that the poisoning was related to “a water source.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Investigators determined the initial outbreak began in the northwestern village of Boloko before spreading to nearby Danda village, the W.H.O. said.

But the day before her surgery, she received a shocking call from her doctor: A routine screening had revealed a malignant tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Two thousand things were going through my mind,” said Kaufman, an executive coach and the author of “Crushing the Cancer Curveball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She couldn’t form a coherent thought beyond: What should I do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A diagnosis of a serious illness can be overwhelming, whether it’s happening to you or someone you love. So I asked Kaufman and other experts about what to do immediately after hearing bad news — and in the weeks to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-21960cf5"&gt;Focus on right now.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Everyone responds differently to a distressing diagnosis; there is no right or wrong way to feel, said Stephanie Alonso, an outpatient oncology social worker at UChicago Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Don’t feel pressure to be positive, or to be a “fighter,” Kaufman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Instead, remind yourself that you do not have to make every decision at once, said Alison Snow, senior director of oncology social work at Mount Sinai in New York. Ask yourself: What do I need to get through the next hour? What do I need to get through this day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Writing down your thoughts can be therapeutic “and stop them from spiraling,” Dr. Snow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’re being treated at a hospital, ask if they have a social worker on staff who can share resources to help you cope with the emotional, financial and logistical needs that may arise, Alonso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump passed it on to Kennedy, who as HHS secretary not only has the word “health” in his title but also oversees agencies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy confirmed that the federal government was “following” and “watching” the situation, and added that there already had been two fatalities plus another 20 people hospitalized for what he said was “quarantine.” He went on to say that measles outbreaks were “not unusual,” &lt;/span&gt;noting that the U.S. had 16 outbreaks last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1894806176954753125" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="soliloquy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1894806176954753125" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;soliloquy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lasted less than 60 seconds ― which, as it turns out, was more than enough time to get &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="multiple things wrong" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;multiple things wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The 20 people in the hospital at the time weren’t there for quarantine, local health officials made clear afterward. They were there because they were having severe symptoms, which in many cases meant children struggling to breathe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kennedy spoke, there had been just one death, not two ― which was welcome news, to be sure, although the one death was a child. And while it’s true the U.S. had multiple outbreaks last year, that’s not really relevant context, because the CDC considers any cluster of at least three cases an “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="outbreak" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, Texas officials were reporting &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="146 documented cases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;146 documented cases&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 90 of them in Gaines County where the outbreak started. That number is sure to keep going up, and probably not just in Texas.

Firsthand knowledge of those dangers is one reason the public not only accepted vaccines but embraced them ― something else Edwards said she saw firsthand as a researcher in the 1970s and 1980s working on the Hib (&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Haemophilus influenzae type B" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="22"&gt;Haemophilus influenzae type B&lt;/a&gt;) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, she said, parents eagerly signed up their kids for trial studies because they knew the disease could lead to hearing loss, brain damage and death. And now? Vaccination, she says, has become a victim of its own success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have such a great product that people have just forgotten the diseases,” Edwards said. “And that is a big problem, because if people don’t understand the diseases that you’re trying to protect against, they really don’t dread them, or they don’t fear them, and they don’t really worry about them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the effects in polling, which has documented falling enthusiasm for vaccines over the last 25 years, with a particularly dramatic drop since COVID-19. (That’s also when attitudes about vaccines developed a sharp partisan divide, with Republican voters becoming far more skeptical than their Democratic counterparts). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, vaccination rates have fallen too. And it is in those communities where vaccination rates have fallen most dramatically that the measles, one of the most easily communicable diseases on the planet, keeps finding a foothold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“If people don't understand the diseases that you're trying to protect against, they really don't dread them, or they don't fear them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Kathryn Edwards, Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gaines County is one of those places.

This is like playing roulette with your child’s health.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent reports suggest that many parents are now rushing to get their kids vaccinated, to protect their children from what they now realize is such a real and serious threat. And that makes sense, given that the vast majority of parents really do want what is best for their kids. Those holding back on vaccines are doing so because they genuinely believe all of the misinformation in circulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;State and local officials have been doing their best to combat those myths, making a loud, consistent case for vaccination.

&lt;p&gt;Talk about a heavy dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the bulk of news coverage is focused on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/studies-show-ozempic-can-lower-risk-of-depression/"&gt;GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; that cause weight loss, licensed pharmacist &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/your.fav.pharmacist?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&amp;amp;ltsid=85fd47af-8fa3-4c9a-a002-d9eba061f219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes&lt;/a&gt; has spotlighted six medications “that’ll low-key or high-key make you fat or make you gain weight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surprising is an over-the-counter drug that’s incredibly popular for allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes says six medications are notorious for causing weight gain. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;highwaystarz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Benadryl&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Histamine, a chemical in our immune system involved in allergic response, also decreases appetite.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, according to the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/blog/antihistamines-and-weight-gain-obesity-medicine-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;, “it makes sense an antihistamine would have the opposite effect” and can “interfere with the ‘I’m full’ signal … and lead to overeating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Post, Forbes notes that first-generation antihistamines like Benadryl and cyproheptadine — which is also used as an appetite stimulant — can cause weight gain, particularly with long-term or continued usage.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Paroxetine (Paxil)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Paroxetine (Paxil), an antidepressant, is one of the more sedating SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) used for depression, anxiety/OCD, etc.,” said Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SSRIs increase levels of the “feel-good” chemical serotonin in the brain, and Forbes calls Paxil one of the worst offenders when it comes to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes’s insights on the relationship between antidepressants and weight gain come amid &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/antidepressant-prescriptions-increasing-young-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;growing antidepressant use&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young adults and teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that about 14% of US adults take an antidepressant. The Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute (HPHCI) notes that people often stop using the drug if they experience weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several psychiatrists in major New York hospitals told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2002/10/20/darker-side-to-the-911-wonder-pill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; they avoid prescribing Paxil as it causes more weight gain and sexual dysfunction than similar drugs — and has the worst withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;doucefleur – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Mirtazepine&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. Those with major depressive disorder may be prescribed higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We specifically try to avoid this in patients who are overweight,” explained Forbes. She noted that the same medicine is given to animals as an appetite stimulant to increase body weight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Kocsis, a professor and psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, previously told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/25/antidepressants-linked-to-the-obesity-epidemic-study/"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; that Remeron (Mirtazapine) “is known to cause weight gain frequently because its anti-histaminic effect makes users sluggish.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@your.fav.pharmacist/video/7287798908095368479" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;related TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Forbes recommends trazodone as a better, less appetite-amplifying substitute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics can pump up the plump. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tiktok/@your.fav.pharmacist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Second-generation antipsychotics&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459150/#:~:text=Neuroleptics%2C%20also%20known%20as%20antipsychotic,generation%20or%20%22atypical%22%20antipsychotics." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Antipsychotics&lt;/a&gt;, also known as neuroleptics, are used to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. These meds are categorized into two classes — first-generation or “typical” antipsychotics and second-generation or “atypical” antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics, especially Zyprexa and Seroquel, can pump up the plump. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The weight gain over a year can be massive, up to 30 to 50 pounds for some patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotics affect neuropeptides, the signaling molecules associated with appetite control and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the antipsychotic drug class, Forbes notes that weight gain is linked to antihistamine activity and serotonin 2C antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seven different types of serotonin receptors,” she said. “Specifically, 2C is where we get that side effect, the antagonism or blockade of that receptor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Dronabinol&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dronabinol is a synthetic THC used to treat and stimulate appetite in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;address anorexia and weight loss in adult HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Insulin &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insulin pushes glucose into cells vs. the bloodstream,” Forbes expounds. “These are not to be confused with meds like Ozempic/Mounjaro/Trulicity, etc., which are not insulins but also injected and refrigerated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insulin works by aiding the cellular absorption of glucose. However, when the cells absorb too much glucose, the body converts it into fat, leading to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Department of Health and Human Services is concerned by measles cases in other states, including Texas and New Mexico. But Utahns, especially those who are vaccinated, do not need to worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amelia Salmanson, the department's preventable disease manager, said it is working on preparing right now — making sure notification systems are in place, working with local public health departments, and reminding medical professionals to be alert and consider measles for patients with a fever and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the amount of recent cases, and how quickly cases are spreading, is concerning — especially with a child's &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51262404/a-texas-child-who-was-not-vaccinated-has-died-of-measles-a-first-for-the-us-in-a-decade" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;death in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and an outbreak in a neighboring state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we're really in kind of a preventative stage of asking people to get vaccinated and to monitor their vaccine status," Salmanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said anyone who is vaccinated has a "very, very low" risk of getting measles; the vaccine is about 97% effective with the two recommended doses. The health department does not recommend any steps after exposure to someone who has been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very good vaccine, and it's very safe," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmanson said the health department will notify people as soon as there is a case in Utah. Utah had one case in 2023 and three in 2017 — each initiated by someone traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmanson said the department is specifically encouraging vaccinations before traveling, both within and outside the United States. She said anyone who travels to an area with an outbreak, who isn't vaccinated, should be cautious of cold and flu symptoms followed by a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a serious disease, it does spread more than any other infectious disease, but really ... the vaccine is very good, and it is very effective," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the low risk of contracting measles in Utah, Salmanson still encourages staying home when you don't feel well. She said there are also multiple respiratory illnesses going around that people should avoid spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is a big message in general that we are trying to say ... if you're sick, stay home," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting three outbreaks so far in 2025, compared to 16 outbreaks throughout 2024. It also reported a total of 164 cases — which is pretty high when considering there were 285 cases reported by the CDC in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Texas reported 146 cases of measles this year, and New Mexico reported nine. The CDC also said cases have been reported this year in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the CDC reported a total of 1,274 cases — the most cases since 1992. In 2000, the United States declared measles was eliminated, almost four decades after the vaccine was licensed and one decade after a second dose was recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmanson said Utah's vaccination coverage overall is around 90%, but rates are lower in some health districts than others, including those in southwest Utah, central Utah and northeast Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah requires the measles vaccine before beginning kindergarten at a public school. Those who are not vaccinated are required to have an exception on file, so officials can identify those at risk for contracting measles if there has been exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department, said in a statement Friday that a high level of community immunity is essential to protect young infants and those who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is not just about you, but also about protecting the people around you," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, 95% of people in a community need to be immune to prevent a measles outbreak. Salt Lake County school immunization data shows 92.3% of kindergartners are up to date on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said adults born before 1957 generally do not need vaccination because they are likely immune after widespread infection before a vaccine. It suggested a second dose for adults vaccinated before 1968, and said adults vaccinated after are considered fully protected — although a second dose is recommended for students, health care workers or international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmanson said adults who may have missed the vaccine can check their vaccination status using methods on the &lt;a href="https://immunize.utah.gov/usiis-parents-individuals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;health department's website&lt;/a&gt; and can talk to their health provider about getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said measles begins like other illnesses, with general cold symptoms. A few days later, a rash will begin often starting at the hairline or forehead. According to the CDC, 32 or 20% of the measles cases this year have required hospitalization, with most of those hospitalizations being people younger than 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do suspect measles, Salmanson suggested calling ahead before going to a clinic because of how infectious it can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no at-home test, but doctors can do a blood test to determine immunity or infection — however, she said testing is just part of the assessment process. At least in areas not associated with an outbreak, diagnosing includes a look at vaccination status and tracing a person with symptoms to possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can review their individual school or school district's vaccination rates online through the Utah health department's &lt;a href="https://avrpublic.dhhs.utah.gov/imms_dashboard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Kennedy Jr., said the situation was “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We have measles outbreaks every year,” he added. Mr. Kennedy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-anti-vax.html" title=""&gt;has also said in the past&lt;/a&gt; that immunizations against measles and some other infectious diseases are unnecessary and risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Public health experts said that while it’s true we do have measles cases in the United States every year, the latest outbreak is concerning because of its size, because a child has died and because larger outbreaks like this are becoming more frequent as vaccination rates decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“While we certainly see measles cases from time to time, it’s a rarity that we see an unfolding outbreak of this scale,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. At least 164 people have been sickened with measles so far this year. That is more than half the number of cases in all of 2024, and higher than the 59 cases documented in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-3cbb8137"&gt;How ‘normal’ are measles outbreaks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, which was considered a landmark public health achievement made possible by the vaccine. Since then, there have been cases every year — typically originating with somebody who traveled abroad to a destination where measles is more common, and brought the virus back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Cook, along with Lubbock's director of public health, Katherine Wells, said they see no end in sight for the outbreak, which now spans nine counties in Texas, many of which have low vaccination rates. "This outbreak is going to continue to grow," Wells said, declining to forecast how high the final case count could go after a reporter raised the possibility of several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 116 of the 146 cases are under the age of 18, with 46 being between the ages of 0 and 4. Only five of the 146 were vaccinated with at least one dose of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Wells reported that the outbreak has seemed to sway some vaccine-hesitant parents to get their children vaccinated. Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. "Which is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in the outbreak, which erupted in late January, messaging about the disease and the importance of vaccination has exclusively come from state and local authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;a brief statement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday, which was not sent through the agency's press distribution list. It did, however, note that "vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a cabinet meeting Wednesday, US Health Secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, offering a variety of inaccurate information. Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, falsely claiming that "it's not unusual." But, this is an unusual year for measles in the US. As epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted on Bluesky, the number of US measles cases this year has already &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h"&gt;surpassed the total case counts from eight of the previous 15 years&lt;/a&gt;. And it is only February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test positivity at clinical labs is trending downward but is still high, at 24.5%. Outpatient visits for flulike illness also declined but, at 5.8%, are still well above the national baseline for the 13th straight week. States still in the very high range include Michigan, Ohio, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative hospitalization rate is at its highest level since the 2010-11 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that 21,000 people have died from flu this season, and the pace of flu deaths in the latest reporting week outpaced those for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve more pediatric flu deaths were reported, putting the season's total at 98. All were linked to influenza A. Of 11 subtyped strains, 8 were the 2009 H1N1 virus, 2 were H3N2, and 1 involved a coinfection with both strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;COVID continues to drop amid shifting variant landscape&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt;, emergency department (ED) visits are low with a continuing decline, and test positivity remains stable, at 4.3%, the CDC said. Wastewater levels are at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html"&gt;moderate range&lt;/a&gt;, and though detections are declining for all regions, they are highest in the Midwest, followed by the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;variant tracking update&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said that, over the past 2 weeks the LP.8.1 Omicron subvariant, at 42% of detections, has now edged above the XEC subvariant, which now makes up 31% of detections. LP.8.1 is a descendant of KP.1.1.3, which is part of the JN.1 lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the

years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave last week&lt;/a&gt;, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0

two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster," Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0

year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the

fezwLZ"&gt;The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave last week&lt;/a&gt;, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions," Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa

It can potentially lead to serious health consequences, including death. It can spread when an infected person breaths, coughs or sneezes or by touching an infected surface, according to&lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt; John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;said, you can get measles just by being in a room where the infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest number of cases and the&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt; first death from the disease since 2015&lt;/a&gt; — an unvaccinated child — have occurred in rural west Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the uptick in cases is caused by an overall &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-27/as-measles-cases-mount-in-the-us-whats-the-situation-worldwide"&gt;decline in measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious that at least 95% of a community needs to be immunized to prevent it from spreading. In the U.S. most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergarten-age children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers and airport staff who were at Terminal B — which serves flights for Air China, Air France, All Nippon Airways, British Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways, among others — on Feb. 19 between 1 and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible exposure site includes specific seats on the Korean Airline flight. Potentially exposed passengers can expect to be contacted by their local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County Health Officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise that you confirm whether you’ve been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not had measles in the past and have not yet received the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease if you’ve been exposed, according to county public health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal where the infected traveler passed through you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or are unimmunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-would-it-take-for-signs-of-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;How long would it take for signs of symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;What are symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days. Health officials say the rash lasts between five and six days before fading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection can result in severe complications, including blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections, trouble breathing due to pneumonia and, in some cases, death, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults,” Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for complications to occur in children under 5 and adults over the age of 30, according to public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-the-measles" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against the measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 20:30:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNVlFfLU8wRmYycktVeVZUN0hoeWo4QmxiR2Z0azg2bXViR2FheW1TRkpxTDBpMmZuWGJrNldlc0lJOVo3emUwMUlWX2tIdXRZM29SWTR4U0UxdW9aSldKTGoxaVRnUnJnV1NYR2hnLWV0YU1Nc3laay1PV0Z3MUdMTzhwamdKc0U2c3BLZVlfVXFQUXU2U001ek9JR25vSXd5Y251elIyRkUtb3E1bGc2bnVUblRvR0pJVW9lZ0RJUWtwaVhGMjQtLTduWDBHWWl2MXdF</guid></item></channel></rss>
