They can be as simple as going up a flight of stairs or doing a lap around your office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B looked to test the efficiency of walking over different time intervals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their research, the team used volunteers who walked on a treadmill or climbed a short flight of stairs for different time periods ranging from 10 seconds to four minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that people who walked in short bursts used up to 60 percent more energy than those who took longer, slower walks, despite the walks covering the same distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the more energy you expend, the more you boost metabolism and the more calories you burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Micro-walks are defined as walking for 10 to 30 seconds at a time with breaks between your next walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers concluded that doing brief bursts of walking might boost your metabolism and help you burn more calories than taking longer, steady strolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, one in four adults does not get adequate physical activity. In the US, nearly half of Americans are overweight or obese and around 300,000 deaths are the result of physical inactivity and poor eating habits, according to estimates by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Micro-walks are particularly effective for sedentary individuals or those in recovery, offering an accessible way to reintroduce movement,' Dr Zulia Frost, co-founder and clinical director of Recharge Health, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://10best.usatoday.com/lifestyle/benefits-of-micro-walking/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting to exercise can seem overwhelming and even scary to some, but&lt;span&gt; micro-walks can start to set you on a path of renewed health and fitness without needing to commit to long workouts that take up a huge chunk of your day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's really about doing what you can,' dietitian Albert Matheny, a co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65498437/micro-walks-study-walking-health-weight-loss/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Women's Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're not a big walker and you think, "I don't want to walk five miles," then just do 30-second bursts. It's more attainable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there are numerous benefits to the short walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even a few minutes of walking after meals can aid digestion and help regulate blood sugar levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that short bursts of movement throughout the day contribute to calorie burn and improved metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sitting for long periods can cause stiffness, back pain, and decreased energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking a five-minute walking break every hour can improve circulation, boost concentration, and reduce fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a quick stroll can be a mood-lifter. Micro-walks have the ability to reduce stress hormones and enhance creativity, effectively boosting productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking - even in short intervals - also helps regulate blood pressure, manage weight, and improve cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14937193/scientists-reveal-number-daily-steps-prevent-dementia.html"&gt;a recent analysis of nearly 60 studies&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found just 7,000 steps, not the always-touted 10,000, in a day was enough to lower the risk of dementia, heart disease and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists compared the effects of 7,000 daily steps to 2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on health data from 160,000 people, those who walked 7,000 steps a day had a 25 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, America's number one killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, 7,000 daily steps led to a 38 percent drop in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who adhered to the measure were also less likely to suffer from depression than those who got just 2,000 steps in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, maybe we don't need to cart our fancy flagons around with us as much as we thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Neil Turner, kidney specialist at the University of Edinburgh, says as humans we existed for thousands of years without knowing what a pint or a litre was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I mean, mice don't need flashing water bottles telling them how much to drink - why do we?" he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Our bodies are set up to do things just right - we eat when we are hungry, we breathe when we need to breathe, and we drink when we are thirsty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Is it really that simple? According to Prof Turner, who has seen a lot of kidneys in his time, that rule applies to the vast majority of us. Those with specific conditions, like a kidney disorder, may have to drink more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says if our urine is dark, in the general healthy population, we shouldn't panic that we haven't drank enough - that is the kidney doing its job. It is reserving water in our body, he explains, and our body should tell us that we feel thirsty and then we will get a drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Linia Patel, a performance nutritionist, disagrees. We might drink different amounts, she says, due to factors like our size, how warm we are, whether we've been drinking alcohol, but she feels having a target of 1.5 to 2 litres is a good thing - especially for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I would definitely say from a women's health point of view, where I work, what I see is a lot of the symptoms [associated] with being dehydrated. It might be fatigue, constipation, brain fog, feeling hungry [or] cravings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She says that if the problem is related to hydration then it's "an easy one to get right, if you're consistent with it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Sleep (7-9 hours a night)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1064/live/7a1c3be0-6956-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Woman lying face down on a bed.

"As soon as we lower the limit then there's a risk people will think it's ok to sleep for less time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cat napping?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Unfortunately not," he says, "Our bodies have very different reactions to naps through the day, and eventually if we tried to make up the hours we were missing overnight by sleeping through the day, we would struggle to fall asleep at night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But all is not lost, nappers among us - there are studies that suggest a short snooze in the day can keep the brain youthful, and even compensate for poor or broken sleep the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Johal suggests that for those who struggle to get the recommended amount, try to target a few nights of good sleep a week, and just being "more aware that sleep is so important".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/160f/live/14a1cb90-6960-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Emily &amp;amp; Lucy Emily and Lucy - two women standing in a forested area, surrounded by trees.

While moderate strength training and physical activity is vital for maintaining muscle mass, she says, as well as resistance to injuries and supporting our immune systems, you have to adapt the recommendations to fit with your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise people," she says. "This phrase really does apply here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I have friends who do nothing - and that really does show, I say, 'You're walking like an 80-year-old!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But if you are doing one strength session a week and some moderate exercise then that is definitely a good thing, just try and do more if you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She uses an analogy of a highway - the more things we can do to stay healthy the wider the road, which, in turn means we can go off course sometimes without careering up a grassy verge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"All those benchmarks are interlinked - you can't just do one healthy thing and ignore the rest. Equally you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself to achieve them all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This attitude chimes with Emily and Lucy, who say they happily "chip away" at some of the health benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For example, we might do five minutes of meditation [which is] better than nothing, but we wouldn't stress about not hitting the recommended goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Mindfulness (10 mins a day)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4346/live/84e73450-6945-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A woman sitting cross-legged on a green sofa.

In some respects, could having these targets make life &lt;i id="more" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; stressful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Tiwari disagrees - it's less about the time spent and more about the awareness of mindfulness and bringing it to our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even brief pauses," she explains, "can still have a positive impact".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most experts I've spoken to agree that while benchmarks are useful, and simplicity is key, it's better not to fixate on a number.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Senior author, Prof Susan Davis, said while vasomotor symptoms (VMS) – such as hot flushes and night sweats – were already known to be typical of menopause, the study found moderate to severe VMS symptoms to be the most defining symptom of perimenopause, the time period leading up to the final menstrual period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a

email&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although other symptoms were commonly reported by perimenopausal women, including poor memory and low mood, analysis showed none differed in prevalence enough from pre-menopause to differentiate between menopausal stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found 37.3% of women in late perimenopause had moderately-to-severely bothersome hot flushes: meaning they were five times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Severe vaginal dryness was 2.5 times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT, also known as HRT) is effective for treating VMS due to menopause, but there are no specifically designed or approved interventions for these symptoms for perimenopausal women, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Treating perimenopause is not the same as treating post-menopause because women are still randomly ovulating, contraception needs to be considered, MHT can make bleeding heavier and progesterone worsens PMS, Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study also challenged the assumption that menstrual irregularity is the earliest sign of perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297

findings support a more symptom-based approach&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Davis said it is common for women to ask their GPs if their heavier periods and hot flushes are a sign of perimenopause, only for the doctor to respond: “If you’re still getting regular cycles, you can’t possibly be perimenopausal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But when the study compared pre-menopausal women with VMS whose periods were still regular but had changes – becoming lighter or heavier – they were the same as women who had VMS but who’d started experiencing changes in period cycle frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So we’re really saying ignoring hot flushes and night sweats is wrong,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Rakib Islam, also a study author, said defining perimenopause and menopause by menstrual cycle overlooks women with regular cycles and those who no longer menstruate, such as those who have had an endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, and users of hormonal contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings support a more symptom-based approach, enabling earlier recognition of perimenopause and more timely care,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Davis said it was “critical” that women were recruited to the study with no mention made of menopause, so the sample was not biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7d29c634-53f9-4005-b7a6-e3c586c4f681" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"

perimenopause, an area traditionally overlooked in menopause research,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“More than a third of research in medical treatments is done by pharmaceutical companies. They traditionally have excluded perimenopausal women from the research because the perimenopausal women are still producing their own hormones in a sometimes unpredictable way, and it didn’t fit with the study design that they wanted,” Hickey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hickey said the study’s main limitation was that it was a cross-sectional survey. So while it was helpful for knowing what symptoms women categorised to a particular stage might experience, “it doesn’t tell us how these things change as women go through menopause”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fae0a236-a446-475e-b0a6-e1a8d13ff22e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.EmbedBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="UnsafeEmbedBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"html":"&amp;lt;script src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;","alt":"signup","index":25,"isTracking":false,"isMainMedia":false,"source":"The Guardian","sourceDomain":"uploads.guim.co.uk"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxPdm4xUm5tLWZvTmpfSDlXVVRCUnFud2NqNFJFSTBnTUlYT0FpZzBraEh1a1BFS0hmcEZ6dlNraXJzc1lPdHFzUGtINEZwLTVNMXlVNWJneExFVzk0T3lnTVBNcTZacnhETkFRR3BPSlRPVnlGakw1R2pNSUdueEhuQWczZ0tLOWRmNjRwdzhwZWp6OEFpTThmQk9QZXV0Vk01MmEtblFzSDZwZFFGRGdDZkgwdXdQX3dFX2VBWjdEOV9Nc2RsZTZOR0w2UUpYSWFi</guid></item><item><title>随着弗吉尼亚州病例增加，您应该注意的皮疹- WTOP | The rash you should be on the lookout for as cases rise in Virginia - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNejliM0t3V3hOYVM3WTh5bXl2NFBGNWFJZzFBM2JnY2tYeGZmV2MtR01leVdnN3ZwcXF1R2QyTWV1ZDVRa3NFTmJ4LURVQmh0NnpDU3hYQ0oyQU1oZC1GVFpzcVA1RHkzMEw0aXR0MlBmaFNmcll5MW9WWVZrVkwtMkZVdHBsQ2s4RDVldmxDdGJUdFhuRS01OGxTTTg0QU5jdXZ3ag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;There has been an increase in the number of children in Fairfax County, Virginia, that are being diagnosed with Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;There has been an increase in the number of children in Fairfax County, Virginia, that are being diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/health/fairfax-health-district-sees-rise-in-reports-hand-foot-mouth-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a total of six cases in Fairfax County&lt;/a&gt;, five of those in the last two months, and health officials say it’s very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot of it right now,” said Tiffany Kimbrough, a pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It’s a common virus that we often see spread in the summer months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said it’s often seen in day care centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s spread through respiratory droplets, through drooling and contact with stools,” Kimbrough said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a rash on the hands and feet are a classic symptom, she said you can see it in other areas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The blisters can be also in the diaper region, on the back of the throat. It can be really painful when you’re trying to eat and drink,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recommended keeping you and your child as clean as possible with good hygiene routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really good hand washing is important, especially after contact with any of the drool, after diaper changes or contact with any of the blisters, especially after they’ve popped,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the disease isn’t deadly, Kimbrough said you have to make sure your child isn’t getting dehydrated since sores often also show up on the back of the throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should check that your child is “making at least one wet diaper every eight hours is really the biggest thing, so that we can make sure they’re staying on top of their fluids,” she said. “Avoid things that are acidic or that might burn the back of the throat, and go for our bland, more boring things, just to make sure that we’re staying on top of fluids is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no medication that treats HFMD, but over-the-counter aspirins can help relieve the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INDIANAPOLIS — Weight loss can be challenging, but every pound counts during that journey.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Goode is a registered nurse at Riley Hospital for Children with his own motivations for losing weight — an alarming meeting with his doctor.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He told me that I wasn't going to make it to 40 if I didn't make some sort of change, and that kind of kicked it into gear," Goode said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goode is 28 years old. In February 2023, he weighed 465 pounds. At the time, he had hypertension, sleep apnea and Type 2 diabetes. At the end of that year, he had bariatric surgery. He said he was supposed to lose 20 pounds before surgery — he lost 80.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the motivation and support of his mom, Riley co-workers, and his gym in Martinsville, Goode started to see progress. As he lost weight, he realized how much better he was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I take the stairs every day to get up to work here, and I'm not winded by the end of it," Goode said. "In fact, sometimes if I skip cardio in the morning, I will literally walk the stairs up and down three times just to make sure I get my cardio in."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest weight Goode reached was 176 pounds. As of July 2025, he weighed 205, a difference of 260 pounds since February 2023. He said his previous health conditions are gone. While he was always able to care for patients at Riley, he explained now he can do more for them and better interact with kids.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby Nation, day shift coordinator at the hospital's heart center, said Goode's weight loss journey inspired his co-workers to also live healthier lives. She explained how they encouraged him to never give up.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's participating with him or just sending him an encouraging text or just telling him here on the unit, 'Kevin, you look great. You're doing so well, just we're really proud of you.' Just any kind of motivation that we can give him," Nation said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goode will take his body transformation to the stage in October — thanks to some encouragement from a trainer at his gym. He will compete in a transformational bodybuilding competition, which is judged based on before-and-after photos, his story and 20% for his physique.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've already won, obviously, with shedding the weight off and changing my life and my lifestyle and everything I'm able to do now," Goode said. "But just trying to put it in that next person's mind that you can literally do whatever you set your mind to."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goode is getting his certified trainer license and will graduate in May to become a nurse practitioner. He said his main goal is to inspire others — considering where he was at and what it took to become confident on a bodybuilding stage.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak that sickened over 160 people in California and a handful of individuals in other states was caused by raw milk products from a single dairy farm, a new report explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak — described Thursday (July 24) in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MMWR), which is published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — took place between September 2023 and March 2024. The California Department of Public Health was first notified of the outbreak when nine people fell ill after consuming a specific brand of raw milk produced by the same dairy. This prompted an investigation by state and federal officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This outbreak is notable because it was "one of the largest foodborne outbreaks linked to raw milk in recent U.S. history," the report authors emphasized. Between 2009 and 2021, there have been 16 &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreaks tied to raw milk consumption and those were comparatively small, involving between two and 33 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, last year's outbreak was notable because it disproportionately affected young children, as the median age of those sickened was 7 years old, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Commercially distributed raw dairy products have the potential to cause large and widespread infectious disease outbreaks," the report writers cautioned. "Public health authorities should continue to raise awareness of the risks associated with consuming raw dairy products, especially by persons at increased risk for severe disease from enteric [intestinal] pathogens, including children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;, raw milk can contain a range of other disease-causing germs, including bird flu viruses, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listeria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/about/index.html" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/about/index.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That's because raw milk, also called unpasteurized milk, isn't heated to a high temperature to kill off those germs prior to being sold. Children under 5 years old, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems face particularly high risks from consuming raw milk products because the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/raw-milk.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/raw-milk.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;germs listed above can make them severely ill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/how-does-e-coli-get-into-food" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/how-does-e-coli-get-into-food"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does E. coli get into food?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wsq5inMWGrdcQREyUrjkjJ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wsq5inMWGrdcQREyUrjkjJ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak described in the report affected 171 people in total, including 159 confirmed and 12 probable cases. Most cases occurred in California, but there was one case each in New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the total cases, 67 occurred in children under 5, 40 were in children ages 5 to 12, and 13 were in teens under 18. That means about 70% of the total cases affected kids and teens. Out of 22 known cases that required hospitalization, 18 were in children under 18. No deaths were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The distribution of the cases was consistent with a continuous common source outbreak," the report authors wrote. This was also confirmed by genetic analyses of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;samples gathered from the affected patients and found in products from the dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the source of infection in the four cases outside California is not 100% certain. Raw milk products intended for human consumption are not allowed to be sold across state lines, per federal law. However, "federal law does not prohibit the interstate sale of raw milk intended for pet consumption or interstate sale of raw cheese aged for ≥60 days," the report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, it's possible that these four cases involved local sales of products that were originally produced in California — namely, raw cheese or raw milk marketed for pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other possible explanations for the non-California outbreak cases are that patients could not recall or did not accurately report travel history or were infected through unrecognized secondary transmission," the authors speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMWR doesn't name the dairy implicated in the outbreak. But in 2024, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article296650424.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article296650424.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Fresno Bee reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that officials had linked the outbreak to Raw Farm LLC, based in Fresno County, and that this led to a recall of some of the company's products and inspections of its facilities. Separately, the same company also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-039.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-039.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;detected bird flu in some of its products in late 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, prompting &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-044.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-044.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;another recall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Science contacted Raw Farm prior to publication, but the company declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this month, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/July-2025-Press-Releases/7-22-2025-Public-Health-Alerts-Residents-to-Immediately-Discard-The-Family-Cow-Brand-Raw-Milk-and-Raw-Milk-Cheese-Following-Detection-of-Salmonella" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/News-Articles/Allegheny-County-Press-Releases/July-2025-Press-Releases/7-22-2025-Public-Health-Alerts-Residents-to-Immediately-Discard-The-Family-Cow-Brand-Raw-Milk-and-Raw-Milk-Cheese-Following-Detection-of-Salmonella" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Allegheny County Health Department in Pennsylvania is urging people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to discard all Family Cow brand raw milk products after locals became sick with &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;infections after consuming the products.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After looking at the evidence, the research team concluded that there is &lt;span&gt;a positive correlation between erectile function and muscle health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They explained: 'Maintaining skeletal muscle with nutrition and physical activity improves erectile and overall health outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Therapies that target sexual function and muscle health simultaneously (eg, testosterone and L-carnitine) may further benefit sexual function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Future studies are warranted to strengthen and elucidate this relationship and to follow the longitudinal outcomes of these therapies on sexual health.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between erectile dysfunction and exercise isn't new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We published a paper about a year and a half ago, showing that exercise significantly reverses erectile dysfunction,' study co-author Dr Mohit Khera &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a65489108/strength-training-erectile-dysfunction/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Men's Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise can play a significant role in improving erectile dysfunction by positively impacting several key areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular physical activity can improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, manage weight, and address psychological factors, all of which contribute to erectile function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Khera added: 'While higher testosterone levels from strength training may play a minor role, the primary benefits are derived from improved vascular health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His past research found that &lt;span&gt;160 minutes of exercise a week, including strength training, significantly improved erectile function in men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Notably, those with the most severe erectile dysfunction experienced the greatest improvements through regular exercise,' he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with working out, the researchers found diet can also play a role in erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found L-carnitine, an amino acid found in red meat, poultry, and fish, may help work as a remedy for ED, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erectile dysfunction is very common and often affects men over 40 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, more than 3.5 million prescriptions for sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra) were filled in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most men struggle to get or keep an erection at some point. This can be caused by stress, fatigue or drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if it is a frequent occurrence, it may be a result of high blood pressure or cholesterol, diabetes, depression or anxiety and hormones problems, and is something that can be discussed with a healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs on the market for ED include Viagra, which is part of a drug class called PDE5 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They work by blocking an enzyme that restricts blood flow to the penis, by blocking it, the normal function can resume and the penis can be become erect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erectile dysfunction is very common and often affects men over 40 years old.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLYMOUTH, Minn. — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: The above video originally aired on August 29, 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/local/fatal-west-nile-virus-cases-reported-wisconsin-minnesota-experiences-milder-season/89-76a2be94-1fe3-4c4b-b8a6-26744c2f14a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile&lt;/a&gt; virus activity is surging in the Twin Cities metro area this summer, according to the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District (MMCD), with mosquito trap data showing early-season positivity rates at unusually high levels. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent surveillance efforts, MMCD scientists noted a sharp increase in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes — the primary species responsible for transmitting West Nile virus (WNV) to humans in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The number of cattail mosquitoes and floodwater mosquitoes are both down. The number of Culex tarsalis, however, are way up. Up both this last week and this year," said Dr. Scott Larson, MMCD entomologist. "There were a couple traps with over 100 in each and that really is atypical."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in Culex tarsalis, also known as the Western Encephalitis Mosquito, has been accompanied by a concerning rise in WNV detections. Dr. Jordan Mandli, MMCD vector ecologist, reported that last week alone, the lab processed 187 mosquito pools. Of the 133 pools tested, 34 were positive for West Nile virus — a positivity rate of more than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This surge has unfortunately been accompanied by a notable increase in WNV detections," Mandli said in the release. "This is one of the highest positivity rates we have ever seen in July and is more typical with late August when the mosquito populations are winding down."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus has now been detected in every county in the state, MMCD reports.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health has confirmed the state's first human case of West Nile virus in 2025. The case was reported in Dakota County and has been submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024, Minnesota recorded 35 human cases of the virus, according to MMCD. Health officials say about 80% of people infected won't know they have it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging residents to take precautions to prevent mosquito-borne illness. Recommendations include wearing insect repellent, eliminating standing water, and avoiding outdoor activity during peak mosquito hours — around sunrise and sunset.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

A new set of experiments from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5684/your-skin-buckles-as-you-age-and-thats-why-wrinkles-form" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Binghamton University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows that wrinkles form when the living fabric of your skin starts behaving like a stretched piece of 'silly putty'. Using strips of real human skin from volunteers aged 16 to 91, biomedical engineer Guy German and colleagues discovered that, as the years add up, skin no longer stretches and shrinks evenly. Instead, it pulls harder side-to-side while staying under a quiet, constant tension even at rest. When that sideways pull reaches a tipping point, the outer layer buckles and the familiar lines appear. The work, published July 2025 in the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, offers the first direct proof that pure physics drives wrinkle formation, while age-related loss of collagen and UV damage merely speed the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skin physics: Why uneven stretch creates permanent creases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;German’s team placed each skin sample in a low-force tensometer and watched how it behaved under gentle strain. Youthful skin returned smoothly to shape. Older skin shrank more in the direction opposite the pull, building internal stress until the surface finally folded. The group likens the effect to a thin film that crumples when one side contracts faster than the other, a phenomenon engineers call buckling. Their measurements confirm earlier computer models but replace theory with hard numbers on living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to reduce wrinkles on face: 7 tips to deal with skin ageing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sunlight accelerates the same mechanical failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronological ageing is not the only path to buckling. Ultraviolet rays break down collagen and elastin, the proteins that give dermal layers bounce and load-bearing strength. German notes that a lifetime outdoors ages skin “even if you are still young on paper.” Photo-damaged tissue reaches the critical buckling threshold sooner, explaining why farmers and sailors often show deep furrows well before office workers of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beyond collagen creams: New targets for anti-wrinkle care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cosmetic products promise to “boost collagen” or “lock in moisture.” The Binghamton data suggest future treatments may instead focus on rebalancing the internal stresses that build up in ageing skin. Materials scientists already test micro-mesh patches that redistribute lateral tension, while pharmaceutical labs explore peptides that adjust how dermal cells align their fibres. By attacking the physics, not just the chemistry, researchers hope to delay the buckling event itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical steps that still matter right now&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists emphasise that the new study does not erase proven basics. Sunscreen blocks photo-ageing, retinoids boost collagen repair, and a protein-rich diet supplies raw material for resilient dermis. Gentle facial exercises can preserve balanced tension across muscle groups, potentially reducing the uneven pull highlighted in the Binghamton tests. Adequate sleep and hydration keep the extracellular matrix pliable, again lowering mechanical stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 19:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxQbkR5Tk1wNXZCa2NOeVNHQU9faWw1Tzc3U2VkRzJZVkRTZ3oxQ1NOXzdZSTg5X3d2bUhKNHctQ01ucWZOMjRkZG5fTVlOcDYwU3ljUVNFYW5HQzdUd3cwUVNUYmptVWVUNnBzUmtRYUxKRHg1RlRjaE82TGxiSm9MUHFCWWprazlFTklKUDJQZmgxV0tiWGhjWmI0OXlISjFYdlFodWg1YTBjYXRmODV5NnpGOXV3QVo2Mk5HVGZ3UzQ0YklHZHNhNi1PenU1djFYc2tkQTRLWkx4WGxEWDFpUGloTQ</guid></item><item><title>女子声称她从美甲沙龙感染了生殖器疱疹病毒...她犯了可怕的错误-每日邮报 | Woman claims she contracted genital herpes virus from a nail salon... the dire mistake she made - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNVDN1RHFHS2dGQWFuQUFOQ09QMXZUb2xoUk5rV2dnU0hHeDhPR0Q2Q0RYYUpUcHVlVEYyZjhOdG9JNVVudmI3SHhsYzZ1Q3U2a3BFSVZwRk03U1J6MkN4ekZLbXNHWjZGWDhxN0txbnJaVWpRdVBHNks1eDI1UlhQWjJOT3dDY2xqWEZmaV9MdzFQYkZyaUEtWjNIOFYybjd40gGmAUFVX3lxTE5UT0pZWC0wd0R0N1Z1NlEtUy15MksyOGc0RVl0b1czOVBfblNHQTV1NW96cVRlOEktbnhDa3k5aEhWdTFhc3VxMDE5YlY1SWtWV2ZqbVlNM0J3OXJnX290RklneGdLNXJodEh4QjExZnFzZ3dwa3FEejhEVmlfOTZBTS15NFNTRmR6VnBOcFNuTUw4THdRMjZvRy1rYk8xZm96enFiYUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 23-year-old woman has sued a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/portland/index.html" id="mol-f3d9ec70-6979-11f0-bbff-afffa5328c81"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; nail salon after she claims a manicure left her with a virus that causes a sexually transmitted infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous woman said she visited PDX Nails near Portland, Oregon, for an acrylic nail manicure on June 1, 2023, according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/07/portland-customer-who-claimed-she-got-genital-herpes-virus-at-nail-salon-settles-lawsuit.html"&gt;The Oregonian/Oregon Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what was meant to be simple beauty service, typically priced between $58 to $70, allegedly resulted in the contraction of the STI herpes virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hours later, the woman noticed swelling on her right index finger and began to feel ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to her complaint, four days later, she developed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668173/Glenn-Morris-pedicure-left-leg-amputation.html"&gt;painful blisters on her fingers &lt;/a&gt;and visited a local urgent care clinic, according to her complaint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeing the state of her fingers, doctors swabbed her sores and sent samples from her blisters for testing to a lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that she had developed an herpetic whitlow infection - a finger infection caused by the herpes simplex virus - a common virus that affects about three out of every 100,000 people in the US annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are multiple strains, including HSV-1, which causes oral herpes and cold cores , and HSV-2, which causes genital herpes. It is unclear which strain the woman was diagnosed with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically contracted through infected saliva and genital fluids, the herpetic whitlow infection can also &lt;span&gt;be transmitted through contaminated objects such as shared nail tools or medical equipment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure flare ups resulting in open sores and blisters may occur. Treatment plans are usually focused on dealing with symptoms and preventing the spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 23-year-old woman has sued a Portland nail salon after she claims a treatment left her with a herpetic whitlow infection (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to The Oregonian/&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-50707c30-6973-11f0-82ee-91d45b155eb9" class=""&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; Live, the plaintiff claims in her lawsuit that the nail technician did not wear gloves during the service and &lt;span&gt;stored her manicure tools in an Altoids mints tin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also states that did not suffer from the condition in any capacity before receiving the manicure at the salon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A herpetic whitlow infection is typically caused by the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) which also causes cold sores or herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which can cause genital herpes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus can be transmitted through contact with an active herpes lesion, like a cold sore or through contact with infected saliva or genital secretions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The contagious infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can cause painful blisters, swelling, and redness, often on the fingertip or around the nail bed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, it can cause a fever and swollen lymph nodes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The early stages of the infection include pain and a tingling sensation on your finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within days, blisters form near your fingernail, which makes skin to be tender and sensitive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the infection progresses, a crust will form as it continues drying and healing. Most cases of herpetic whitlow affect one finger but it can spread to other fingers too depending on the severity of the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A doctor can usually diagnose herpetic whitlow based on the appearance of the lesions and the patient's symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The woman claims that the nail technician stored her manicure tools in an Altoids mints tin (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To confirm the diagnosis, experts may also test a sample of parts of the skin that have been affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A herpetic whitlow infection usually resolves on its own but may require an antiviral prescription to help the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir can help shorten the duration and severity of the infection, especially when started early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compresses and bandages on the fingers can also help prevent a secondary infection from the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while a typical herpetic whitlow infection lasts about two weeks, the 23-year-old claims hers has lasted years in continuation as the virus has flared up multiple times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to the infection's contagious nature, as well as the pain her in hands, the woman said she has been forced to repeatedly bandage her fingers to prevent the virus from spreading to others while she is out in public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A herpetic whitlow infection usually resolves on its own but may require an antiviral prescription to help the process (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told The Oregonian/Oregon Live: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'The flare-ups can be super, super painful. It's always on my mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People have asked "What happened to your finger?" I don't want to tell them what it really is because it's really embarrassing.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the lawsuit, she was seeking $1.75 million from the salon claiming negligence and unlawful trade practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to The Oregonian/Oregon Live, the patient and salon have now reached a confidential settlement with the business &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Details of the settlement have not been revealed.

Here's The Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much sleep do we need? And what can sleeping a lot really tell us about our health? Let's unpack the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep is essential for our health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with nutrition and physical activity, sleep is an essential pillar of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2023.02.005"&gt;physiological processes&lt;/a&gt; occur that allow our bodies to function effectively when we are awake. These include processes involved in muscle recovery, memory consolidation and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need"&gt;Sleep Health Foundation&lt;/a&gt; – Australia's leading not-for-profit organization that provides evidence-based information on sleep health – recommends adults get seven to nine hours of sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-some-people-need-less-sleep-than-others-a-gene-variation-could-have-something-to-do-with-it-256342"&gt;short sleepers&lt;/a&gt; and can function well with less than seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for most of us, sleeping less than seven hours will have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S134864"&gt;negative effects&lt;/a&gt;. These may be short term; for example, the day after a poor night's sleep you might have less energy, worse mood, feel more stressed and find it harder to concentrate at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, not getting enough good quality sleep is a &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.26918"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for health problems. It's linked to a higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.26918"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; – such as heart attacks and stroke – &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2011.00990.x"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt;, including type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="169091" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, poor &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30136-X"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="169091" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.10932"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/33/5/585/2454478"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's clear that not getting enough sleep is bad for us. But what about too much sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169104" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/syahdan-fadillah-wk1Nfxjr2C0-unsplash-e1753419129883.jpg" alt="Man sleeping on public transport" class="wp-image-169104 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169104" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What if your body just can't seem to get enough of sleep? (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-eyeglasses-wk1Nfxjr2C0"&gt;syahdan fadillah/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could too much sleep be bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01592-y"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reviewed the results of 79 other studies that followed people for at least one year and measured how sleep duration impacts the risk of poor health or dying to see if there was an overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found people who slept for short durations – less than seven hours a night – had a 14 percent higher risk of dying in the study period, compared to those who slept between seven and eight hours. This is not surprising given the established health risks of poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also found those who slept a lot – which they defined as more than nine hours a night – had a greater risk of dying: 34 percent higher than people who slept seven to eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports similar research from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.118.008552"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, which combined results from 74 previous studies that followed the sleep and health of participants across time, ranging from one to 30 years. It found sleeping more than nine hours was associated with a 14 percent increased risk of dying in the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also shown sleeping too long (meaning more than required for your age) is linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S163071"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; such as depression, chronic pain, weight gain and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may sound alarming. But it's crucial to remember these studies have only found a link between sleeping too long and poor health – this doesn't mean sleeping too long is the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of health problems or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what's the link?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors may influence the relationship between sleeping a lot and having poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18945686/"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; for people with chronic health problems to consistently sleep for long periods. Their bodies may need additional rest to support recovery, or they may spend more time in bed due to symptoms or medication side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with chronic health problems may also not be getting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.10.028"&gt;high quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and may stay in bed for longer to try and get some extra sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we know &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18945686/"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for poor health, such as smoking and being overweight, are also associated with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means people may be sleeping more &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of existing health problems or lifestyle behaviors, not that sleeping more is causing the poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, sleeping may be a symptom of poor health, not the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the ideal amount?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons some people sleep a little and others sleep a lot depend on &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need"&gt;individual differences&lt;/a&gt; – and we don't yet fully understand these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sleep needs can be related to age. &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/teenage-sleep"&gt;Teenagers&lt;/a&gt; often want to sleep more and may physically need to, with sleep recommendations for teens being slightly higher than adults at eight to ten hours. Teens may also go to bed and wake up later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults may want to spend more time in bed. However, unless they have a sleep disorder, the amount they need to sleep &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/ageing-sleep"&gt;will be the same&lt;/a&gt; as when they were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most adults will require seven to nine hours, so this is the healthy window to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just about how much sleep you get. Good quality sleep and a consistent bed time and wake time are just as important – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721823001663"&gt;if not more so&lt;/a&gt; – for your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2021.1876693"&gt;many Australian adults&lt;/a&gt; are not receiving the recommended amount of sleep, we should focus on how to make sure we get enough sleep, rather than worrying we are getting too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give yourself the best chance of a &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/sleep-hygiene-good-sleep-habits"&gt;good night's sleep&lt;/a&gt;, get sunlight and stay active during the day, and try to keep a regular sleep and wake time. In the hour before bed, avoid screens, do something relaxing, and make sure your sleep space is quiet, dark, and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice you are regularly sleeping much longer than usual, it could be your body's way of telling you something else is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with sleep or are concerned, speak with your GP.

                        &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img class="fr-fic fr-dib" src="https://accessglobal.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/uploads/froala_editor/images/How%20Much%20Vitamin%20D%20for%20ED.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ED the lack of ability to attain or keep an erection adequate for erotic performance, impacts hundreds of thousands of guys worldwide. While reasons of ED vary from psychological stress to cardiovascular ailment and diabetes, current lookup has explored the viable position of diet D in aiding erotic health. This article dives into how a good deal diet D can also be recommended for guys with erectile dysfunction, what the science says, and how to use it safely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Link Between Vitamin D and ED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is mainly produced in the skin following exposure to sunlight. It also plays a critical role in many bodily processes, including immune support, bone health, hormone regulation, and vascular function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D receptors are found in endothelial cells, which line blood vessels and regulate vascular tone. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction—all of which can impair penile blood flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ED is often managed with medications like sildenafil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eonlinepharmacystore.com/cenforce-100-mg-sildenafil"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cenforce 100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; At the same time, interest is growing in how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; might support erogenous health, particularly in men with low vitamin D levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A number of studies have shown that men with low vitamin D levels are more likely to suffer from ED. For instance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2015 study published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that men with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have severe ED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A meta-analysis published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The World Journal of Men's Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2020 suggested that vitamin D supplementation could moderately improve erectile function, particularly in those with documented deficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Men with Low Vitamin D or ED Symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clinical trials and expert recommendations suggest higher doses may be more effective for restoring optimal blood levels and potentially supporting erectile function:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2,000 to 4,000 IU daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is often used in studies without reported adverse effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In cases of confirmed deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL), doctors may recommend &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;50,000 IU weekly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for 6–8 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Endocrine Society sets the upper safe limit at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;10,000 IU daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though long-term high doses should only be taken under medical supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177056"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your levels are low, supplementation can help—not just for ED, but for overall cardiovascular and hormonal health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mechanisms: How Vitamin D May Help Erectile Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Improved Endothelial Function: Vitamin D promotes nitric oxide production, a key molecule in initiating and sustaining an erection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177057"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reduced Inflammation: Chronic inflammation can damage blood vessels; vitamin D’s anti-inflammatory effects may reduce this risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Boosting Testosterone: Low testosterone is a known contributor to ED. Some studies show that vitamin D may help raise testosterone levels in men with low D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Improved Mood and Reduced Depression: Depression and stress are significant psychological contributors to ED. Vitamin D may improve mood through its effect on brain neurotransmitters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177058"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get Tested First: Measure vitamin D levels via a blood test (25(OH)D). Use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eonlinepharmacystore.com/cenforce-100-mg-sildenafil"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cenforce 100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sildenafil as Needed: For erotic activity; avoid daily use unless prescribed. Use Vitamin D Daily: Consistency matters; results appear gradually over weeks or months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid these complications, stick to doses &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;below 4,000 IU daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; unless prescribed otherwise by a physician. Periodic blood testing is crucial if taking higher doses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lifestyle Factors That Enhance Vitamin D and Sexual Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177059"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sunlight: Just 15–30 minutes of midday sun on your face, arms, or legs can help your body produce adequate vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diet: Fatty fish (like salmon), egg yolks, and fortified foods contain small amounts of vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise: Regular physical activity improves blood flow, testosterone, and mood—all factors that influence erectile function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177060"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weight management: Obesity is linked to low vitamin D and ED; losing excess weight can help normalize both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Thoughts: How Much Should You Take?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re experiencing ED and suspect low vitamin D may be a contributing factor, consider:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting tested first to determine your vitamin D status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If deficient (&amp;lt;30 ng/mL): Consider 2,000–4,000 IU daily, or a higher dose under supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If adequate: Maintaining a daily intake of 1,000–2,000 IU is safe and may support vascular and hormonal health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D isn't a magic pill for ED, but in men with low levels, supplementation may offer a modest but meaningful improvement—especially when paired with broader lifestyle changes and medical guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;Following tests on mosquitoes for West Nile Virus, the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District reported that virus activity is increasing, earlier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Metropolitan Mosquito Control District (MMCD) said &lt;em&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/em&gt;, the mosquito species most responsible for transmitting WNV to humans, was active in some of the highest numbers ever recorded by the organization.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMCD lab tested 133 mosquito pools and found 34 were positive for WNV, over 25% of the tested pools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMCD warns a positive test was also found in the seven counties they monitor, which include Hennepin, Ramsey, Anoka, Washington, Dakota, Scott and Carver counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the highest positivity rates ever recorded in July and is more typical with late August when the mosquito populations are winding down,” MMCD said in a statement. “With the elevated risk of West Nile virus, it is important that residents take steps to protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMCD advises residents to wear an EPA-registered insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants that have light colors and are loose, remove stagnant water and avoid the outdoors during peak mosquito activity hours surrounding dawn and dusk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information on WNV can be found on the &lt;a href="https://mmcd.org/west-nile-virus/"&gt;MMCD website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s world, allergies are nearly unavoidable. For instance, a report from Stanford Medicine suggests that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/allergyandasthma/clinical-care/learn-about-allergies.html"&gt;nearly 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the human population (over three billion people) suffers from at least one allergic condition, making allergies one of the most widespread health issues globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation is even worrisome in the US, where over 50 percent of all kids suffer from this problem. However, surprisingly,  there’s one group in America that seems almost immune to allergies, &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/gene-mutation-common-amish-community-might-extend-lifespan-10-years/"&gt;the Amish&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the earlier 50 percent figure, only seven percent of Amish kids have developed any allergic condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “generally, across the country, about 8 to 10 percent of kids have asthma. In the Amish kids, it’s probably 1 to 2 percent. A few of them do have allergies, but at much, much lower rates compared to the general population,” Carole Ober, an expert on human genetics from the University of Chicago, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/20/allergies-amish-hygiene-thesis/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These numbers are so incredible that scientists are now digging deep into Amish barns and homes to understand how these children are being protected. They believe that their findings could lead to treatments that prevent &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/gene-mutation-common-amish-community-might-extend-lifespan-10-years/"&gt;allergies altogether&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-secret-to-allergy-resistance-in-the-amish"&gt;The secret to allergy resistance in the Amish&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amish are a group of people in the United States and parts of Canada who live a very simple, traditional lifestyle and mainly &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/crops-future-farming-robots-9432432/"&gt;rely on farming&lt;/a&gt; and livestock for their livelihood. They still ride horse buggies and typically stay away from modern gadgets such as TVs and smartphones. In recent years, the mystery behind the Amish resistance to allergies led scientists from several universities to compare the Amish with other traditional farming groups, particularly the Hutterites. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both groups have similar ancestry and lifestyles. However, only Amish children showed extremely low allergy and asthma rates. This finding suggested that genetics isn’t the answer. Something else is at play here. So the researchers looked at how children in each group interacted with their environment. They found a major difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Hutterite kids and pregnant moms don’t go into the animal barns. Kids aren’t really exposed to the animal barns until they’re like 12 or so, when they start learning how to do the work on the farm. The Amish kids are in and out of the cow barns all day long from an early age,” Ober said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed dust samples from Amish and Hutterite homes, they discovered that Amish house dust had nearly seven times more microbes. To test whether this made a difference, they exposed mice to each type of dust. Mice that inhaled Amish dust showed much less inflammation in their airways when &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/could-a-cure-for-allergies-be-right-around-the-corner-research-suggests-so/"&gt;exposed to allergens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whereas mice exposed to Hutterite dust didn’t get that benefit. This strongly suggested that early, regular exposure to certain farm microbes trained the immune system of Amish kids to react calmly instead of aggressively to substances like pollen or food. This phenomenon is called the farm effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1140x760.jpg 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1024x683.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-287596 sp-no-webp" alt="" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Amish men and women walking near a river.

&lt;p&gt;In a further &lt;a href="https://archive.is/o/gJZKp/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674923007066"&gt;study in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took it a step further and identified special proteins in Amish dust. These proteins act like transporters, carrying microbial and plant molecules straight into the airways, where they help regulate immune responses. In short, early exposure to the barn dust (farm effect) creates a shield inside the body, one that keeps &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/womans-nut-allergy-triggered-after-sex-in-bizarre-first/"&gt;allergy-triggering&lt;/a&gt; reactions from spiraling out of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These clues about the origin of the farm effect represent a step toward the prevention of allergic diseases,” Kirsi Järvinen-Seppo, Chief of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-to-attack-allergies-before-they-appear"&gt;Time to attack allergies before they appear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, most allergy treatments, like inhalers for asthma or antihistamines for hay fever, only manage symptoms. This is because they are typically administered after the allergy has already taken hold in the body. However, what we truly need is something that could prevent the onset of allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obviously, every household can not &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/cow-therapy-animals/"&gt;have a barn&lt;/a&gt;, but by studying the microbes responsible for the farm effect, scientists believe it is possible to replicate the protective effect of the Amish environment. For instance, they could develop proactive solutions, such as probiotics, nasal sprays, or even dust-derived treatments that train a child’s immune system in the early years of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that we can give every family a cow. But we are learning from these time-honored and very stable environments what type of substances and exposures are needed. Once we know that, I don’t think there will be any impediment to creating protective strategies along these lines,” Donata Vercelli, an expert in molecular biology at the University of Arizona, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that something as simple as barn dust could protect millions of children is both fascinating and hopeful. However, to realize this at full scale, researchers now need to identify exactly &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/the-strangest-microbe-ever-found-staddles-the-line-between-life-and-non-life/"&gt;which microbes&lt;/a&gt; and molecules provide the strongest protection, and they must ensure any treatment is both safe and easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study has revealed highly intensity grief that persists can send you to an early grave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Dr Nielsen told MedicalExpress: 'A GP could look for previous signs of depression and other severe mental health conditions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This would allow them to refer them to the relevant secondary care or follow-up bereavement appointments focusing on mental health, she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study which started in 2012, followed participants who were of an average age of 62 for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It identified five 'grief trajectories' that categorised how participants experienced their grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, experienced by 38 per cent, was 'persistently low levels of grief symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then nearly a fifth had 'high but decreasing' symptoms, while 29 per cent had 'moderate but decreasing' grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another nine per cent of participants began with lower levels of grief that increased, peaking at six months, before reducing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the study only six per cent of participants reported experiencing the highest levels of grief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The six per cent with highest grief' symptoms that persisted over time, were those with a higher risk of an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously experts warned found that grief can cause broken heart syndrome, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The life-threatening phenomenon, which affects around 2,500 Brits every year, is a reaction by the heart to a sudden release of stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes part of the heart to become temporarily enlarged and struggle to pump blood properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say it can cause the same symptoms and complications as a heart attack, which can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, unlike those who suffer heart attacks, broken heart syndrome is not linked with blocked arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can be misdiagnosed as a heart attack, stopping patients from receiving the right treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12952029/Broken-heart-syndrome-JUST-deadly-heart-attack-study-finds-claim-Sinead-OConnors-ex-partner-star-56-died-little-understood-condition.html"&gt;MailOnline &lt;/a&gt;reported that scientists based at the University of Aberdeen claimed the syndrome is not being treated correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their five-year-study, based on 4,000 people in Scotland showed around a quarter of patients with the condition died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis also showed that drugs used to prevent heart attacks did not improve the survival rate of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, despite being the go-to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings came after the ex-partner of Sinead O'Connor insisted that the star, 56, died of a broken 'broken heart'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her son Shane took his own life 18 months before the singer passed.

After monitoring her for half an hour, a nurse gave her a shot to try to stop her hemorrhaging. It didn’t work. The doctor ordered some bloodwork and made a startling discovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7487f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re just admiring our new baby and soaking it all in,” Hilmer, 34, of Marion, Iowa, recalls to TODAY.com. “The doctor said, ‘The labs came back from the sample that I just sent off, and it came back positive for acute leukemia.’ And I didn’t know what acute meant. All I heard was leukemia.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-567b58" class="body-graf"&gt;Hilmer couldn’t believe it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8b855" class="body-graf"&gt;“I froze,” she says. “My fiancé and I stared at each other in shock and in disbelief with eyes wide open.

Her bloodwork didn’t reveal any red flags, and she felt good. During the last month she was pregnant, she started experiencing “pretty intense pains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c515e3" class="body-graf"&gt;“The pains would radiate from down my arms or starting at my lower back all the way down to my legs,” she says. “I thought that those were sciatica pains because sciatica is pretty common in pregnant women, especially towards the end.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-09a815"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1996"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg" alt="Grappling with new motherhood and a cancer diagnosis at the same time felt tough.

Hoping for help, she visited the emergency room, and they assured her that she was experiencing “pregnancy pains.” On October 22, 2022, Hilmer went into labor at home and went to the hospital “expecting to have a completely normal and healthy delivery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-223f22" class="body-graf"&gt;“The delivery was fine,” she says. “It’s obviously common to be losing blood after delivery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00f15b" class="body-graf"&gt;When the nurses checked on her, though, they noticed Hilmer was bleeding more than normal, but they decided to monitor her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc769c" class="body-graf"&gt;“This went on for I want to say roughly 30 minutes to an hour of the nurses pressing on my stomach and measuring and keeping track of how much blood I was losing,” she says. “I was hemorrhaging … I was losing so much blood.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26b2de" class="body-graf"&gt;A nurse administered medication to slow the bleeding. But she continued bleeding heavily. Doctors considered sending her for a hysterectomy to stop it. However, the doctor who performed the delivery first opted for blood work to see if that could reveal what was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55f5b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Then the doctor returned and explained to Hilmer that she had acute myeloid leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33436c" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was like, ‘Are you telling me that I have cancer?’” she recalls. “He’s like, ‘Yes, unfortunately that’s what the labs show.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed120c" class="body-graf"&gt;Hilmer was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-192b17" class="body-graf"&gt;“I really was like, ‘Are you sure that’s true?

At one point, she needed oxygen because she developed pneumonia from COVID-19, and breathing became difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70addb" class="body-graf"&gt;“That was awful,” Hilmer says. “I really, really wanted to be able to breastfeed my baby and, of course, I could not because I was receiving chemotherapy … that honestly broke my heart.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7234b2" class="body-graf"&gt;After she went home, she visited a local hospital for bloodwork so doctors could track her health. She needed to undergo blood and platelet transfusions "multiple times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739f7f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I had to continuously get those a lot because if your counts are below a certain number, it’s dangerous,” Hilmer explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8015d7" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors hoped she could undergo a stem cell transplant to fully treat her cancer, but they needed to find a donor. She underwent a round of maintenance chemotherapy as she waited for her transplant and by January 2023, they found a match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85e5e6" class="body-graf"&gt;“They told me around 60ish percent of the (blood) cells in my body were cancerous and that’s considered moderate to high risk,” she says. “They thought it was important for me to get the stem cell transplant in order to have the best chance of non-relapsing and not having the cancer come back.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bddf62" class="body-graf"&gt;She returned to University of Iowa Health Care and underwent a “potent” round of chemotherapy to kill off as many cancer cells as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbf45c" class="body-graf"&gt;“That was pretty rough,” she says. “All of my donor’s healthy, non-cancerous cells (were) infused into my body and basically took the place of my old cells that they got rid of with chemotherapy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-605ead" class="body-graf"&gt;After recovering in the hospital for a few weeks, Hilmer returned home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff6c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a successful transplant,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a8aa7b" class="body-heading"&gt;Acute Myeloid Leukemia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a9b9a" class="body-graf"&gt;While acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can occur at any age, the average age of diagnosis is about 70, says Dr. David Dickens. It’s a type of cancer that impacts the white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3167dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“The fact that we’re dealing with somebody who’s younger is even more atypical than most patients with AML,” Dickens, director of the Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Program at University of Iowa Health Care, tells TODAY.com. “The fact that it lines up with a delivery is more unusual.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_noCaption__qtPhQ" id="anchor-8d6f54"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1890" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-04-8033a6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-04-8033a6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-04-8033a6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-04-8033a6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-04-8033a6.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Danika Hilmer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-610641" class="body-graf"&gt;Leukemias start in the bone marrow and can spread quickly throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a8b59" class="body-graf"&gt;“Inside the bone you have this liquid space where all of these factories that make blood cells live — mostly in your pelvis, your lower back, a little bit in your upper legs,” Dickens says. “Because it’s liquid, it can spread all over the body, it circulates around in the bloodstream.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74b3ea" class="body-graf"&gt;Some people with leukemia might experience swollen lymph nodes. Other symptoms include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-1c0512" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unusual bleeding or bruising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a12dbe" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/mom-40-diagnosed-leukemia-kids-pediatrician-spotted-skin-changes-rcna117374" target="_blank"&gt;off-color&lt;/a&gt; to their skin &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a13846" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fevers without an illness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d0642" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re not having any cold symptoms and you feel the lymph nodes, that might be a sign,” he says. “No patient has zero signs. No patient has all of it. It’s usually somewhere in the middle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d34d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Many of the symptoms, though, can be easily mistaken for something else. Loads of people feel exhausted and that’s not a sign that they have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b055b" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatments for leukemia typically involve chemotherapy and, in some cases, a stem cell transplant, also called a bone marrow transplant. For people with some genetic mutations of AML, doctors believe a stem cell transplant is more effective treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-feb0e9" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have one of those genetic mutations and you’re young enough to be able to tolerate it … doctors might prescribe a bone marrow transplant,” Dickens explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c80b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;While Hilmer’s diagnosis was uncommon, Dickens says it was wise that her doctor ran bloodwork before considering the hysterectomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afe41d" class="body-graf"&gt;“Anybody who might be worried about (excessive bleeding should) take a blood count. It’s easy enough,” Dickens says. “There could be a lot of different reasons why somebody would have abnormal bleeding that isn’t leukemia, but that test will definitely pick up leukemia if it happens.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-448e06" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Miracle Baby’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-919b21" class="body-graf"&gt;Since undergoing her transplant in 2023, Hilmer’s leukemia has not returned. At her six-week postpartum check-up, the doctor who delivered Banks revealed to her that if they had proceeded with the hysterectomy without bloodwork, the outcome would have been very different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-661c02" class="body-graf"&gt;“He told me that I likely would have bled out during surgery,” she says. “I would not have survived.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-954989" class="body-graf"&gt;Banks is also doing well, and Hilmer and her fiancé gave him a special nickname. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f4dd6" class="body-graf"&gt;“We like to think of Banks as our miracle baby because if I wasn’t pregnant and if I didn’t have him it’s (unclear) how long my cancer would have gone undiagnosed,” Hilmer says. “If I had gone a month or two, even longer, without being diagnosed, there’s a solid chance I wouldn’t be here.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f7a69" class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, however, Hilmer received some devastating news —she has Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer. She’ll soon undergo a double mastectomy to treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-01f39e"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1785"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg" alt="Danika Hilmer calls her son, Banks, her 'miracle baby' because he helped her receive a cancer diagnosis quickly.

Why is it known as a brain-eating amoeba?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Naegleria fowleri is a type of amoeba that can cause a rare but nearly always fatal brain infection.

              &lt;p&gt;Dozens of restaurant goers in Wisconsin had the sort of meal you wouldn’t ever forget. A recent case report details how they were accidentally fed food made with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary ingredient in cannabis responsible for getting you high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Local health officials described the sitcom-like shenanigans in a report &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a2.htm"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Nearly 100 customers ate the restaurant’s THC-laced food in late October, some of whom visited the hospital as a result. The source of the “outbreak” was eventually traced back to THC-infused cooking oil mistaken for ordinary canola oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians and public health practitioners should be alert to the possibility of mass THC intoxication events via food,” the report authors, from Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the trouble (or fun, depending on your perspective) began sometime on October 22. Over the next three days, at least 85 people between the ages of 1 and 91 became intoxicated shortly after eating at the restaurant, including seven people who were sent to a local hospital with symptoms like dizziness, sleepiness, and anxiety. One individual was advised to call Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County; the person reported they had tested positive for THC without any known exposure and that they had eaten at the restaurant the day before, prompting further investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On October 24, officials contacted the restaurant’s owner, who agreed to immediately shut the place down. That same day, the owner called back and reported that the restaurant was in a building with a cooperative (shared) kitchen used by another business that produced THC edibles derived from hemp. The owner also reported that on October 22, the restaurant ran out of its cooking oil and began using oil from the shared kitchen—which the owner assumed was simply canola oil—to make the dough for its pizzas, sandwiches, and other bread-filled goods. A large oil container in the same area where the borrowed oil was found was then tested and found positive for THC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials brought in the local police for help, who determined that the restaurant’s THC contamination was indeed an accident, and no criminal charges were filed against the owner or others. It also appears no one was seriously hurt as a result. After a thorough cleaning, the restaurant opened back up on October 26.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As funny as all this sounds, anyone who’s mistakenly bitten into an edible or knows someone who has (&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;) can attest that it isn’t always a picnic to deal with, even if the effects are ultimately temporary. The victims also included eight children, three who experienced vomiting and one who even developed hallucinations. Thankfully, none of them were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say more should be done to prevent these sorts of incidents, given the rising popularity of THC and cannabis-centered businesses, especially if the businesses share space with restaurants. “Regulations regarding practices such as standard, clear labeling and locked storage for ingredients containing THC, might decrease the risk for unintentional THC exposure at licensed food businesses,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m just wondering if the incident lowered or boosted the restaurant’s Yelp rating.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While laws around surrogates, or “gestational carriers”, vary around the world, the practice is booming. According to Global Market Insights, the market is expected to grow from $27.9bn (£20.8bn) in 2025 to $201.8bn (£150.2bn) in 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings underscore the importance of adequate screening and counselling of potential gestational carriers before pregnancy about the possibility of a new-onset mental illness, or exacerbation of a prior mental illness during or after pregnancy,” said Dr Maria Velez, the first author of the research, from McGill University in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. “As well, the provision of support during and after pregnancy may be particularly important for gestational carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.23428" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Jama Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, Velez and colleagues report how they analysed data from 767,406 births in Ontario that occurred between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of these, 748,732 involved unassisted conceptions, 758 involved surrogacy, and the others involved &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ivf" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;IVF&lt;/a&gt; in mothers who carried their own babies. Velez said the vast majority of surrogacy cases in Canada involved the surrogate being unrelated to the child, meaning the surrogate’s eggs were not used in conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among those excluded from this initial analysis were women with a record of mental illness prior to the estimated date of conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team analysed the number of women in each group who received a diagnosis of a new-onset mental illness since the estimated date of conception, such as anxiety disorder, mood disorder, self-harm or psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These diagnoses occurred in 236 surrogates, 195,022 women who had an unassisted conception and 4,704 women who had received IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for factors such as age, income, smoking and number of children, this corresponded to a 43% and 29% higher incidence rate of new mental illness per 100 people per year of follow-up in surrogates compared with women who had an unassisted conception or IVF, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For all three groups, mood or anxiety disorder was the most common diagnosis, while median time from conception to diagnosis was similar, at about two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers found the risk of new mental illness remained elevated in surrogates, but to a lesser degree, when compared with women who had an unassisted conception but no longer lived with their child a year after the birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The finding might suggest that some gestational carriers may experience grief from relinquishing their newborn, like that described after adoption or removal of the child into foster care – something that needs further studies,” said Velez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team then carried out further analyses that included women with a previous record of mental illness and found all groups in this category had a higher rate of new-onset mental illness than those with no previous record. Despite Canada requiring would-be surrogates to undergo psychological assessments, the results revealed 19% of surrogates in the study had a documented diagnosis of mental illness before pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study follows &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/23/surrogates-face-higher-risk-of-pregnancy-complications-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; by the team that found surrogates were more likely to experience complications including severe postpartum haemorrhage and severe pre-eclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Zaina Mahmoud, an expert on the socio-legal aspects of surrogacy at the University of Liverpool, in England, who was not involved in the work, said further research was needed to explore whether the greater risk of new mental illness in surrogates was down to the pregnancy itself, and the mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The researchers are] not addressing why or how surrogates have these emotional trajectories,” she said, adding that the team had used very broad definitions of mental illness. “They hypothesise that grief from relinquishing the infant may contribute, but they don’t actually measure that grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Mahmoud backed the call for greater screening and support for potential surrogates, saying the work suggested support should last for more than two years after the birth. The studies “really highlight the need for robust information and consent procedures”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOMjBoZDRjTkllRVhSWkN5TVZLTWJTanhza2xBLVpCTGd1dnZFRG13dVpKMG95dnVYVlhPemt1YUFReXR3WE1sVUhTNGJjMXBwZVZscko2dzczNVJtQ0dfeTRFd0k2ZmZYX0lDZW1VYkVuS2J4dzlxWktuM0QwWmtfSWJSZnR1d2xlcVRmSHlhSlJtd1R2YVJwbnIzeVMtaDVxOHZYTi1CWmNUaUotUFRZaWpneWFCX0h5OVpuN1lB</guid></item><item><title>当您停止服用像Ozempic这样的药物时，体重就会恢复，研究结果- ScienceAlert | Weight Comes Back When You Stop Taking Drugs Like Ozempic, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNMFlHRmxqTUJFUWRrZEU3UHNTeDRHNTE0VlJaNV9fUGdBZnNtS3lRbVdVTDRFQXh5dTktYm5qdVVHS2N0STJIX3pRZWtNeDlKcEJ1VmJvRHZRNkhQcW5RRDVRNGgwVEJxS3N1TjA4NmpCTkFCNXlwa0dKZ2FRallIemliMHVYYzJsMUhSWlRmSnlpdVdHd1RuQzJBNDRvWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We've got fresh evidence for how weight can quickly be regained after weight-loss programs stop – but rather than looking at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bacteria-inside-you-may-explain-why-weight-piles-on-after-dieting"&gt;traditional dieting&lt;/a&gt;, here the researchers wanted to focus on anti-obesity medications (AOMs), as they continue to be used ever more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Peking University in China reviewed 11 previous studies involving a total of 2,466 people. The studies covered a variety of AOMs, including those known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy), which impersonate the natural hormone GLP-1 to control appetite and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that AOMs were effective at helping people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-3-signs-you-might-be-losing-weight-too-quickly"&gt;to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. However, they all had something else in common: the weight tended to come back once the course of drugs was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-could-treat-chronic-migraines-trial-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs Could Treat Chronic Migraines, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Significant weight regain occurred eight weeks after discontinuation of AOMs and was sustained through 20 weeks," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; the research team, led by first author Han Wu. "Different weight regain was observed in subjects with different characteristics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169031" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss.jpg" alt="Weight gain" class="wp-image-169031 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss-488x415.jpg 488w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss-600x510.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169031" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Weight regain tended to rise and then plateau, while BMI followed a different course. (Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMC Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the different types of weight loss treatments covered, it was those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;in the GLP-1 category&lt;/a&gt; that showed the most weight gain after treatment had stopped, driving the rest of the results – though they did account for most of the studies analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 20 weeks after stopping their drugs, the participants in the studies had put back on an average of 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds). The team also found that people who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-weight-loss-paradox-shedding-significant-pounds-can-be-deadly-for-some"&gt;lost more weight&lt;/a&gt; tended to regain more afterwards too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help isolate the effects of stopping the medicines, the researchers accounted for several other factors that can also influence weight loss, including levels of exercise and whether or not the individuals concerned &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-new-form-of-diabetes-has-been-officially-recognized"&gt;had diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this is happening isn't clear. Future studies might be able to look at the underlying reasons more closely, but there's the possibility that weight loss somehow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-cells-seem-to-cling-to-the-memory-of-being-obese-study-finds"&gt;rewires the body&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of ways that then make it harder to keep to a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effects of weight cycling on health and systemic metabolism are not thoroughly defined," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the previous studies looked at in the new analysis was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-gain-common-after-stopping-new-obesity-drugs-study-shows"&gt;published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and found that when weekly injections of tirzepatide (or Zepbound) were stopped and participants were switched to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="169028" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, an average of half the lost weight came back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out that this isn't just a problem with weight-loss drugs. It's something that's also been seen in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-7-key-tips-to-avoid-weight-regain-after-you-diet"&gt;other approaches to staying slim&lt;/a&gt;, including gastric bypasses and vertical banded gastroplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's another consideration to bear in mind when weighing up AOMs that produce impressive results – there may be a cost to pay later. Questions have already been asked about some of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-type-drugs-may-trigger-brain-changes-linked-to-depression"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-weight-loss-drugs-under-scrutiny-amid-pancreas-concerns"&gt;health risks&lt;/a&gt; that may come with AOMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers are keen to see new studies carried out, covering bigger sample groups over longer periods of time. It's possible that we can find better ways of supporting people once they come off AOMs – or find &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;healthier alternatives to them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Studies with longer follow-up duration are required to further investigate the potential factors associated with weight change after discontinuation of treatment," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Researchers criticised “aggressive mandates and the zealotry &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/07/15/fury-german-health-minister-pushes-fourth-covid-vaccine-everyone/"&gt;to vaccinate everyone&lt;/a&gt; at all cost”, adding that the findings had implications for how future vaccine rollouts were handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and the study’s first author, said: “I think early estimates were based on many parameters having values that are incompatible with our current understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In principle, targeting the populations who would get the vast majority of the benefit and letting alone those with questionable risk-benefit and cost-benefit makes a lot of sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aggressive mandates and the zealotry &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/01/the-true-tragedy-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/"&gt;to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; everyone at all cost were probably a bad idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Overly optimistic vaccine effectiveness’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 13 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered since 2021. But there have been mounting concerns that vaccines &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/17/covid-vaccine-harms-cost-government-17bn-inquiry/"&gt;could be harmful&lt;/a&gt; for some people, particularly the young, and that the risk was not worth the benefit for a population at little risk from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 17,500 Britons have applied to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/14/vaccine-injury-scheme-taxpayers-paid-out-victims/"&gt;the Government’s vaccine damage payment scheme&lt;/a&gt;, believing they or loved ones were injured by the jabs. In June, manufacturers added warnings for myocarditis and pericarditis to the prescribing information of Covid messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the experts used worldwide population data alongside vaccine effectiveness and infection fatality rates to estimate how many people died from a Covid infection before or after the periods of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team believes earlier modelling may have used overly pessimistic infection fatality rates and overly optimistic vaccine effectiveness, while failing to consider how quickly protection waned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies may also have underestimated how many people had already been unknowingly infected by the time they had the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Benefit ‘mostly limited’ to older people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Angelo Maria Pezzullo, a researcher in general and applied hygiene at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, said: “Before ours, several studies tried to estimate lives saved by vaccines with different models and in different periods or parts of the world, but this one is the most comprehensive because it is based on worldwide data. It also covers &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/15/covid-face-masks-did-not-stop-spread-omicron/"&gt;the omicron period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also calculates the number of years of life that was saved, and it is based on fewer assumptions about the pandemic trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team calculated that around 14.8 million life-years were saved, one life-year per 900 vaccine doses administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that although vaccines had a “substantial benefit” on global mortality, it was “mostly limited” to older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The over-70s made up nearly 70 per cent of the lives saved, while those aged 60 to 70 accounted for a further 20 per cent. In contrast, under-20s made up just 0.01 per cent of lives saved, and 20 to 30s were 0.07 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Reasons for concerns are validated’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Stefania Boccia, of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, added: “These estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations that focused mainly on the first year of vaccination, but clearly demonstrate an important overall benefit from Covid-19 vaccination over the period 2020-2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the benefits, in terms of lives and life-years saved, have been secured for a portion of the global population who is typically more fragile – the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who fought against &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/uk-news-update-cases-deaths-vaccine-test-today-rules/"&gt;vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;, said: “Frankly it’s a good cautionary tale that if we have another pandemic we should be far more clinical about the risk-benefit ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew pretty quickly who the most susceptible groups were and we should have focused very strictly on them, rather than placing people who were at little risk &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/04/covid-vaccines-may-have-helped-fuel-rise-in-excess-deaths/"&gt;in hazard’s way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The level of aggression of trying to force people to become vaccinated and shutting down people who were raising concerns, the reasons for those concerns are all validated in this report.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research was published in Jama Health Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

Lloyd Huck Chair Professor in Nanomedicine at Penn State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's prototype device can detect HMGB1 - a protein involved in endometriosis development and progression - in period blood with 500 percent more accuracy and confirm whether a person is suffering from the condition, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conduct the test, a sample of blood  needs to be added to what looks like a Covid testing strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If any HMGB1 proteins are present, they bind to the antibodies in the blood and when tested, turn two stripes dark - giving a positive result for endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/endometriosis-home-test-diagnosis-period-blood-2102953"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'Currently, the only definitive [diagnostic] method is laparoscopic surgery [keyhole surgery, often invasive]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While menstrual blood is not yet a standard diagnostic tool for endometriosis, it's an active area of research with the potential to revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed and monitored in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For a positive test result for endometriosis, two stripes dark on the test (left) and  in case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With our technology, we are hoping to democratize women's health by providing a much-needed tool to track the onset or progression of this disease at the convenience and privacy of home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We anticipate that combining this technology with clinical symptoms will allow for early detection or diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents and women.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he also noted that the new test can help reduce the costs and time involved in scheduling and conducting a laparoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'A recent study found that the average cost for a woman with endometriosis was around $30,000 per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This huge financial burden can be reduced [as well as the shame and isolation from stigma] if an accurate at-home test becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our technology once developed, can reduce the time of diagnosis dramatically from years to minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Technologies are being developed that claim to be 'at-home' tests for endometriosis, but in fact they are developing ways to collect samples for laboratories to test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan also noted that with further testing and funding, he and his team intend to make the test accessible to people of all incomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, he also hopes to integrate the tests into period pads, making it possible to discreetly and conveniently monitor HMGB1 levels this way at home too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It is our goal to [eventually] provide the kits directly to the public, at a reasonable price point, so women can do the test at home and share the results with their doctors, who will offer diagnoses and advice about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are looking at a couple of years of effort at this point. The team is actively looking for funding and partners to further develop the test. With funding, this timeline can be reduced in my opinion.

Lloyd Huck Chair Professor in Nanomedicine at Penn State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's prototype device can detect HMGB1 - a protein involved in endometriosis development and progression - in period blood with 500 percent more accuracy and confirm whether a person is suffering from the condition, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conduct the test, a sample of blood  needs to be added to what looks like a Covid testing strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If any HMGB1 proteins are present, they bind to the antibodies in the blood and when tested, turn two stripes dark - giving a positive result for endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/endometriosis-home-test-diagnosis-period-blood-2102953"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'Currently, the only definitive [diagnostic] method is laparoscopic surgery [keyhole surgery, often invasive]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While menstrual blood is not yet a standard diagnostic tool for endometriosis, it's an active area of research with the potential to revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed and monitored in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For a positive test result for endometriosis, two stripes dark on the test (left) and  in case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With our technology, we are hoping to democratize women's health by providing a much-needed tool to track the onset or progression of this disease at the convenience and privacy of home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We anticipate that combining this technology with clinical symptoms will allow for early detection or diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents and women.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he also noted that the new test can help reduce the costs and time involved in scheduling and conducting a laparoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'A recent study found that the average cost for a woman with endometriosis was around $30,000 per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This huge financial burden can be reduced [as well as the shame and isolation from stigma] if an accurate at-home test becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our technology once developed, can reduce the time of diagnosis dramatically from years to minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Technologies are being developed that claim to be 'at-home' tests for endometriosis, but in fact they are developing ways to collect samples for laboratories to test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan also noted that with further testing and funding, he and his team intend to make the test accessible to people of all incomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, he also hopes to integrate the tests into period pads, making it possible to discreetly and conveniently monitor HMGB1 levels this way at home too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It is our goal to [eventually] provide the kits directly to the public, at a reasonable price point, so women can do the test at home and share the results with their doctors, who will offer diagnoses and advice about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are looking at a couple of years of effort at this point. The team is actively looking for funding and partners to further develop the test. With funding, this timeline can be reduced in my opinion. '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months.

Interestingly, individuals with this disorder who had fewer heavy drinking days in the past two weeks tended to have higher concentrations of glutathione in this brain region. The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112705"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug and Alcohol Dependence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder is a medical condition characterized by an inability to control or stop drinking alcohol despite negative consequences. It involves both physical dependence and psychological compulsion to consume alcohol. Symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal symptoms when the person stops drinking, and continued use despite harm to health or relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic alcohol use affects the brain’s structure and function. It can shrink brain volume, especially in areas like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are important for decision-making, memory, and self-control. Chronic heavy drinking also disrupts neurotransmitter systems, including GABA, glutamate, and dopamine, altering mood, behavior, and cognition. Long-term alcohol use can damage white matter in the brain, slowing down communication between brain regions. It may also reduce the brain’s ability to produce and regulate certain antioxidants, increasing vulnerability to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with alcohol use disorder tend to have problems with attention, impulse control, and emotional regulation. Some brain changes can improve with abstinence, but others may be long-lasting or permanent, depending on severity and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author James J. Prisciandaro and his colleagues wanted to compare concentrations of glutathione in the brains of individuals with alcohol use disorder and those of light drinkers. Glutathione is the brain’s primary antioxidant. When chronic heavy drinking increases oxidative stress in the brain, the brain increases the production of glutathione to try to compensate for this change and reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress is an imbalance between harmful free radicals and the body’s ability to neutralize them with antioxidants (like glutathione). With continued heavy drinking, the body’s capacity to counter oxidative stress through increased production of antioxidants is eventually overwhelmed, resulting in diminished levels of antioxidants and cell and tissue damage due to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from a previous study that included 20 individuals with alcohol use disorder who were not previously treated and 20 light drinkers matched with them on demographic characteristics. These individuals completed a Time-Line Followback daily drinking interview for the previous 14 days, allowing researchers to map their alcohol use patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, they underwent magnetic resonance imaging of their brains. The researchers used the neuroimaging data to estimate glutathione levels in participants’ brains. Most participants were men of European descent in their twenties who had last consumed alcohol within 7 days before undergoing neuroimaging for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that participants with alcohol use disorder drank much more alcohol than light drinkers. Neuroimaging showed that they had significantly higher concentrations of glutathione in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex region of their brains compared to light drinkers. Interestingly, individuals with alcohol use disorder who had fewer heavy drinking days in the past two weeks tended to have higher concentrations of glutathione in this brain region. This association was not present among light drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this preliminary study are consistent with an interpretation of compensatory GSH [glutathione] upregulation [increase in production] in response to moderate oxidative stress in treatment-naïve individuals with AUD [alcohol use disorder], adding unique support to oxidative stress models of alcohol-related cellular damage and highlighting the potential promise of antioxidant treatments for AUD,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the biochemical changes in the brain associated with heavy drinking. However, it should be noted that these data come from a small group of mostly young males. Results on other demographic groups might not be identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112705"&gt;Brain glutathione levels and associations with recent drinking in treatment-naïve individuals with alcohol use disorder versus light drinkers,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by James J.

While early stages may appear harmless or even symptomless, experts warn that if left untreated, fatty liver can progress to metabolic dysfunction‑associated steatohepatitis (MASH)—a more serious condition involving inflammation and liver damage. This progression can significantly increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer according to a a report by MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas. Fortunately, early detection and lifestyle interventions can often reverse the condition before it becomes life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is MASLD and how does it lead to cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;MASLD refers to fat accumulation in the liver in individuals who consume little or no alcohol. When this condition progresses to MASH, inflammation and damage to liver cells occur. Over time, this can result in fibrosis (scarring) and eventually cirrhosis, both of which are known risk factors for liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in cases where cirrhosis hasn’t yet developed, the presence of MASH significantly increases cancer risk due to chronic inflammation and cellular damage in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How lifestyle affects your risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your daily habits play a major role in whether fatty liver progresses to cancer. People with unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, and poor sleep quality are more likely to develop MASLD. On the flip side, those who engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy weight, and follow a balanced diet are much less likely to develop advanced liver disease. Diets high in processed foods, red meat, and added sugars tend to worsen liver health, while plant-based foods and whole grains can help protect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is at high risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain individuals are more likely to develop fatty liver disease and face increased cancer risk, including those who:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are overweight or obese, especially with abdominal fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suffer from high cholesterol or triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are diagnosed with metabolic syndrome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of liver disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people worldwide may have MASLD or MASH without knowing it, putting them at risk for complications, including liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs your liver may be affected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease is often called a "silent" condition because many people do not notice symptoms until the disease has advanced.

The following strategies can significantly reduce your risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a healthy weight: Losing just 5–10% of body weight can have a major impact on liver health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adopt a balanced diet: Emphasize vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise regularly: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritize quality sleep: Lack of sleep can worsen insulin resistance and weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid alcohol and tobacco: Both contribute to liver inflammation and damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood sugar and cholesterol: Through diet, exercise, or medications as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek medical guidance: Ask your doctor about liver screening if you have risk factors. New treatments, including weight-loss medications, may also be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease is more than just fat in the liver—it’s a growing health crisis with serious long-term consequences, including liver cancer. The progression from MASLD to MASH to liver cancer can occur quietly, but it can often be stopped or even reversed through timely intervention. With regular checkups, awareness of symptoms, and simple lifestyle changes, you can protect your liver and reduce your risk of life-threatening complications. If you’re at risk, don’t wait—speak with your doctor and take action today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwJBVV95cUxQd0V5czNLUzdrRy1wRnItT2VHblFjcWlIZFl4WHpkMEJ4LXptX3UybGJHZnFablB0RFpJZERaa0NTNHg3XzNUNmxzWXVXNGxRMVNRWS1PM3d0YVJjdnRTSjZCQ0hBTllXV01LSXktOU4zRTZUN2g4cHFsSFk5a1FfQUp0N2NqRlluVTlvZ3pVYjRMM054SjZINnZoMFpNSzBaOUs0dXJYbmtibDRnQ2ZQd1M3RDZTTDB4WTFrai1RbjRkY1htMGpmeFQ4VVpDdDU1Y29GamxzQU5MSjh1YVN5Umx1S2NZNm5peDRhbEFRLV9YdkFzX0N3TXN0VkZaZGExekJN</guid></item><item><title>人工智能将常见的心脏测试转变为拯救生命的筛查工具- SciTechDaily | AI Turns Common Heart Test Into a Life-Saving Screening Tool - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQZjhqdlVnVE9YX0tTZEMyVmFrYmlwa3RFczAtNkliUzRmT2hza3ZrTkI3bFFFRjRqNkRkTEFPUGVCTVBJclpDRm83S1lZaFZuRlpOU2RXelp3bXBucURZT2tQeHdONUN2b2hMTS1BMkhyNG9Fd25lZzlVZDlORkJuVFhpRUZ4RDljM1NtcG82WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:39:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQZjhqdlVnVE9YX0tTZEMyVmFrYmlwa3RFczAtNkliUzRmT2hza3ZrTkI3bFFFRjRqNkRkTEFPUGVCTVBJclpDRm83S1lZaFZuRlpOU2RXelp3bXBucURZT2tQeHdONUN2b2hMTS1BMkhyNG9Fd25lZzlVZDlORkJuVFhpRUZ4RDljM1NtcG82WQ</guid></item><item><title>蜘蛛咬伤离开爱荷华州青少年为他的生命而战： “你前一刻知道的世界消失了” （独家） - AOL.com | Spider Bite Leaves Iowa Teen Fighting For His Life: 'The World You Knew a Moment Ago Disappears' (Exclusive) - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFB2c3RoRml0MmI0cW1zT0NTWUtReEJqVlJsYjFqamxndkNONjBNUG5NUzZFTWQ5ODFtY25hNE9xbEsteEg2MGF6WmZ2dTlkcEZaUV85TWJzamZLVklJUEtkbXFOaXNnd0l4anM3cHM1SVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, 16-year-old Noah Johnson was working at his brother’s fence-building company, trying to save money to buy a new truck. On June 18, he felt something bite him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rising high school junior from Slater, Iowa, mentioned it to his mom when he got home from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He felt something crawl on him,” says Brandy Johnson, who works in transportation for the Ballard Community School District.  “He said he just jumped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah had a bite on his lower left butt cheek. He went out with his friends that evening and spent the night at a friend's house. When he came home the next morning, he told his mom, "That bite really hurts." She told him to keep an eye on it and to let her know if it got any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson on July 4, 2024&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few days, the bite had tripled in size. Now it was about the size of a silver dollar, and had two black puncture marks. It looked like a pig's snout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very very painful," Brandy says. "He couldn’t even sit down on his bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 23, she took him to urgent care. Doctors suspected it was a spider bite that got infected. They didn't know what kind but could see the “fang bites.” They assured his family that no spiders in the state of Iowa could kill someone, but that bites could become infected quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After closer observation, they prescribed antibiotics, but they also tested him for MRSA, a type of staph bacteria that is often resistant to antibiotics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson shortly before he was bit by a spider&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the infection worsened, and soon he was oozing from not just the spider bite, but two other areas of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy knew he needed to go to the emergency room. They gave him more antibiotics and, even though he had a 103-degree fever, he was sent home. Brandy was told to wait at least 48 hours before bringing him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, his fever remained high, and he could no longer walk. They went to &lt;a href="https://www.mgmc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greeley Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greeley Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in Ames, Iowa, where he was rushed into emergency surgery to cut out the three infected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, he went into kidney failure. He was immediately transferred to &lt;a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/locations/unitypoint-health---blank-childrens-hospital" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blank Children’s Hospital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Blank Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Des Moines, where he spent more than two weeks in the Pediatric ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every day they thought he might get a little better, he went back downhill," his aunt, Chastity Schonhorst, a finance coordinator for a non-profit, says. "It was heartbreaking."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen was placed on dialysis. Doctors biopsied his kidneys, and determined that he had a severe allergic reaction to the pain medication he was given at the first hospital. They hoped his kidneys would begin to recover on their own. A colonoscopy showed a small infection in his intestines. "He fought that for weeks," his aunt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah is a strong teen who played baseball for years, according to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a great kid,” his mother says. Before the spider bite, he was lifting weights for three hours a day, every day, Brandy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the hospital, he lost 35 lbs. and was bedridden. At certain points, he couldn't even speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 16, he finally felt strong enough to talk to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He thought he was dying. He said, ‘I’m very scared,’” she recalls. “I told him, ‘There’s nothing to be scared of. You’re going to be okay.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy asked hospital staff to please only say positive things in front of her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We needed to keep his mind positive to keep fighting,” adds Chastity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Brandy walked outside after spending days at her son's bedside in his hospital room. The sunshine was uplifting, and she thought to herself, "I need to get him outside because it feels so good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She convinced the staff to wheel him out to sit in the sun. "He's an outdoors person," she says. The day after he went outside, his vital signs started to improve. He even told his cousin he would like to go fishing with her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson's mom Brandy took him outside of the hospital to get fresh air and sunshine.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sign of good things to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah was moved out of the ICU in mid-July after his kidneys started functioning and he was able to stop dialysis. "We needed some good news," his aunt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His friends visited him in the hospital every other day. “They stood by him, and it changed him,” Schonhorst says. “We could see a difference in him just having his friends there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Noah’s friends' mothers started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-noah-johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help the Johnsons and to get the community involved in praying for him and the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 21, Brandy and Chastity got the great news that Noah was able to go home. "He’s doing much better, but will need weeks of physical therapy, medications and many doctor's visits," his mom says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although it willl take time to regain his strength, Chastity says, "We are so grateful." They hope he will be able to go back to school in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Brandy has been reflecting on the terrifying experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We live in a world that never slows down," she says. "When someone you love — especially your child — suddenly becomes gravely ill, everything changes in an instant. The world you knew just a moment ago disappears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains further: "The stress over bills, work, or what you were planning for dinner suddenly seems so small. You find yourself holding your breath, watching machines beep, praying for signs of strength in a little body that should never have to fight this kind of battle."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah's ordeal has given her a new perspective. "We spend so much of our lives believing we need more, but when you’re staring at the possibility of losing someone, you realize you already had everything that mattered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/spider-bite-leaves-iowa-teen-fighting-for-his-life-11775715" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:38:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFB2c3RoRml0MmI0cW1zT0NTWUtReEJqVlJsYjFqamxndkNONjBNUG5NUzZFTWQ5ODFtY25hNE9xbEsteEg2MGF6WmZ2dTlkcEZaUV85TWJzamZLVklJUEtkbXFOaXNnd0l4anM3cHM1SVE</guid></item><item><title>强烈的悲伤会使您的死亡风险增加近90 ％ -神经科学新闻 | Intense Grief Can Raise Your Risk of Death by Nearly 90% - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE1SX2FfRUhvNWYxUUg0UkJlaWJLdlhsa0dFYThjWlZVMFVYVm4takJlcmN4VFpsMi1HQ0NjT3hqOFZERnRteExNNV9jdkFJYlBkaUdTLXdUTUhFVnA0amxlcDIxa29rWTlRa0ln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;While grief is a natural part of loss, some people experience persistently high levels that can have long-term health consequences. A decade-long study in Denmark found that individuals with intense, prolonged grief symptoms had significantly higher rates of healthcare use and were nearly twice as likely to die within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals were more likely to receive mental health treatment and medications, including antidepressants and sedatives. Early signs, such as pre-existing mental health conditions and medication use, could help clinicians identify those at greatest risk for tailored support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with persistent high grief symptoms had an 88% higher risk of dying within 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; This group had significantly higher odds of using mental health services and being prescribed psychotropic medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Indicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-loss use of medications and mental health history may predict vulnerability to long-term grief complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grief after the loss of a loved one is a natural response – an inevitable part of living and loving. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a minority of the bereaved, grief is so overwhelming that it can lead to physical and mental illnes, even if they don’t necessarily qualify for a diagnosis with the mental health condition ‘prolonged grief disorder’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, studies have shown that people who recently lost a loved one use healthcare services more often, and have an increased mortality rate, over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from Denmark have shown that bereaved people with persistent high levels of intense grief used more healthcare services and were more likely to die within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first study to investigate the long-term use of healthcare and patterns of mortality over a decade after bereavement in a large-scale cohort,” said Dr Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, a postdoctoral researcher at the Research Unit for General Practice in Aarhus, Denmark, and the study’s corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2012, Nielsen and colleagues followed a cohort of 1,735 bereaved women and men living in Denmark with a mean age of 62 years on enrollment. Among them, 66% had recently lost their partner, 27% a parent, and 7% another kind of loved relation. Through the national register of drug prescriptions, the researchers knew which patients had recently been prescribed treatment for a terminal condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were thus able to contact those dying patients to invite them and their loved ones to participate in the study. The protocol had been approved by the Health Research Ethics of the Central Denmark Region and the Danish Data Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Grief trajectories’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Nielsen &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;had identified five common ‘trajectories’ among this cohort, based on changes in the intensity of grief symptoms over the first three years after losing a loved one. They measured this with the tried-and-tested ‘Prolonged Grief-13’ (PG-13) questionnaire, which assesses symptoms through 13 questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People on the ‘low’ trajectory (38%) displayed persistently low levels of grief symptoms, while 6% followed a ‘high’ trajectory with persistently elevated levels. Three other categories lay between these extremes: 18% and 29% followed a ‘high but decreasing’ and a ‘moderate but decreasing’ trajectory, respectively, and 9% a ‘late onset’ trajectory with a peak of symptoms around six month after bereavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the researchers extended their follow-up of the participants for a total of 10 years until 2022, except for those who died or emigrated earlier. To do so, Nielsen &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; used data from the Danish National Health Service Register to assess how often each participant received ‘talk therapy’ from a GP or specialist, or were prescribed any psychotropic medication. Records from the Danish Registry of Causes of Deaths gave information on deaths from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that for participants on the ‘high’ trajectory, the hazard rate (ie, instantaneous event rate) of dying within 10 years was 88% higher than for participants on a ‘low’ trajectory. They also showed that participants on the ‘high’ trajectory were most likely to receive additional health care services beyond three years after bereavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, these had 186% higher odds of receiving talk therapy or other mental health services, 463% higher odds of being prescribed antidepressants, and 160% higher odds of being prescribed sedatives or anxiety drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catching the warning signs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences in the frequency of use of these healthcare services between the five trajectories were no longer significant after the first eight years, but the excess mortality of participants on the ‘high’ trajectory remained pronounced over the full 10 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might be the physiological cause of the excess mortality? The researchers aren’t sure yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have previously found a connection between high grief symptom levels and higher rates of cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and even suicide. But the association with mortality should be further investigated,” said Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors point out that people at risk for a ‘high’ grief trajectory may be recognizable for intervention early, since the data showed that these patients were prescribed psychotropic medication more often even before their loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘high grief’ group had lower education on average, and their more frequent use of medication before bereavement suggested that they had signs of mental vulnerability, which may cause greater distress on bereavement,” said Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A GP could look for previous signs of depression and other severe mental health conditions. They can then offer these patients tailored follow-up in general practice, or refer them to a private-practice psychologist or secondary care. The GP may also suggest a bereavement follow-up appointment focusing on mental health,” suggested Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this grief and mortality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f4f4d5a4c4c7f594d50514b565a4d4c565111504d58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mischa Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mischa Dijkstra – Frontiers&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1619730/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Grief trajectories and long-term health effects in bereaved relatives: a prospective, population-based cohort study with 10-year follow-up&lt;/a&gt;” by Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grief trajectories and long-term health effects in bereaved relatives: a prospective, population-based cohort study with 10-year follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bereavement may affect the health of relatives, causing increased use of health care services and increased mortality shortly after the patient’s death. However, the long-term consequences for those with a high level of grief symptoms remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to investigate associations between grief symptom trajectories and four long-term health outcomes among relatives bereaved by natural death: contacts to general practice and mental health services, use of psychotropic prescription medication, and mortality, over a period of three to ten years post-bereavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed grief symptoms using the Prolonged Grief-13 scale in a cohort of 1,735 bereaved relatives at three different time points (prior to bereavement, six months after bereavement, and three years after bereavement) and identified five main grief trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trajectory with persistent low levels of grief symptoms in relatives (n=670 (45%)) was called the low grief trajectory (LGT) and was used as reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high grief trajectory (HGT) consisted of 107 (6%) relatives with persistent high grief symptom levels. We investigated associations between grief trajectories and 1) contacts to general practitioner (GP) including out-of-hours using negative binomial regression analysis, 2) contacts to mental health services (GP talk therapy, private-practice psychologist or psychiatrist), 3) use of psychotropic medications (antidepressants, anxiolytics and sedatives) using logistic regression analysis, and 4) mortality using Cox regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The follow-up period started at three years after bereavement and long-term outcome were further followed until ten years after the patient’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives in the HGT had a significantly higher yearly incidence of GP contacts until seven years after bereavement compared to the LGT. The HGT was associated with higher use of mental health services (OR=2.86 (95%CI 1.58;5.19)), antidepressants (OR=5.63 (95% CI 3.52; 9.01)), sedatives and anxiolytics (OR=2.60 (95%CI 1.63;4.14)), and excess mortality (OR=1.88 (95% CI 1.1;3.2)) compared to the LGT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows that patients with high and sustained grief symptoms have an increased healthcare use up to ten years after loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should assess whether current health care services sufficiently meet the prolonged needs of these relatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:37:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1SX2FfRUhvNWYxUUg0UkJlaWJLdlhsa0dFYThjWlZVMFVYVm4takJlcmN4VFpsMi1HQ0NjT3hqOFZERnRteExNNV9jdkFJYlBkaUdTLXdUTUhFVnA0amxlcDIxa29rWTlRa0ln</guid></item><item><title>CRISPR可以通过编辑蚊子中的单个基因来阻止疟疾传播- Engadget | CRISPR can stop malaria spread by editing a single gene in mosquitos - Engadget</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPZ1F2b0JZcDhoZWFyZlRaQ2JkQndWQVpkOWZnRGxPbU1sSlV0MzBFbDNTYk8tSWhlSmxyU1BmV0tRVUppaDlUT3VGUzZ6YlVTdW5fWVpZamRCQWNQd05XdkFEajRwd25IVUVyZnZJT1RRajdWeWtNOUJBT0VRTnYyZll0MktDS0FucjNHNW1nQ21KSnYzekhwS2N5TUVsVGozeWdnVHUxeVUyYm5RX0lXc2V5Q0x0ZGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRISPR gene-editing therapy has shown &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2023-was-a-big-year-for-crispr-based-gene-editing-but-challenges-remain-160009074.html" data-ylk="slk:great potential;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;great potential&lt;/a&gt; to treat and even cure diseases, but scientists are now discovering how it can be used to prevent them as well.

These genetically modified mosquitos could eventually be released into the wild, helping prevent some of the 600,000 malaria deaths that occur each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitos infect up to 263 million people yearly with malaria and efforts to reduce their populations have stalled as late. That's because both the mosquitos and their parasites that spread malaria have developed resistance to insecticides and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, biologists from UC San Diego, Johns Hopkins and UC Berkeley universities have figured out a way to stop malarial transmission by changing a single amino acid in mosquitos. The altered mosquitos can still bite people with malaria and pick up parasites from their blood, but those can no longer be spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses CRISPR-Cas9 "scissors" to cut out an unwanted amino acid (allele) that transmits malaria and replace it with a benign version. The undesirable allele, called L224, helps parasites swim to a mosquito's salivary glands where they can then infect a person. The new amino acid, Q224, blocks two separate parasites from making it to the salivary glands, preventing infection in people or animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a single, precise tweak, we’ve turned [a mosquito gene component] into a powerful shield that blocks multiple malaria parasite species and likely across diverse mosquito species and populations, paving the way for adaptable, real-world strategies to control this disease," said researcher George Dimopoulos from Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous methods of malarial control, changing that key gene doesn't affect the health or reproduction capabilities of mosquitos. That allowed the researchers to create a technique for mosquito offspring to inherit the Q224 allele and spread it through their populations to stop malarial parasite transmission in its tracks. "We’ve harnessed nature’s own genetic tools to turn mosquitoes into allies against malaria," Dimopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="commerce-disclaimer default wider-padding"&gt;If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Engadget</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:30:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPZ1F2b0JZcDhoZWFyZlRaQ2JkQndWQVpkOWZnRGxPbU1sSlV0MzBFbDNTYk8tSWhlSmxyU1BmV0tRVUppaDlUT3VGUzZ6YlVTdW5fWVpZamRCQWNQd05XdkFEajRwd25IVUVyZnZJT1RRajdWeWtNOUJBT0VRTnYyZll0MktDS0FucjNHNW1nQ21KSnYzekhwS2N5TUVsVGozeWdnVHUxeVUyYm5RX0lXc2V5Q0x0ZGs</guid></item><item><title>大流行压力可能已经使您的大脑老化-即使没有感染- Earth.com | Pandemic stress may have aged your brain - even without infection - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQYV91QWpBX1BTRGV1LUY0NWJuZ2s1QjB1Nzg5Y051WmRKeXh0Qm1ZY0lQVXRHc3dsWFNUWVI3dEw4VW5qSG9tNDcwM0FRSUJaaXNoNXM1dXB4cWJPLW1oSmRhWE5DV0FteDVYZkZMM0JtVFlKNW9YMXJWNkt2bkNzcnZYWlh0dHdFZnd6OTlZRUtFT0xiV1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists watched the pandemic reshape hospitals, jobs, and politics, but a new set of brain scans hints that it also reshaped the organ inside our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were never infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed brains that looked a few months older than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that merely living through lockdowns, uncertainty, and social upheaval left a subtle neurological signature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a new investigation by Dr. Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad of the &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham’s School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pandemic-stress-aged-the-brain"&gt;Pandemic stress aged the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 1,000 healthy adults enrolled in the UK Biobank underwent two MRI sessions – one before March 2020. For half of them, a second scan took place between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used machine learning models built from 15,334 pre-pandemic scans to estimate each volunteer’s brain age gap, the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age. A positive gap means the brain appears older on imaging, a negative gap younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me most was that even people who hadn’t had Covid showed significant increases in brain aging rates,” said Mohammadi-Nejad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who weren’t infected but lived through the pandemic showed an average increase in brain age of about five and a half months compared to similar individuals who were scanned twice before 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age, male sex, and lower income made the acceleration steeper, demonstrating that biology and biography travel together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-accelerates-brain-aging"&gt;Stress accelerates brain aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds to a growing collection of research that links chronic stress hormones to faster structural decline in white matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated allostatic load, the body’s cumulative stress score, correlates with brains that look a year or two older than they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation compounds the problem. A study of 24,867 adults found &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/loneliness-harms-health-more-than-alcohol-obesity-or-smoking/"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and poverty were linked to higher brain age and worse physical health. Lockdowns amplified both stress and isolation, so a slight pandemic era uptick in brain age is biologically plausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support the idea. Rodents under constant stress show brain inflammation and damage in areas used to estimate brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infected-brains-show-more-decline"&gt;Infected brains show more decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 infection had its own costs. Participants who caught the virus took longer on the Trail Making Test (TMT), a timed task of mental flexibility, than both controls and pandemic peers who were never infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Japanese cohort &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563673/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; confirms that slower trail making times flag early cognitive change in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans of infected people elsewhere echo the pattern. A 2022 report comparing 401 infected volunteers with 384 controls found greater gray matter loss in orbitofrontal and parahippocampal regions, areas tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-your-brain-decides-what-smells-good-or-bad/"&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt; and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Nottingham analysis, only the infected subgroup linked larger brain age jumps with worse trail making scores, hinting that viral effects and stress effects overlap but are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-hits-the-vulnerable-harder"&gt;Stress hits the vulnerable harder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood, working an unstable job, or lacking higher education magnified the brain aging-signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment insecurity, for example, added almost six extra months to the gap compared with securely employed peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scans make visible a truth social scientists have charted for decades: financial strain and limited social capital seep into physiology. When economic cushions thinned during &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-19-lockdowns-weakened-our-immune-systems/"&gt;lockdowns&lt;/a&gt;, the impact may have sped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data support protecting vulnerable groups during crises, as stress leaves measurable effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-healing-depends-on-lifestyle"&gt;Healing depends on lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it’s certainly possible, and that’s an encouraging thought,” said Professor Dorothee Auer, senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain age models capture averages, not destinies. Earlier studies of stress recovery suggest that gray matter volume and brain connectivity can rebound when stress is reduced. Recovery is more likely when lifestyle factors like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-bursts-of-intense-exercise-can-slow-brain-aging/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and social contact improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer follow-ups will reveal whether the pandemic’s neural footprint fades, stays put, or predicts later cognitive trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the scans remind us that global emergencies do not end at the ICU door – they echo inside healthy brains, too, in ways only careful imaging can catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-scans-reveal-policy-impact"&gt;Brain scans reveal policy impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds weight to the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brains-age-might-be-older-than-you-are/"&gt;brain age&lt;/a&gt; could become a routine marker in population health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If small changes in daily life – or major global events – show up clearly on brain scans, public health leaders might one day use brain age metrics to evaluate policy impacts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also raises the question of how resilience works at a neural level. Some people weathered the pandemic with little psychological or neurological wear, while others showed sharper declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what protects brain health under chronic stress could shape future treatments or community interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:11:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQYV91QWpBX1BTRGV1LUY0NWJuZ2s1QjB1Nzg5Y051WmRKeXh0Qm1ZY0lQVXRHc3dsWFNUWVI3dEw4VW5qSG9tNDcwM0FRSUJaaXNoNXM1dXB4cWJPLW1oSmRhWE5DV0FteDVYZkZMM0JtVFlKNW9YMXJWNkt2bkNzcnZYWlh0dHdFZnd6OTlZRUtFT0xiV1E</guid></item><item><title>当您每天喝咖啡时，血糖会发生什么变化？ - Verywell Health | What Happens to Your Blood Sugar When You Drink Coffee Every Day? - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBaSFR4bUpneHp6ZWd0Rm9RLWNDQVN6MENJMDJ1alJvcjl6MTZwa0daeFo5N3JCaFhuVWxHOXJEdGp6YzlCZ3pmOTBjVG5keEZNdy1kWk1CZFJqeF9QX25sdXdzZXpvME0wQ3ZsTFYzS3JfMHRsdXUtRw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee may cause blood sugar to spike or fall.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It can. But it depends on the dose, your individual biology, and how and when you drink it.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also signals the liver to release stored glucose, making it harder for cells to absorb this excess glucose from the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Take note of whether you typically drink your coffee on an empty or full stomach. “Caffeine absorption rates are faster on an empty stomach,” said &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/candace-pumper" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Candace Pumper, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She added that rapid absorption can lead to more pronounced blood sugar spikes, especially if coffee is also loaded with added sugar or sweetened creamers. However, these effects are usually short-lived.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink coffee with or after food&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair your brew with a meal or snack to slow caffeine absorption and blunt &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/blood-sugar-spikes-5216913" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose unsweetened or naturally sweetened options:&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sugar-replacements-for-diabetics-1087191" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;natural sugar substitutes&lt;/a&gt; like stevia, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/monk-fruit-11734221" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;monk fruit&lt;/a&gt;, or allulose instead of sugar or flavored syrups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go half-caf or decaf:&lt;/strong&gt; Cut back on the caffeine content if you’re especially sensitive to it or already have insulin resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try coffee alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Black or green tea, dandelion root coffee, or even low-acid coffee may be gentler on blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your response: &lt;/strong&gt;Pay attention to how you feel when drinking coffee. If you wear a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/continuous-glucose-monitoring-the-arrival-of-dexcom-5-3289566" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;, you can also track how different types and timings of coffee affect you. Stick with whatever timing leaves you feeling at your best.&lt;/li&gt;

ROACH: I am a 74-year-old man. I have a DEXA score of -3.3. I take 1,200 mg of calcium with vitamin D daily. I lift weights and swim two to three times a week. My doctor put me on Prolia, and I had six months of infections. He switched me to Fosamax, and my blood pressure was 201/121 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E4YNBW75YREEJH56TI7ZC54EQI"&gt;I found a Phase 4 clinical trial showing that Fosamax can cause high blood pressure, but my doctor says that Fosamax “doesn’t cause high blood pressure.” I’m reluctant to try the other bisphosphonates for fear that they will do the same as Fosamax. Do I try the other drugs one at a time, or do you have a recommendation? -- D.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LHBWZVETVBEFLHGAXX4ALKG7NQ"&gt;ANSWER: Your doctor should have said that people taking alendronate (Fosamax) have the same rate of developing high blood pressure as people who are put on a placebo pill, which would have been a more accurate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YSNOWDJT7JAY3DYXQT553DV5SA"&gt;In the 12 months when subjects in a trial took alendronate, 1.9% developed high blood pressure -- about the same rate seen in a placebo group over the same time period. It’s unlikely that Fosamax caused your high blood pressure levels, but it is certainly possible that you are having a rare reaction, which happens to few enough people that it hasn’t yet been recognized. I hope your physician reported this as a possible adverse event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DSDE2G4NNFAG5M43XFTQDKYPBE"&gt;A T-score of -3.3 by a DEXA represents quite severe osteoporosis. When I see levels this low, I tend not to use denosumab (Prolia) or bisphosphonates, both of which work by preventing the osteoclast cells from reabsorbing bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RBJZ56YOHFDJBETRFORMMCAJT4"&gt;Prolia also has a theoretical risk of increased infections, and it seems that this might have been the case with you. Instead, I would consider a medicine that promotes bone growth, such as teriparatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T2BPXWHDFJHPFJEQO6MY2AWQ4I"&gt;Finally, I test all men with osteoporosis for low testosterone since it is a major risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I currently take several medications and supplements daily that are encapsulated in “dissolvable” plastic capsules. How much concern should I have regarding a large or dangerous buildup of microplastic particles in my body? -- G.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y4WQ4UVEXZEJLD7IZVLYYHNC74"&gt;ANSWER: Microplastics are tiny amounts of polymers that have been detected in human blood and organs. The primary source is in contaminated food and water, but microplastics can be inhaled as well. Bottled water is probably the single largest source of microplastics, with levels 20 times higher than tap water. Beer is the second most-common source, while air is third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A33IXK5UQBG6DB7WTXZGI4HAGI"&gt;The material that drug capsules are made from is most often gelatin, a plant protein. Starch, methylcellulose and polysaccharides may also be used. Plastic is almost never used, although I do know of a very few exceptions -- such as Procardia, where the shell of a capsule isn’t intended to be absorbed and is excreted intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VGXWEF4JTNFVBPACXOUL37Z6IA"&gt;You should not worry about your medications as a significant source of microplastics.

The new method, published in the scientific journal Science, demonstrates for the first time, that it is possible to design proteins in the computer for redirecting immune cells to target cancer cells through pMHC molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dramatically shortens the process of finding effective molecules for cancer treatment from years to a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are essentially creating a new set of eyes for the immune system. Current methods for individual cancer treatment are based on finding so-called T-cell receptors in the immune system of a patient or donor that can be used for treatment. This is a very time-consuming and challenging process. Our platform designs molecular keys to target cancer cells using the AI platform, and it does so at incredible speed, so that a new lead molecule can be ready within 4-6 weeks," says Associate Professor at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and last author of the study Timothy P. Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted missiles against cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI platform, developed by a team from DTU and the American Scripps Research Institute, aims to solve a major challenge in cancer immunotherapy by demonstrating how scientists can generate target treatments for tumor cells and avoid damaging healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, T cells naturally identify cancer cells by recognizing specific protein fragments, known as peptides, presented on the cell surface by molecules called pMHCs.It is a slow and challenging process to utilize this knowledge for therapy, often because the variation in the body's own T-cell receptors makes it challenging to create a personalized treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosting the body's immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers tested the strength of the AI platform on a well-known cancer target, NY-ESO-1, which is found in a wide range of cancers. The team succeeded in designing a minibinder that bound tightly to the NY-ESO-1 pMHC molecules. When the designed protein was inserted into T cells, it created a unique new cell product named 'IMPAC-T' cells by the researchers, which effectively guided the T cells to kill cancer cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was incredibly exciting to take these minibinders, which were created entirely on a computer, and see them work so effectively in the laboratory," says postdoc Kristoffer Haurum Johansen, co-author of the study and researcher at DTU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also applied the pipeline to design binders for a cancer target identified in a metastatic melanoma patient, successfully generating binders for this target as well. This documented that the method also can be used for tailored immunotherapy against novel cancer targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screening of treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crucial step in the researchers' innovation was the development of a 'virtual safety check'. The team used AI to screen their designed minibinders and assess them in relation to pMHC molecules found on healthy cells. This method enabled them to filter out minibinders that could cause dangerous side effects before any experiments were carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Precision in cancer treatment is crucial. By predicting and ruling out cross-reactions already in the design phase, we were able to reduce the risk associated with the designed proteins and increase the likelihood of designing a safe and effective therapy," says DTU professor and co-author of the study Sine Reker Hadrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years to treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Patrick Jenkins expects that it will take up to five years before the new method is ready for initial clinical trials in humans. Once the method is ready, the treatment process will resemble current cancer treatments using genetically modified T cells, known as CAR-T cells, which are currently used to treat lymphoma and leukemia.Patients will first have blood drawn at the hospital, similar to a routine blood test. Their immune cells will then be extracted from this blood sample and modified in the laboratory to carry the AI-designed minibinders. These enhanced immune cells are returned to the patient, where they act like targeted missiles, precisely finding and eliminating cancer cells in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"Therefore, 7,000 steps per day might be a more realistic and achievable recommendation for some, but 10,000 steps per day can still be a viable target for those who are more active.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More On Your Step Count From WH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-did-the-10000-number-come-from" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Where did the 10,000 number come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The famous steps goal number has a long history behind it (you can do a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="deep dive here" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;deep dive here&lt;/a&gt;). But here's a quick recap: This number was formulated by a Tokyo doctor named Iwao Ohya who created a fitness tracker called Manpo-Kei (in Japanese, that means "10,000 step meter) with engineer Jiro Kato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's been suggested that 10,000 steps was chosen because the Japanese character for 10,000 looks like a man running or walking, but it’s not really clear if that's truly one of the reasons behind the number. (Both inventors have since died.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The number 10,000 eventually got picked up by researchers and fitness tracker developers, and its popularity spread. These days, almost everyone knows the number. Still, "no clinical data backed it then, and none was added later," says Dani Singer, CPT, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.fit2gopt.com/" target="_blank" data-offer-url="http://www.fit2gopt.com/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="15.1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.fit2gopt.com/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fit2Go Personal Training." class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fit2Go Personal Training.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-not-accurate" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why is it not accurate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While hitting 10,000 steps isn't bad for you (and means you're moving a lot throughout the day) the exact number is pretty much made up. "It was a marketing campaign,” says Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SoHo Strength Lab" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “There wasn’t a scientific basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Matheny stresses that the 10,000 steps a day goal isn’t necessarily inaccurate from a health POV—but many people can get serious health perks between 5,000 to 7,000 steps a day. "The data show health gains level off well before 10,000," Singer says. "Mortality and cardiovascular risk improvements start at just 2,000. It's important to understand this so that you avoid an all-or-nothing mindset—especially one that isn't based on any actual data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If that's the number you like, and you hit it consistently, stick with it! But just remember: “10,000 steps per day is not the magic number," per Matheny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-how-many-steps-should-i-take-per-day" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;So, how many steps should I take per day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Based on the scientific review's findings, aiming for 5,000 to 7,000 steps a day is a good goal to reach for. That's roughly two to 3.5 miles per day, depending on your stride. “There’s nothing wrong with 10,000 steps, but it isn’t based in science,” Matheny says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you want to still aim for 10,000 steps, Matheny says you should go for it. “If you don’t get there, maybe you still get to 7,000,” he points out. But any amount of walking is helpful. “A thousand steps is way better than zero,” Matheny says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

As long as someone is eating high-quality proteins from any source, Dr. Erickson says their body will be able to make the collagen it needs on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides focusing on getting enough protein, Hayes and Dr. Erikson both say that vitamin C also plays a role in generating collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin C is part of the collagen matrix and a deficiency could lead to missing one of the key components the body needs to make collagen,” Hayes says, adding that there are many good sources of the nutrient (including citrus foods, tomatoes, and bell peppers) and that the vast majority of people in the US get enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three nutrition experts emphasized that there is no need to take a collagen supplement if someone is meeting their protein needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about all the claims about collagen helping to reduce wrinkles, improve joint health, or anything else you may come across? Hayes, Dr. Erikson, and Dr. Begdachne are all in agreement that upping the amount of protein you’re getting will have the same effects; if you’re getting enough protein, you don’t need to supplement with collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are studies out there showing different benefits of supplementing with collagen, but if you really look at them they are all flawed,” Dr. Erikson says. “They are either funded by a supplement company or they don’t use good control [guidelines]. Often, the placebo in collagen supplement studies is nothing. But the placebo should be another protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line? “There is no study showing that a collagen supplement is more beneficial than a high-quality diet,” Dr. Erikson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Still Want to Get a Collagen Supplement? Here’s What to Keep in Mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re still convinced that you need to stock up on collagen, there are a few tips the experts say to keep in mind. When shopping for collagen supplements or skin-care products, you will likely see the type of collagen referred to as marine or bovine. This, Dr. Begdache says, refers to how it was sourced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marine collagen comes from fish—the skin and bones are especially good sources—and bovine collagen comes from cows,” Dr. Begdachne says. In general, she says not to get too hung up on marine versus bovine collagen, but she says marine collagen does contain more type 1 collagen, which tends to be smaller and easier to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Type 1 collagen is what’s mostly found in skin, so if you are looking for a collagen product for skin health, marine would be a slightly better choice,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since supplements are not FDA-regulated, Dr. Erikson says that there is a risk of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially supplements sourced from animals, like collagen supplements, there is a risk of heavy metals,” he says. “The cow could have been exposed to lead or other metals in the soil from its food and fish can contain mercury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be safe, he recommends finding a supplement with a US Pharmacopeia (USP) seal, which indicates that it has been third-party tested for ingredient accuracy and is free of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen does play an important role in the body, but as long as you’re getting enough protein and vitamin C, it’s not something you have to worry about. This is one trend you don’t have to buy into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1ZYUlOZzdlZlJqdGFGaTNrbmxEX0ZMYmFteEd6Q1ZoMXdyMGRGMjhRVDBQclFndHJKb3ZrdkFQbm5nMExYNVl6UndrNy1BM1Btajg1Uktlb2VVRm80WFlvQWxmWQ</guid></item><item><title>只有一个瓶装水品牌不含微塑料—这项研究证明了这一点- The Daily Galaxy | Only One Bottled Water Brand Is Free of Microplastics — and This Study Proves It - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPeXRzMjU4NzNmT3JsWWs3cHB6RG1PdDVfXy1YcWhGWm9HQXlFdEpDY2ZSMmZTbXlBNVdUbGRZa3VnbFdrVGJxTVNQWjU4R05FSUJjdTFGSkg4NW9VUmFwSDlRMmxadUhwcDRwUmdwYlZCUzRnVy0yajVKeGRiSzB1OUt0cUNVNEtfZjlhTEZDMXhvamVydFhOZTBEdUlwRDVqWmJYYzhLUFlvX3B3czlfZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, people have started noticing that our surroundings are getting loaded with tiny bits of plastic. A study by researchers from Columbia University and Rutgers University—published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024—reveals some eye-opening findings about bottled water. This report challenges the idea that bottled water is a safer pick over tap water and makes us wonder about its effects on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unveiling the presence of microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found an average of 240,000 plastic fragments per liter in bottled water. Most of these particles are actually nanoplastics, with 90% measuring less than 1 micrometer; the other 10% fall into the microplastics range, between 5 millimeters and 1 micrometer. Given that such tiny pieces can slip into the bloodstream and possibly settle in organs like the heart and brain, the findings are quite concerning. Wei Min, a Columbia chemistry professor and co-author, noted, “The smaller they are, the easier it is to confuse them with natural cell components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nail down these results, the team used advanced techniques like stimulated Raman scattering microscopy paired with artificial intelligence. This method helped them pinpoint and sort seven different types of plastics in bottled water, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Beizhan Yan, a research professor at Columbia, mentioned that if a bottle has lots of PET bits, there tend to be fewer particles from other plastics used in water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sources and implications of contamination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study points to several origins for the plastic particles in bottled water. PET, a common material for making bottles, came up as a major source. But it wasn’t just the bottle itself—filtration and purification systems also seem to add plastic bits. This means that even thorough cleaning processes might accidentally introduce these small plastic bits into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, among all the brands tested, only one showed no sign of microplastics or nanoplastics. Although the study didn’t name the brand, it shows that making bottled water free from these tiny plastics is possible if strict filtration and packaging methods are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings make anyone who drinks bottled water every day rethink their options and wonder about the quality of what they’re consuming. They also point to the need for more studies on plastic contamination from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind this groundbreaking work isn’t stopping here. They plan to widen their research to tap water, packaged foods, and even human tissues to see just how widespread plastic particles really are. They’re also set to study how these particles affect development and the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beizhan Yan called this area “a dark, unexplored field,” noting that earlier toxicity tests were mostly guesses about plastic exposure levels. Now, with these new methods, there’s a chance to really understand how deeply microplastics have crept into our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we come to grips with these revelations about microplastics in bottled water, it’s clear that we need to reconsider our choices and push for better standards in how water is filtered and bottled. This study is a wake-up call, urging us all to look closer at what we’re drinking and to start moving toward cleaner alternatives that put our well-being first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center have discovered how a hormone interacts with a receptor on the surface of immune cells to shield cancer cells from the body's natural defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-025-02233-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, could lead to new immunotherapy approaches for treating cancer as well as potential treatments for inflammatory disorders and neurologic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Myeloid cells are among the first group of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/myeloid+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;myeloid cells&lt;/a&gt; get stimulated by this hormone and end up suppressing the immune system," said Cheng Cheng "Alec" Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. Dr. Zhang co-led the study with first author Xing Yang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Zhang Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current immunotherapies, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+checkpoint+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, are effective for only about 20–30% of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Zhang said, suggesting that there are multiple ways that cancers evade attack from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, researchers in the Zhang Lab studying cancer-fighting immune cells called myeloid cells identified an inhibitory receptor called LILRB4. Stimulating this receptor blocked the myeloid cells' ability to attack tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang, Dr. Yang and their colleagues then did a genome-wide screen of all proteins that might interact with LILRB4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising hit was a hormone called SCG2. Although researchers have suggested that SCG2 plays a role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt;, its function and receptor were unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory experiments confirmed that SCG2 binds to LILRB4, kicking off a signaling cascade that turned off the cancer-fighting abilities of myeloid cells and inhibited their ability to recruit cancer-fighting T cells to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice genetically altered to express the human form of LILRB4, injected &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; that produced SCG2 grew rapidly as tumors. Treating these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; with an antibody that blocks LILRB4 significantly slowed cancer growth, as did artificially ridding the animals' bodies of SCG2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these experiments suggest that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/interactions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;interactions&lt;/a&gt; between LILRB4 and SCG2 allow cancer to grow unchecked by myeloid cells, T cells, and potentially other immune cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang suggested that disrupting this interaction could someday offer a new immunotherapy option to treat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, because this interaction neutralizes myeloid cells' immune activity, delivering extra SCG2 could be a promising treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory disorders spurred by myeloid cells. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues plan to investigate both ideas in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

Health officials in Chicago issued a similar warning a few weeks earlier, as a batch of mosquitoes there had tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"With mosquito season underway in Illinois, it is now time for Illinoisans, especially seniors and those with weakened immune systems, to start taking precautions to prevent mosquito bites," said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra, according to Patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this announcement important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;West Nile can cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the virus can also be deadly. Illinois saw 69 human cases in 2024, including 13 deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://idph.illinois.gov/wnvpublic/wnvglance.aspx?year=2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:IDPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;IDPH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While West Nile has been in the U.S. since &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007186.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1999;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, a warming planet is driving increases in mosquito-borne illnesses. These bloodsuckers benefit from warmer and wetter conditions, which are helping them expand their ranges, remain active for longer seasons, and move into higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, a Massachusetts epidemiologist recently called people to alert after the state discovered its first West Nile-carrying mosquitoes two weeks earlier than last year. And Connecticut officials are warning residents that the type of tiger mosquito that carries chikungunya, Zika, and dengue is expected to spread farther and faster than usual across the state in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about mosquito-borne illnesses?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The IDPH is encouraging people to "fight the bite" to best avoid the potential of contracting West Nile. Recommendations include eliminating standing water, using screens on windows or doors or keeping them shut, wearing long clothing and an Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellent when outside, and reporting standing water if it has been present for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many communities are also looking for ways to reduce mosquito populations in their efforts to protect residents. For instance, officials in one Florida county are using X-rays to kill invasive mosquitoes, and one Manila neighborhood is paying residents to bring in any mosquitoes they can capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec3K1DcanxmvsGYh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTU90RzlTUmlSR2xmaTVLVXR2UVlqOTB0eTZ6SlV6Y3dqekhhZ3lRcjl0aGwzZTk0LWhSclI5MkFRN1dtVVFWbEczaUhrTXpLclJzTW9hZG90QW1abzNyaG9uVWU4RXVBU2xmaGpOcklIejlxcEZtZHpsME9VUlcyWS1DTGtaUUN4X2VQX1JpMEQ</guid></item><item><title>不再需要每天数到10000 -研究表明，健康益处相等，步数更少- Earth.com | No more counting to 10,000 every day - study shows equal health benefits in fewer steps - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWjVEX2pva0hzSGFrOEJIY2ZfSlJsZmQ1LTNMSE5LTW5wUnhqeEt4dlFzZnlISThvcUQ3MXVESWlJV2VOVTIzZ3l2dEpFVDZuaU9Zald0S3habU1WdG9abGtiS01USmJkVFY5cDJ4N3ZGc0JJb0paWllvNjlYMHZ1cEdlVzlaTDNLZ3JZbHU3TThIVjFZcm5fMlpqYjJaVGJhQndV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fitness tracker doesn’t care whether you run for the bus or wander through the grocery store. It simply counts. Those digital tallies have become a barometer of personal health and wellness, yet the “magic” 10,000-step goal that pops up on so many screens never came from a medical textbook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence now suggests that you can bank most of the same benefits with a target that feels far more doable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily movement is still critical. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cardiorespiratory-fitness-linked-to-greater-cognitive-performance/"&gt;Cardiorespiratory fitness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, and mood all improve when people spend less time sitting. The question has always been how much walking is enough to tip the scales toward better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sweeping review published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt; turns that puzzle on its head, offering a fresh benchmark that’s easier to reach for schoolchildren, office workers, and older adults alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-benefits-of-daily-steps"&gt;Health benefits of daily steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combing through data collected between 2014 and 2025 in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and several other nations, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; weighed information from fifty-seven studies that tracked step counts with pedometers, accelerometers, and popular wrist-worn sensors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/melody-ding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Melody Ding&lt;/a&gt; explains, “Aiming for 7,000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn’t been looked at before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis compared people who logged about 2,000 steps per day with peers who reached higher brackets in 1,000-step increments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that moving up to roughly 7,000 steps lowered the risk of dying from any cause by 47 percent, almost matching the advantage seen at 10,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-reveal"&gt;What the numbers reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking around 3½ miles a day also trimmed dementia risk by 38 percent, while an extra 3,000 steps beyond that shaved only seven additional percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; showed a different curve: incidence dropped 22 percent at 10,000 steps and 27 percent at 12,000. Importantly, the biggest jump in protection happened when people climbed from 2,000 to between 5,000 and 7,000 steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/katherine.owen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Katherine Owen&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s chief analyst, notes, “For people who are already active, 10,000 steps a day is great, but beyond 7,000 steps, the extra benefits for most of the health outcomes we looked at were modest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-gains-and-step-goals"&gt;Health gains and step goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review did more than tally deaths. Researchers linked a 7,000-step habit to lower odds of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, certain cancers, depression, and mobility problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes – including reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and depressive symptoms,” Professor Ding says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings back up earlier work showing that even light-intensity activity improves insulin sensitivity, blood-pressure regulation, and the release of brain-boosting neurochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moving-the-goalposts-again"&gt;Moving the goalposts (again)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did 10,000 steps take root in the first place? Historians trace the figure to a Japanese pedometer marketed in the 1960s under the name &lt;em&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/em&gt;, or “10,000-step meter.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketers rounded the idea into a neat slogan, and fitness culture never looked back. Science, however, keeps refining the target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pooling millions of person-years of follow-up, the Sydney team demonstrated that the curve of risk reduction begins to flatten once people cross 7,000 steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting higher numbers still helps, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;blood-glucose&lt;/a&gt; control, yet the incremental payoff shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-increases-big-payoffs"&gt;Small increases, big payoffs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most adults in high-income countries average fewer than 5,000 steps on workdays. That leaves substantial room for improvement without marathon ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ding reminds readers, “However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7,000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same principle holds for those edging toward retirement: replacing a couple of car trips each week with short walks or choosing stairs instead of elevators can push step totals into the protective zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-what-fits"&gt;Finding what fits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies have long advised at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, a metric many people find hard to translate into daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steps provide a simpler yardstick, and the Australian government is already exploring how to fold the new evidence into future guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also want to know whether age, chronic illness, or regional differences should tweak the threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;Step counters&lt;/a&gt; miss swimming and cycling, and most studies still overrepresent wealthier nations, so widening the research net will sharpen advice for diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-steps-and-the-future"&gt;Health, steps, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main lesson is one of progress rather than perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements,” Professor Ding concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stroll with the dog, an extra loop around the block during lunch, or pacing the sidelines at a child’s soccer game all add to the tally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross the 7,000-step mark most days, and you are likely protecting your heart, mind, and metabolic health. Go further if you enjoy it, but remember that the steepest gains come early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sneakers – and your body – will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266725001641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:08:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWjVEX2pva0hzSGFrOEJIY2ZfSlJsZmQ1LTNMSE5LTW5wUnhqeEt4dlFzZnlISThvcUQ3MXVESWlJV2VOVTIzZ3l2dEpFVDZuaU9Zald0S3habU1WdG9abGtiS01USmJkVFY5cDJ4N3ZGc0JJb0paWllvNjlYMHZ1cEdlVzlaTDNLZ3JZbHU3TThIVjFZcm5fMlpqYjJaVGJhQndV</guid></item><item><title>这8个常见习惯可能会增加您患痴呆症的风险- HuffPost | These 8 Common Habits Could Increase Your Risk Of Dementia - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOV1hlQzlKUnNTeHNzc0RnV2RhMU5ON1NXdUdkS2lvekV2UHpITGEtSi1SOWFTUkplVlFrN2lqdVI4WFZQdXpvS2VBZHNzemRtZjRSUjZpaXUxcW9fNmJ5TXF5QXdvdDNabnNXMFUxM28zd0ktc0xYUnZhUU1vdllvaDB5c3REOWlDelFnM2JMMzXSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0hWejhCQWE5cGhGdlBVc0paWE00aUFQUjZEMTdBaTVzaDJicTlOWUxyU09zWWt6bEZKX3ZkMkEwb09SMVB4MlE5N1BuNWxGN0ZXU3huRTFZRi1GNDFGYUstWkRpUkNhakJKV21sWkJPSmNEUkF2RFlDbV9mSXBqbzVySWlfZGN5QTdSNHoxVmpieHpaNEtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As folks grow older, many health fears come to mind.

A plant-based diet is also a good one to follow for brain health, Prather noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not managing other health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t shy away from managing your medical conditions, Prather said. Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol are dementia risk factors, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Really aggressively managing those risk factors is well established to be a way of reducing the risk of cognitive health dementia in the future,” Prather said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important for vascular risk factors like atrial fibrillation or high blood pressure or hyperlipidemia,” Ellison added. Doing so protects circulation, blood supply and oxygen supply to the brain, Ellison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important for the prevention of vascular dementia in particular, which happens &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="when blood flow" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;when blood flow&lt;/a&gt; is blocked to the brain.

Not making time for friends and family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to prioritize social connections, said Prather. “We know that loneliness and depression and isolation are exceptionally negative for health,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have impacts on cognition as well as mortality,” said Prather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is an epidemic among older adults, and has a mortality associated with it [that’s] similar to &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-loneliness-epidemic-what-is-to-be-done" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="moderate smoking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://weillcornell.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-loneliness-epidemic-what-is-to-be-done" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;moderate smoking&lt;/a&gt;,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your mind socially engaged is also an important way to stay cognitively engaged, Prather said, whether that’s by taking part in conversations or listening to stories from loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of recent research has found that alcohol is not good for your health. It can &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/your-body-on-alcohol-how-it-affects-your-heart-liver-weight-and-cancer-risk-goog_l_6776e00fe4b0b748756170d3" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="lead to" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6776e00fe4b0b748756170d3" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;lead to&lt;/a&gt; liver damage, increase your risk of certain cancers, and it’s also not good for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell people, if you’re having issues with your cognition or you’re worried about your memory, one of the first pieces of advice I’m going to give you is to reduce your alcohol use,” said Prather. Just like our body as a whole, the liver is aging and can’t handle alcohol the same way it could when you were 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other piece about alcohol is not only that, it’s a direct toxin (we increasingly know it increases risk for almost all cancers), but it can really disrupt sleep,” Prather said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you have a drink before bed, notice how it impacts your sleep, she suggested. And, as mentioned above, it’s important to get restorative sleep to reduce your dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 65, it’s recommended that folks have no more than one standard drink a day and no more than seven in a week, Prather noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The CDC recommends" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than two drinks each day for men and no more than one for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Halfpoint Images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint Images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Head injuries are associated with a higher dementia risk, which makes it important to wear a helmet when getting on your bike.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skipping out on exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ellison, it’s important to both live a generally active lifestyle and get in aerobic and other forms of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean walking to do your errands instead of driving while also making plans to go to a workout class or go for a bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s recommended that older adults exercise 30 minutes aerobically, five days a week, but only about 10% of those over 75 meet that level of activity,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good for your cardiovascular health, which, as mentioned above, is also good for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prather added that fitness is something you should be prioritizing no matter your age and, “well before any cognitive changes happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Not wearing a helmet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things I tell my patients is, if you’re bicycling, wear a helmet,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been a huge number of observational studies linking head injury to dementia,” Henderson added. There is a consistent association that head injuries likely do play a role in dementia risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How large of a role does it play in someone’s dementia risk? “The answer might be that it doesn’t play a huge role at a population level, but on an individual level, it’s probably really important,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Ignoring depressive symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a psychiatrist, of course I want to shine a little light on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-advice-from-therapists_l_680fb468e4b049bc73d5d165" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="depression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="680fb468e4b049bc73d5d165" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,” Ellison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While severe depression isn’t as common in older adults when compared to younger adults, both severe depression and low-grade depressive symptoms can disrupt the things that are important for cognitive health such as socialization, exercise, self-care and diet, Ellison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, treatment of depression may be one way of improving cognitive aging,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia rates are decreasing and it may be due to some of these lifestyle habits — but if someone does develop dementia, it’s not their fault.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of people with dementia is increasing. I think everyone is aware of that. But it’s increasing in part because the number of people living to a very old age is increasing,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most dementia happens in older folks, Henderson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, on the bright side, “if you look at the actual chance of getting dementia at a particular age, it’s actually come down slightly, not a whole lot, but slightly, and it seems to parallel advances in taking care of cardiovascular health,” Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also now disease-modifying FDA-approved medications for the most common form of dementia, which is Alzheimer’s, said Ellison, who stressed that it’s important to start these medications early on in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it important to talk to your doctor if you do notice that you have cognitive challenges such as &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="frequently misplacing items" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;frequently misplacing items&lt;/a&gt;, memory changes that disturb your life or have trouble solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Forget the usual strolls—there’s a game-changing activity that combines cardio, coordination, and community in one fun package.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49428"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="A_low-impact_high-reward_activity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A low-impact, high-reward activity&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget watching my friend Martin, 62, gingerly step onto the court for the first time. Within minutes he was darting side to side, laughing as he chased the small plastic ball. Unlike jogging, this sport is gentle on the joints while still delivering a serious &lt;strong&gt;aerobic &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/musculation-a-jeun/" data-type="post" data-id="49395"&gt;workout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—perfect for bodies that creak more than they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Pickleball_the_unexpected_champion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Pickleball: the unexpected champion&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, pickleball has surged in popularity among those aged 60 and up. Played with a paddle and perforated ball on a badminton-sized court, it blends elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. According to the American Heart Association, players can burn up to &lt;strong&gt;500 calories in an hour&lt;/strong&gt;, all without the pounding you get from running. Best of all, the compact court keeps you moving in short bursts, improving agility, balance, and hand-eye coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pickleball offers a remarkable balance of cardiovascular and muscular engagement,” says Dr. Emily Carter, a sports medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic. “It’s ideal for older adults looking to maintain health without overexertion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Starting_off_gear_technique_and_community"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Starting off: gear, technique, and community&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting started is as simple as grabbing a paddle, a pair of court shoes, and finding a local club. Many community centers offer beginner clinics—last month, my neighbor Joan signed up for her first lesson and was hooked immediately by the social aspect. Beginners often worry about the rules, but most clubs encourage a “no-pressure” environment where newcomers rotate in and out of games until they’re comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gear tip: Look for a paddle with a slightly larger sweet spot to reduce mishits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technique tip: Focus on your serve—a gentle underhand toss keeps the ball in play longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community tip: Join a weekly mixer; the camaraderie is half the fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Beyond_the_court_mental_and_social_perks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Beyond the court: mental and social perks&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the physical benefits are clear, don’t overlook the mental stimulus—strategy, quick decisions, and friendly rivalries all sharpen the mind. Plus, sharing laughs over a game or two combats isolation, a common challenge after retirement. As the International Council on Active Aging reports, group sports can boost mood and reduce stress, making pickleball a true all-around tonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re chasing a fast serve or simply craving a new way to connect, &lt;strong&gt;pickleball&lt;/strong&gt; stands out as the best sport after 60. It’s not just about staying fit; it’s about rediscovering joy in movement and friendship. Ready to give it a swing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Chicago Audible</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOczdwZGg2enVJUF82UzdNNE9VNjJScksxeXdIYk5LNjFvVkNMWUgwZmlOZmZDWjdmamFGS19fVG9FSVhvUVRqMHJBeVVnUm5VZzhCN2tsOWwtVVhZb3pwTUlpRHUyMi1XaUozTW5TNVZIZjN3bGhoMDBGWWhTSEI4VEd4bjZnLVpYY3NDZWJrQQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
