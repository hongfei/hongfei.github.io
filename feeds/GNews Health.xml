That’s not breaking news. Sugars and artificial flavors &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lack quality nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. So, many people reach for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;diet soda&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s not so healthy either. Recent research found that even &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/08/soda-diet-liver-disease-study-research/86579096007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;just one can of diet soda&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/12/can-you-get-diabetes-from-eating-too-much-sugar/71764449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; disease. Regular soda, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Yet, many Americans are addicted to fizzy drinks. And for those who wish to stop, cutting soda cold-turkey might not be a good idea — as some USA TODAY journalists &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/29/soda-health-side-effects-quitting-caffeine/86585472007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;recently learned&lt;/a&gt; when we tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People are struggling to stop even though they really want to,” explains Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. “You go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s because soda &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/12/soda-addiction-science-sugar-caffeine/86963258007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;appeals to our brain’s instinctual desire&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/20/is-corn-syrup-bad-for-you/71848699007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sugars&lt;/a&gt; and fats that help us survive — and our bodies adapt to increasingly high exposure to these ingredients over time, raising tolerance and making quitting painful, Gearhardt explains. You may get headaches, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/31/why-am-i-so-angry-all-the-time/83835896007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;irritability&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to think about it as if you were quitting smoking,” Gearhardt says. “You need to know what are your cues? What are your triggers? What emotions set you off? Certain times of day? Certain people? … Then you can come up with plans for a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alternative that’s right for you has a lot to do with why you’re drinking soda in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Here's how to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The best soda alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If people want caffeine, switching to coffee without sweetener is much healthier,” Gearhardt says, but she gives one warning: “Getting caffeine through soda gives energy much faster. You may not get as intense of a caffeine hit from coffee, so there might be a little bit of grieving … but that’s because we weren’t supposed to be getting that in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Morning headache? You can also try over-the-counter medications that contain a bit of &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, says Jennifer Temple, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Laboratory at the University of Buffalo. If you’re using soda to address a chronic medical issue, such as &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/21/why-does-my-head-hurt/85661258007/?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=deeperdive&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good idea to consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/05/28/is-green-tea-good-for-you-health-benefits-every-day/70244800007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tea is a good option&lt;/a&gt; for a later-in-the-day &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt; as it generally contains less caffeine than coffee. And if you can’t stand the taste of coffee or tea, remember there are many varieties and flavors to try – and either of these beverages with a bit of natural sweetener or &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/01/is-milk-good-for-you/82639148007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; is going to be better for you than soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/09/25/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/70823544007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says to try seltzer or non-sweetened &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/26/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/86335041007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt; "in the periods you would be going for a soda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love soda for the taste, Temple suggests making “spa water” flavored with lemon, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/08/are-cucumbers-good-for-you/83973776007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/17/what-is-ginger-beneficial-for/84468526007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt;, mint, basil or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/22/are-mandarin-oranges-good-for-you/85670307007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fresh ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Electrolyte powders, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/25/is-apple-juice-good-for-you/85253328007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt; and kombucha also substitute sweetness and &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/04/12/can-dehydration-cause-high-blood-pressure/11634018002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;quench thirst&lt;/a&gt;, but be careful of sneaky high sodium amounts or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/13/is-erythritol-safe/71485440007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;When soda is your best bet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Soda is OK to use as an alcohol replacement because most people usually only drink alcohol at certain times or in certain settings anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If it’s an occasional thing, there is flexibility,” Gearhardt says. Like we do with alcohol, set up “no soda zones,” such as your work area to reduce the number of hours and places you could potentially drink a soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you want to swap out soda at your next happy hour, check out &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/11/what-is-a-mocktail/84044261007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt;, zero-proof &lt;a href="/story/money/2025/09/25/beer-companies-health-concerns-alcohol/86299088007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/03/can-alcohol-cause-cancer-surgeon-general/77430536007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; or alcohol-free liquors, Temple says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;If you can't quit soda...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When in doubt, Gearhardt says use your common sense: What is the lowest-sugar option you have at any place and time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And when stopping soda has you feeling down, Gearhardt says to remember this is about prioritizing wellbeing. It’s not “quitting,” she says, it’s “getting healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you’re not ready to ditch soda altogether, that’s OK. Eliminating just one soda per day can make a major health impact, Temple says: “View it more like a treat than a daily habit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQeEZ4cXZkUWVrU0czaXJEb252ZDFBM004UmdKVW1xYzl1bnp3dm5HTzZSd1BCVkIwelpPM3ZTQnM5NDNMSk82bzdZbi1nRF84UUhjZHFkcmtjbXViTVNsTzlSZ1A1Z3pBVmZUU1R0d0xSbXJNNldPU3RGQ0g1ekladl9LY2tSR2pneVR5NE5lNXdPOVc3Yks2ZDZFNkQ1dXBFazBibXdxSmg</guid></item><item><title>当扫描显示新的风险细节时，对化妆品面部填充物的警告- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c773n331055o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Warning over cosmetic face fillers as scans reveal new details of risks&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;Digital health editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A close-up of a woman's face, side on, getting an injection of filler into the skin surrounding her lips.

The virus, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-282263" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite its success, the hepatitis B vaccine has become the latest target of skeptics who question whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-664094" class="body-graf"&gt;A vaccine given on “day one has a risk of neonatal fever, which causes more interventions” like blood work to determine the cause of the fever, said Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who practices at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c49b14" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since June, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired all of its members&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with his own appointees. On Monday, Milhoan was named the new ACIP chair, replacing Martin Kuldorff, a biostatistician who &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-appointed-cdc-vaccine-panel-says-will-scrutinize-childhood-vac-rcna214941" target="_blank"&gt;previously cast doubt on childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including the one for hepatitis B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4096bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he has never seen a serious reaction after “thousands of babies” have been given the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e52e33" class="body-graf"&gt;“I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,” O’Leary said at a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bddc" class="body-graf"&gt;And a review of more than 400 studies found no evidence that the birth dose of the vaccines causes any short- or long-term health problems. On the contrary, the review of research, published Tuesday by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/groups-organize-form-unbiased-independent-vaccine-panel-rcna212468" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of experts led by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, found that giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine has prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations. The paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478148" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday. The committee makes recommendations to the CDC director, who can then choose whether to adopt them. While a vote against newborn vaccination does not prohibit doctors from administering the shot, the panel’s recommendations influence insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41d92" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the ACIP members would vote to eliminate or delay that first dose of a hepatitis B vaccine by a month or two. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda posted online as of Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; described the meeting in broad strokes, offering no details about who would be presenting data. A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;vote on the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to take place at an ACIP meeting in September, but it was tabled because of confusion among committee members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e92349" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and sharing drug paraphernalia, such as needles. It can also pass from person to person if they share common household items such as toothbrushes or razors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79ce28" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan said any decision to give newborns hepatitis B vaccines should be made based on clinicians’ individual assessments of the babies’ risk for infection — that is, whether a pregnant woman tests positive for the infection or has a “questionable infectious disease background.” At September’s ACIP meeting, the panel voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3674af" class="body-graf"&gt;But not all pregnant women receive prenatal care, and if they do, not all feel comfortable speaking frankly with their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14553c" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan appeared to dismiss the argument that women may not divulge activities that could increase their risk for hepatitis B because of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74bf85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I hope they love their baby more than they love their pride,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e56dd" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2738558" target="_blank"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; showed that just 84% to 88% of pregnant women are tested for the virus. Without vaccination, 90% of babies exposed to the hepatitis B virus during birth develop chronic hepatitis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/#:~:text=Newborns%20infected%20with%20hepatitis%20B,will%20die%20from%20the%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f0b12" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine is not the only immunization Milhoan has cast doubt on. He is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance — formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance — a group that has advocated for unproven treatments for Covid. His &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the IMA’s website&lt;/a&gt; says he “is dedicated to treating patients affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, Long Covid, and vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.” Last year, he participated in an &lt;a href="https://crescentcitytimes.com/special-event-covid-hearings/" target="_blank"&gt;event with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt;, R-Ga., about alleged injuries associated with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b55413" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been especially critical of Covid vaccines for their link to a small but increased risk of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/heart-issues-common-covid-infection-vaccination-cdc-reports-rcna21558" target="_blank"&gt;heart condition called myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; in young men. The link was not seen in clinical trials; it was detected in 2021, soon after the shots were made available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae0a52" class="body-graf"&gt;“The rates of myocarditis were much higher than anyone thought,” Milhoan said. He said he was labeled an “anti-vaxxer” for speaking out about the potential risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191097" class="body-graf"&gt;“People were saying, ‘Are you against the vaccines?’ I’m just trying to show you what we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a085c" class="body-graf"&gt;Over the weekend, Dr. Vinay Prasad, the vaccine chief at the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccines-children-deaths-rcna246437" target="_blank"&gt;told staff members in a memo that an internal review&lt;/a&gt; found that at least 10 children died “after and because of” Covid vaccines and suggested the deaths were tied to myocarditis. Prasad did not provide any evidence to back up the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d25dfc" class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have shown that myocarditis is more commonly associated with Covid infection than vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c47b3" class="body-graf"&gt;This week’s ACIP meeting is also expected to include discussion of the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. The ingredient is added to prompt the immune system to react better to vaccines. A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;study of more than 1 million people&lt;/a&gt;, published over the summer, found that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum adjuvants were not linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15d89e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The meeting follows months of upheaval within the CDC, including mass firings and significant changes to its messaging. On Nov. 19, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC webpage&lt;/a&gt; that once stated unequivocally that vaccines do not cause autism &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;was rewritten&lt;/a&gt; to suggest, without evidence, that health officials had “ignored” possible links between the shots and the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVFJVVnhlMFlzUXk3dGsyTmxPQWdWSFZ4SHdJZm9acGtVX3Z6cmdoS3M4YnYxRE85TERBVXJBVnpUNE1OQUJDVlkwNjk3bWIzZGx4bkF3MGkzcjFwMThzZ2djZTRGSlpDRV96cHd3TGg1b2FHNnBLZzlrOUZVdHNTX1hQRVhQd190NzhfUkVJTUgzVWZmcXFHRmJlQWNkSWZ1blVZbmo3MDItWnNHOG9XeHpHLTJIV0ZRVWfSAVZBVV95cUxQR2FBRFhLLTZsbkhhYUtlQXlBTXJmd0ZqQ29fSE9yeG9VaTRIc2N5TXkxbmFlelVQZEw3OVpfaktWQ3pKaTZLRTlpdm8yMWd5UHYzX0JqUQ</guid></item><item><title>医生警告推迟为新生儿注射乙型肝炎疫苗可能会重现致命的威胁- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5629005/acip-hepatitis-b-rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-liver-failure-newborns</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Working out of a &lt;a href="https://anmc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tribal-owned hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon can still hear his voice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'" he recalled. "We were all crying." The boy died at home a week later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article/11/5/446/180718/Improving-Timeliness-of-Hepatitis-B-Vaccine-Birth" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;90% effective&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;98% of them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/ask-experts/topic/hepb/vaccine-recommendations-hepb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;30 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12549388/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the number of cases plummeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Liver cancer has disappeared in children," McMahon said. "We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Pushing Back the Dose?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to discuss and vote on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a "likely culprit" of autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He also said the hepatitis B virus is not "casually contagious." But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades of research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;up to states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to do that. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/29/nx-s1-5624998/fda-vaccines-covid-children-safety" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changes to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/3042d15c-676b-48ac-8148-1a2204ef420e.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;internal agency emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Prasad questioned the routine practice of "giving multiple vaccines at the same time." It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birth dose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Contacted for comment, Health and Human Services spokesman Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement that "ACIP will review the evidence at its meeting this week and issue recommendations based on gold standard, evidence-based science and common sense."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Sowing Distrust'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-debate-cdc-birth-dose-exposure-risk-acip-vote/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/media/HepBSexualHealth.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more infectious&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3973412/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study in the 1970s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a very infectious virus," McMahon said. "That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The three-dose vaccine has a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long track record&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2004/07000/lack_of_association_between_hepatitis_b_birth.12.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2001/11000/safety_of_neonatal_hepatitis_b_vaccine.9.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever or sepsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571612" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17192842/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autoimmune conditions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and severe reactions are rare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have an incredible safety profile," O'Leary said. "No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%202%20people%20with%20hepatitis%20B%20do%20not%20know%20they%20are%20infected." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;do not know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few to no symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure. Treatment can sometimes involve &lt;a href="https://www.hepatitisb.uw.edu/go/hbv/medications-used-to-treat-hbv/core-concept/all" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antiviral or immunomodulatory medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if the benefits outweigh the risk of severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Expert's Advice to Parents: Talk to a Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some parents may struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors, said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those perceptions, Schaffner said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280122/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;liver cancer reduced by 84%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver," Schaffner said. "It's too late to prevent that infection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;More hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;main adverse events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile — for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The data are so clear about this," Schaffner said. "A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; , a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82ddi002s26ql51qg055j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US stillbirth rate dropped 2% last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr041.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a hopeful improvement after a turbulent few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00043b6n8fqne0ai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there were still nearly 20,000 fetal deaths in 2024, CDC data shows, more than 5.4 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00053b6nwq61i6qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That rate is the lowest it’s been in decades, but the CDC does not necessarily consider it to be a record low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip8gck300013b6qen7u96rx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stillbirths have been generally trending down in the US: The rate fell from 7.5 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks in 1990 down to 5.7 in 2019. But the rate ticked up in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and has fluctuated in the years since, and the decline in 2024 essentially brought the stillbirth rate back to where it was in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00063b6nygmi65g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC report, the decline in the stillbirth rate last year was driven by significant change in three states: Colorado, which had a 14% drop; Utah, which had a 16% drop, and Mississippi, which saw a 21% drop in fetal mortality between 2023 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00073b6n40oe2uyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the decrease, Mississippi still has a higher stillbirth rate than any other state, at 7.8, but officials in the state are taking action. Earlier this year, Mississippi declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/infant-mortality-public-health-emergency-mississippi"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; over the rising infant mortality rate. The move creates opportunities to mobilize resources to address the issue, such as investments to activate a standardized system for maternal and infant care and eliminate &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/health/maternity-care-crisis-march-of-dimes"&gt;maternity care deserts&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00083b6nlr9smvbk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And despite the nationwide improvement last year, especially in stillbirths during the third trimester, experts say much more work is needed to continue to bring the stillbirth rate down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00093b6nud32n68x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Stillbirths affect just as many families as do infant deaths each year,” said Ashley Stoneburner, director of applied research and analytics with March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000a3b6nv0y97th3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a really large problem, and a lot of the risk factors that we see for infant mortality, especially very early infant deaths, are the same that we see for babies that are born still,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000b3b6n9teidlpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In September, the US National Institutes of Health launched a five-year, $37 million &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-consortium-reduce-risk-stillbirth-us" target="_blank"&gt;Stillbirth Research Consortium&lt;/a&gt; to support efforts that reduce the risk of stillbirth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000c3b6nn95vcan0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5785410/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that about a quarter of stillbirths are preventable, but most — up to 60% – “remain unexplained even after exclusion of common causes, such as congenital abnormalities, genetic factors, and obstetric complications,” NIH said in a news release about the new consortium.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000d3b6ns3vgsdif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ​Other factors that increase the risk for stillbirth include medical conditions among mothers — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and substance use during pregnancy — as well as high levels of stress some environmental exposures including extreme heat and pollution, Stoneburner says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000e3b6n4ar9d3r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of socioeconomic factors that increase the risk for stillbirth as well, and those are things like lack of access to health care or belonging to a certain ethnic minority groups,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000f3b6nniwqji6j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            March of Dimes’ 2025 report card highlighted a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/prenatal-care-us-women-march-of-dimes"&gt;worrisome decline&lt;/a&gt; in the share of pregnant women who are receiving prenatal care in their first trimester and “persistent inequities and rising health risks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000g3b6nobmaf1uc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new CDC report shows that stillbirth rates have been consistently highest among mothers who are Black and those who are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Rates of about 10 fetal deaths for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks for these groups are twice as high as they are among mothers who are Asian, White or Hispanic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The rise of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro has been nothing short of meteoric. Originally developed to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs are now widely used for weight loss and have become household names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alongside headlines of dramatic transformations are reports of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and unwanted pregnancies after contraception failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the risks? And what should you do if you are taking these medicines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-babies-heres-why-oral-contraceptives-might-be-failing"&gt;'Ozempic Babies': Here's Why Oral Contraceptives Might Be Failing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these drugs work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs are medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. They work by reducing blood sugar levels and reducing appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five medicines in this category are approved for use in Australia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounjaro (tirzepatide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wegovy (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxenda (liraglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trulicity (dulaglutide).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs have been around for the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/artg/217965"&gt;past decade&lt;/a&gt; but rose in popularity in recent years, with the help of Hollywood celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects of GLP-1 medicines are related to &lt;a href="https://www.ozempic.com/how-to-take/side-effects.html"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, stomach pain and constipation. These tend to be mild and either go away with time or become more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more concerning side effects have prompted Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety-monitoring-and-information/safety-alerts/product-warnings-updated-glp-1-ra-class"&gt;issue new warnings this week&lt;/a&gt; about suicidal thoughts and the lower effectiveness of oral contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 12 months to November 2025, there were 20 cases of suicidal thoughts reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/adverse-events/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen"&gt;Australian Database of Adverse Events Notifications&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with the use of a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with published scientific data. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75965-2"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found a link between GLP-1 medicines and a 106% increase in the risk of suicidal behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.23385"&gt;World Health Organization data&lt;/a&gt; also found a link between semaglutide use and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg" alt="crying woman" class="wp-image-183989 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Links between suicidal thoughts and GLP-1 drugs have been found in a number of studies, though others have found the opposite effect. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEAMO031Cg/"&gt;Karola G/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the evidence supports a link between GLP-1 drugs and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the data of more than 1.8 million patients who were taking the medicines for either weight loss or diabetes. It found a lower, not higher, risk of new or recurring suicidal thoughts when compared with patients who were not taking a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can these drugs affect contraception?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral contraceptives work by using hormones to prevent the release of eggs from the ovaries and to thicken the cervical mucus. This latter effect makes it difficult for sperm to reach and fertilise an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are only triggered when pregnancy-related hormones are at a high enough level. If GLP-1 medicines affect how the body absorbs hormones in oral contraceptives, hormone levels may not reach concentrations high enough to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers first raised the potential for GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability of GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives may vary between drugs. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that examined the link between tirzepatide and oral contraception found that this specific drug had a higher impact on hormone absorption when compared with other GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg" alt="pills" class="wp-image-183991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some GLP-1 drugs may impact the absorption of hormones in oral contraceptive drugs. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEVhT8CjDo/"&gt;Olga Niekrasova/The Olga Niekrasova Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of semaglutide published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.443"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; found the drug did not affect the amount of hormone that was absorbed into the body when patients were given the commonly used oral contraceptive pills ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a more recent study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S506957"&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt; concluded that both tirzepatide and oral semaglutide were able to affect oral contraceptive hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs should not affect the efficacy of IUDs or other long-acting (implanted) contraceptives, as they are not reliant on hormones being absorbed from the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I'm taking one of these drugs, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TGA recommends that if you're taking GLP-1 medicines, you should tell your doctor if you experience new or worsening  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, suicidal thoughts, or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women taking the GLP-1 drug tirzepatide and oral contraceptives, the TGA advises either switching to a non-oral contraceptive (like an implant) or adding a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the GLP-1 medicine, or any time you increase the dose of tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GLP-1 drug should not be used during pregnancy, as it &lt;a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2025/223/7/incidence-glp-1-receptor-agonist-use-women-reproductive-age-attending-general"&gt;may affect fetal growth&lt;/a&gt;. The adverse events database has also reported cases of miscarriages in women who were at the time taking semaglutide or tirzepatide.

            George Mycock’s fitness routine had gotten out of hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The 22-year-old was terrified of putting on body fat but eager to develop more muscle. He tracked his food so thoroughly that he was weighing lettuce leaves. And he was exercising –– way too much, in fact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If I halved it, I’d still probably be doing the same, if not more, than what anyone else I knew who was going to the gym,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000a3b6n1og35dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as he worked, he never felt satisfied. On the contrary, he often felt like he just didn’t have the discipline or character to reach his ever-changing body goals. He felt like a loser.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000b3b6nvtblvfxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then he found himself pulling away from his friends at university and increasingly believing people would be better off without him, he said. He was experiencing suicidal thoughts when a friend dropped by unexpectedly to check on him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000c3b6ndlhixj90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just started crying in front of her … I just told her how awful I felt,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000d3b6nnmjpfi5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That was the breakthrough moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000e3b6n3ziiq2ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the time, I didn’t really know that it was necessarily about my body or about the eating. I just knew that I felt horrendous. I just thought I was pathetic loser. And she convinced me to get help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000f3b6nwaxh6t07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock has never received a formal diagnosis for the condition –– he only knows of one person who has. But seven years later, as a researcher in the field and doctoral student at the University of Worcester in the United Kingdom, he understands his experience as muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called “bigorexia.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000g3b6nfx25d202@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle dysmorphia occurs when an individual becomes obsessed with becoming muscular,” said Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. Nagata is lead author of a review on the condition published in The Lancet Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Health Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000h3b6nqa9jul0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is often unrecognized and behaviors that go with it can even be praised, but the condition isn’t just about vanity, Mycock said. It is a mental health condition that can have serious consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000i3b6nomvek5ew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This type of dysmorphia can include extreme exercise behaviors, concern about being “scrawny” even if a person is objectively muscular, and the use of performance- or appearance-enhancing drugs, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000j3b6nzdd5olmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is considered part of a family of eating and body image disorders that are often stereotyped as being restricted to thin, White, young women. But they can happen to anyone – and sometimes they go unnoticed because they can resemble behaviors society praises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000k3b6nkdj13zup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In moderation, exercise is healthy, and the goal is to find activities that feel enjoyable and sustainable over the long term,” Nagata said. “But with muscle dysmorphia, workouts can shift from something positive to something that causes more stress than joy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000l3b6nvcqcmm47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people, especially young men, find joy and community at the gym when they go to get fit, but some people can take it too far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000m3b6no00oo1pz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead of looking forward to a workout, people with muscle dysmorphia may feel compelled to go because they worry about missing a session. Building muscle may start to get in the way of work, school or their relationships, Nagata said. People with this condition also may withdraw from social events or their usual activities because of concerns over their appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000n3b6n3hnic70e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When exercise starts to take over your life rather than support it, that’s a warning sign,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000o3b6nnzx7jdmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dominance of exercise over a person’s life is not without consequence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000p3b6nphqqwif3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is linked with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, substance use, and sometimes suicide risk, Nagata said. And the performance-enhancing drugs –– like anabolic steroids –– can have health consequences on the brain, such as irritability, aggression and paranoia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000q3b6nht32tgds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overexercise can lead to muscle or joint injuries, as well, he said. Steroid use can also damage the kidneys and liver and increase heart disease risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000r3b6ny6nowulp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is hard to tell when a desire to be muscular tips over into a disorder, because many people get the cultural message that appearance is important for social status and dating opportunities, said Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000s3b6nsitbxb6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a lot of young people, they think that their body needs to look a particular way in order to succeed,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000t3b6nxj4qq219@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boys and young men in particular are at risk for muscle dysmorphia because of the specific societal pressures put on their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000u3b6n823pglfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most boys and then have generally higher drive for muscularity overall, like they want to go to the gym. They want to be more muscular based on sort of the ideal male body,” Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000v3b6na33gz1s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weightlifting and body building increase the risk, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000w3b6nayach3sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Competitive athletes are especially vulnerable, and the risk is even higher when training is focused on changing appearance rather than improving performance,” he said. “Those pressures around physique can make certain athletes more susceptible to developing unhealthy or obsessive relationships with their bodies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000x3b6nm5aytseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock’s problem with fitness began when he injured his spine playing rugby at 13 and had to miss a year of school to recover. When he returned, he noticed his peers weren’t treating him the same. People who would talk with him when he was in a smaller, more muscular body suddenly were not speaking with him as much, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000y3b6nqwnfe0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when he started trying to lose weight, he found that he got more praise, to the point where his back surgeon joked about him coming in to teach other patients how to do it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000z3b6ncz19sznt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But little did he know that I was, at that point, basically starving myself and exercising multiple times a day,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00103b6n632nwdeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only was Mycock’s relationship with his body tied up with his identity as an athlete, but ideas of masculinity were at play, too, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00113b6nkdtpsikt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fitness influencers he followed online spread the message that anyone could achieve the ideal masculine body if only they worked hard enough, were disciplined enough and were man enough, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00123b6ngkn7kkoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the stricter Mycock got with his diet and exercise, the farther the goalpost moved.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00133b6nyr7xszd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every time I managed to meet the thing that I was aiming at, my brain said, ‘OK, this is now a thing that I can do, therefore it’s not good enough, and I need to do more,’” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00143b6ndkcllpvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It makes sense, because social media use is associated with muscle dissatisfaction and steroid use, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00153b6na3yml769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Boys’ bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts,” he added in an email. “Boys scroll through an endless feed of hyper-muscular, ultra-lean physiques, often heavily filtered or selected from hundreds of shots, which creates a constant pressure to measure up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00163b6np1ethllp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Mycock couldn’t reach the always far-off destination of the ultimate, masculine body, the message he received was that he just wasn’t good enough as a person, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00173b6nzt8v02yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a lot that researchers don’t know about muscle dysmorphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00183b6n9ncj9z21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data on the prevalence is limited, but two studies in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33722325/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%203%2C618%20Australian%20adolescents%20found,to%20report:%20*%20Severe%20preoccupation%20with%20muscularity" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11916914/" target="_blank"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; estimate that 2% to 3% of boys meet the criteria for muscle dysmorphia, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00193b6ntago5bjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One problem getting more information on the disorder is that people who have muscle dysmorphia likely have the gym and muscle building embedded in so much of their lives, that they are less likely to disrupt their world by seeking help, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001a3b6n7gbzregy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also difficult to determine the best treatment, because the condition resembles body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorder behaviors. Dietary practices and bulking and cutting, for example, can veer into disordered eating, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001b3b6nmicjqk1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; would likely be the first line of defense, he said. But, family-based treatment like those used for adolescents with eating disorders might provide benefit as well, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001c3b6nnr6d0mzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, with the potential for physical and mental health consequences, people concerned that they may be experiencing muscle dysmorphia should seek professional help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001d3b6n0hf0yxyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A therapist or health care provider may be a good place to start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001e3b6n5cya7av1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, the support comes from an interdisciplinary team including mental health, medical and nutrition providers, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001f3b6net42mr23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery from this condition isn’t linear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001g3b6n44agtvyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, Mycock can eat and exercise in a way that feels healthy and balanced, but body image is still something that takes some thought, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001h3b6nqm69mt7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are still times that he feels insecure, but his work with a counselor has helped him to not make his feelings about his body the foundation of his whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001i3b6np0cagj9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Previously, my life was built on a pillar, and the base of that pillar was the way that my body looked and the way people saw my body, and then everything else, like who I was, was built on top of that,” he said. “So, whenever something happened to that … my whole life fell apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001j3b6nkuuzrnpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His counselor has helped him change his perspective so that his body is one brick on the pyramid of his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001k3b6nrvazfs04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I now also have that I like that I’m funny and I’m a good friend and I’m a good partner,” Mycock said, “On those days when my body isn’t what I want it to be, or I feel insecure about it, it doesn’t matter, because I’ve got all these other things that I like about myself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNN</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 23:30:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBncnhrMFlsZDUycEhPU0RfNzc0WXVhM2FxbHplRnd1RXo4WE84YlZxTDlUX3hzb09CeXU5ZmpxTGsyMjJiTjUtOGZUU0VfWkpBRFd1bE9jNlBaRmhQWEcyNTZGQVF4WkZ5UzZ3SzExejR3WElNSVFLQjg2V3BxQQ</guid></item><item><title>令人惊叹的图表- Kottke.org</title><link>https://kottke.org/25/12/an-astonishing-graph</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post"&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;An Astonishing Graph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/child-mortality-graph.jpg" srcset="/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=500,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/child-mortality-graph.jpg 500w, /cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none/plus/misc/images/child-mortality-graph.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 500px, 1200px" loading="lazy" border="0" alt="a graph of child mortality that shows rates of 50% until around 1800 and then a steep drop to 4% in 2020"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of human history, around 50% of children used to die before they reached the end of puberty. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality"&gt;that number is 4.3%&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 0.3% in countries like Japan &amp;amp; Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dramatic decline has resulted from better nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, vaccinations, medicines, and reductions in poverty, conflicts, and famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before ~1800, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/parents-losing-their-child"&gt;almost every parent lost a child&lt;/a&gt;; now it’s such an uncommon experience that people have forgotten and want to ban vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;








&lt;p class="post-actions"&gt;

In a word—yikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But let’s rewind for just a sec.

(The study included 108 participants, both men and women, between the ages of 25 and 75.) What they found was that the molecules didn’t shift in numbers in a linear fashion over time, but in bursts around the ages of 44 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s,” &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; study senior author Michael Snyder, PhD, professor of genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine. “And that’s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Initially, researchers assumed that the mid-40s shift they noticed was due to the changes women in the test group were undergoing during &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause or menopause" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause or menopause&lt;/a&gt;. But when they isolated just the men, the same shift was still evident, leading them to theorize that there are other underlying drivers of aging for both men and women that have nothing to do with perimenopause or menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Further research will be needed to identify a lot of these whys—in addition to further validating the results. Given the study’s small participant pool and limited timespan (participants were followed for a median period of 1.7 years), a bigger, longer-term study will be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But the initial results were undeniably compelling.

And they don’t call it beauty rest for nothing. Says Marisa Garshick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist: “The nighttime is usually a reparative, restorative time for the skin.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Just how many hours a night should you be logging?

Cut back on alcohol.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="17" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One habit that could be disrupting your time in Dreamland? That nightly glass of Chardonnay. “As we age, we don't metabolize alcohol as easily, and it impairs our sleep quality,” says Keri Peterson, MD, an internal medicine physician, who begins discussing alcohol consumption more aggressively with patients in their 40s. “The metabolite of alcohol is a stimulant, so it wakes us up, often around 3 a.m.” (It’s worth noting that the Stanford study also found shifts in alcohol metabolism around ages 40 and 60.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If possible, Dr. Peterson recommends cutting alcohol out entirely. “Even with one glass, you're going to have disrupted sleep,” she says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="establish-a-strength-training-routine-if-you-havent-already" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;3. Establish a strength-training routine (if you haven’t already).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Women start losing muscle mass as early as their 30s. In fact, we lose about &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="3 to 5 percent per decade" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="22.1.0"&gt;3 to 5 percent per decade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But you can preserve the muscle mass you have—or even build more!—by lifting, even just a few days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It doesn't have to be five days a week like a bodybuilder in a gym,” says Kristen McParland, a NASM-certified personal trainer. “There's tons of research that shows just two days a week of full-body strength training can give you a laundry list of positive side effects to your immune system, your muscle mass, your bone density, your mood, your sleep, and your heart health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Of course, you can’t lift the same 3-lb. dumbbell week after week in the hopes of seeing gains. “In order to see change in a muscular bone joint, you need to challenge the muscle,” McParland says. You can do this by incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="progressive overload" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your routine, which essentially means upping the weight and/or reps every few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The Bottom line, says McParland: “If a client is in [the gym strength training] twice a week, they're lifting from 30 to 60 minutes full-body, and they're intentionally challenging their muscle groups—that's the most important part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-your-muscles-with-protein" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;4. Support your muscles with protein.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="28" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Show of hands: Who’s heard the saying “muscles are built in the kitchen“? While it’s a bit of a generalization, there’s certainly a nugget of truth to it, says McParland. “It doesn't matter how hard you work in the gym if you don't have an adequate protein and carbohydrate intake to help build the muscle.” While the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, McParland recommends aiming for .8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight to support muscle-building goals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-forget-the-cardio" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;5. Don’t forget the cardio.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="31" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The heart is a muscle, and it needs exercise too. (The Stanford study notes that aging has been associated with cardiovascular disease.) The &lt;a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="32.1.0"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But what exactly constitutes “moderate aerobic activity”? “I like to tell my clients that you should start to feel your heart rate go up, maybe you're a little out of breath, but you could still keep up with a brief conversation,” McParland says. That could take the form of incline walking, biking, hiking, or a light jog (emphasis on the light, McParland adds). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="protect-your-skin-with-spf" data-node-id="35" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;6. Protect your skin with SPF.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="36" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you aren’t already wearing a daily sunscreen on your face, neck, chest, and hands, now is the time to start, says Dr. Garshick. That’s because UV rays cause &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html#:~:text=UVA%20rays%20are%20mainly%20linked,to%20cause%20most%20skin%20cancers." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html#:~:text=UVA%20rays%20are%20mainly%20linked,to%20cause%20most%20skin%20cancers." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cells to age" data-node-id="37.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="37.1.0"&gt;skin cells to age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and can harm the cells’ DNA. (Plus, there’s the increased risk of skin cancer.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When shopping for a sunscreen, make sure it has an SPF of at least 30 (higher is even better) and that it’s marked as “broad spectrum,” meaning it provides coverage against both UVA and UVB rays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="39" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="as-you-approach-age-60" data-node-id="40" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;As You Approach Age 60...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you are already doing all of the above, here are a few more expert-backed action items to consider adding to your list in your later 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="talk-to-your-doc-about-hormone-replacements" data-node-id="42" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;1.

This causes numerous side effects, including hot flashes, weight gain, sleep disturbances and more. You may be able to stave off some of these symptoms—and prevent some age-related conditions—by taking a hormone replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“I do recommend women discuss the pros and cons, whether they're a candidate, and whether they think it's for them with their doctor,” says Dr. Peterson. “If you're doing estrogen and progesterone without testosterone, it's going to help hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis prevention, and just overall sense of wellbeing.

Predominantly, it seems to be a genetic condition, with studies showing that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4996332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;60–90%&lt;/a&gt; of the risk is heritable. Having a close relative with autism is a significant risk factor for developing ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many genes are involved in ASD risk. To date, more than &lt;a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/gene-scoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;900 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been implicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; play a part. These include being born to older parents, gestational diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy, and poor maternal mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have shown, however, that vaccines of any kind are not related to autism risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While animal research is a vital part of the scientific method, mouse models of ASD are fraught with challenges. Not least because many experts &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;believe that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; “ASD is a uniquely human disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When interpreting the results of any animal study, we need to be extra skeptical. This is particularly the case when investigating neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results of this study are encouraging, rodent models of ASD — although often created by altering genes that are known to be linked to ASD — are not a true representation of ASD in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/drmariaknobel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, MBBS, Medical Director at MedicalCert, who was not involved in the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Animal models provide a certain indication of the circuits and patterns of inflammation,” she explained, “but they cannot reflect human sensory or emotional life. A child who experiences sound at a greater intensity or an adult who has to plan his rest to prevent cognitive burnout traverses a sensory world that no rodent can know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings should be considered by the readers as early indicators that influence research and not as direct clinical instructions.”&lt;br&gt;— Maria Knöbel, MBBS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, experts believe that the traits associated with ASD are caused by problems that occur during development that impact brain cell signaling and the formation of synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the authors of the latest study focused on supplements that may support these functions, namely:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zinc: &lt;/strong&gt;A micronutrient that is important when forming synapses, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/137/1/137/360491?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;zinc deficiency&lt;/a&gt; has also been implicated in ASD-like behaviors in animal models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serine: &lt;/strong&gt;A common, non-essential amino acid, serine plays a role in metabolism and &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-00870-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;signaling between brain cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branch-chain amino acids (BCAA):&lt;/strong&gt; This group encompasses three essential amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Some of the genes associated with ASD control the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Cell" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(20)31146-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;transport or metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; of BCAA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists decided to combine them into one supplement for two reasons. Firstly, using three in combination meant that they could use low doses of each, which reduces the risk of the negative effects of high doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, while all three are thought to support brain function, they all do so in different ways, creating an opportunity for synergism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test and investigate, the researchers gave the supplement to three different mouse models of ASD. They then measured changes in protein expression in the animals’ brains and neural activity in part of the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brb3.2299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They chose the amygdala, specifically, because studies have shown that people with ASD have differences in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6546164/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt; or structure of their amygdalae, compared to neurotypical people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two of the mouse models, the scientists also analyzed any changes in the animals’ social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists used BCAA, serine, or zinc supplements individually, they found no changes in the brains or behavior of the rodents. However, when given as a trio, they identified improvements in protein synthesis in the brain, synapse activity, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors write: “Dietary supplements that enhance synaptic activity and protein synthesis can correct the abnormal neural activation and connectivity and improve the social behaviors of multiple ASD mouse models.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-first author, Ming-Hui Lin, was “thrilled to observe that just 7 days of treatment with the nutrient mixture significantly modulated neuronal circuit activity and connectivity in real time. These results provide strong support for the beneficial effects of low-dose nutrient supplement combinations.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As treatments for ASD are severely lacking, there may be a temptation to experiment on oneself or their child. However, this is not without risks. Speaking with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, Knöbel told us how she had seen people develop insomnia shortly after changing their supplement regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also told us how children, because of their smaller size, can easily be given “dangerous metabolic loads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agreement, clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.davincified.com/authors/eleni-nicolaou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eleni Nicolaou&lt;/a&gt; warned &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that supplements at the wrong dose “can cause significant changes in sleep, heart rate, and the effects of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have personally seen fatigue, nausea, and mood swings as a result of taking what appeared to be safe supplements,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, this study is a fascinating addition to our understanding of ASD. It may also be the first step along the road toward a simple treatment to ease symptoms for some people. However, much more work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 20:45:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNRXlGZ0h2RzBaMHhrNTc2bkxhZWFiRVp0SzV0cGNZU3N1SEpoSThzZVpxem51bFRUaW81cTFGbC13c2trWEFiakJjVVNuaTRXTUNTbGJWNDdOTkRNbzZCeGhtZF9XcUtCYUhfa1lPbVR0YnpVSk1vUnV3ZFQ1dThCYjdGUFFydDA1TkdwVWFlaUdTcGc4VmQtRUJfRHdIbFRwVEZCZnlR</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，橙汁会影响免疫细胞中的数千个基因- Euronews.com</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/12/02/orange-juice-found-to-affect-thousands-of-genes-in-immune-cells-study-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[6aW:mE÷aîjR€:Rşüù÷ßpıÿƒÑd¶Xmv‡Óåöx}~ÿ¯šU¹’è?®qõIô5*Î”ä·%µV¦{MÏ« ] ÀÀ*±ût6/²&amp;gt;ˆl´s/¿Í.�?j}ı¾Ó•dÇrMg+‰í¬gİÎ�ä

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Giving a young kid a smartphone may be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;New research conducted by scientists from UC Berkeley and Columbia University found that children 12 years old and younger who received one of these devices were at a higher risk of depression, obesity, and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The alarming findings, published as a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072941/205716/Smartphone-Ownership-Age-of-Smartphone-Acquisition?" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, were based on an analysis of over 10,000 children who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study between 2018 and 2020, which is purportedly the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the US. And while they don’t strictly establish causation, the broad correlation they show underscores a larger and ever-growing body of research exploring the deleterious cognitive effects that devices like smartphones and tablets can have adolescents, ranging from their &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;impact on their education&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-screen-time-developmental-delays"&gt;social skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“When you give your kid a phone, you need to think of it as something that is significant for the kid’s health — and behave accordingly,” lead author Ran Barzilay, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/well/family/early-smartphone-ownership-study.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In the study, about two-thirds of the participants used a smartphone. The median age they received them at was 11 years old, and their development was compared to a cohort of roughly 3,800 children in the study who never received a smartphone before turning 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Not only did the researchers find that children who owned a smartphone by age 12 were at a greater risk of depression, obesity, and poor sleep, but they also showed that the younger a child was when they first received a smartphone, the higher those risks became for obesity and poor sleep in particular. The earlier a kid is hooked on a smartphone, in other words, the worse their physical and mental health outcomes are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Trying to identify the “right” age to give a youth a smartphone, however, may be missing the point. The researchers also found that a group of children who had never owned a smartphone before turning 12, but were then given one, showed a higher risk of poorer mental health and sleep by the time they were 13, compared to another group who stayed phoneless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We didn’t even look at what the kids did on the phone,” Barzilay &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one’s own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That is both a strength and a drawback to the study. It’s likely that it’s not just a quality inherent to the smartphones that are causing problems, but the apps they give access to, like social media sites, whose myriad risks to children are well documented. YouTube, TikTok, and streaming services like Netflix could supply an endless amount of entertainment to keep a child well up past their bedtime, too. Then there’s addictive mobile games designed to both murder your attention span and drain your wallet. At this moment, we’re also plunging headlong into a world of AI chatbots and companions, which &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/lonely-children-ai-chatbots"&gt;many children are turning to act as a close friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A lot of questions are unanswered, but these latest findings are echoed by a bevy of other research. A &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/study-younger-kids-smartphones"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 100,000 children, for example, found that those who received smartphones before the age of 13 experienced more suicidal thoughts, a lower perception of self-worth, and detachment from reality. Similarly, the study also found that every year before 13 that a child received a smartphone was associated with a greater likelihood of poorer mental health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Society is still grappling with how these devices have transformed interpersonal relationships and taken over teenage and preteen attention spans. Many schools are opting to take the safe route by &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;banning smartphones entirely&lt;/a&gt;. In follow-up research, Barzilay hopes to explore more specific features of smartphone usage to determine their link to mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It’s critical for young people to have time away from their phones to engage in physical activity, which can protect against obesity and enhance mental health over time,” Barzilay said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-in-childhood-to-increased-risk-of-depression-and-obesity-in-youth-302627044.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the work.&lt;/p&gt;

They are anticipating to be open by the winter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spot, formerly the ELDR Restaurant, also has ties to Biltmore, the release said. It was the site of Biltmore Industries — originally founded in Biltmore Village with support from Edith Vanderbilt — and was purchased in 1917 by Fred Loring Seely, son-in-law of Edwin Grove and the visionary behind the Grove Park Inn, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Wayside owner Mark Harding said he and his wife are looking forward to starting business back up in the restaurant's new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/hurricane-helene-journey-hope-return-biltmore-village-recovery-over-11-months-nearly-one-year-post-storm-tourism-visitors-locals-business-owners-association" target="_blank"&gt;HELENE: A JOURNEY OF HOPE (RETURN TO BILTMORE VILLAGE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we will forever cherish the memories of our time in Biltmore Village in the iconic old train depot, we are excited to embrace this new chapter as a chance to rebuild, grow, and connect with the community,” he said in the release. “We can’t wait to welcome back our loyal patrons of many years and introduce the Wayside to the North Asheville community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hardings operated Village Wayside in Biltmore Village for 15 years at the historic spot next to the depot, which itself represents a pivotal chapter in Asheville’s development. According to the release, when George Vanderbilt visited the region in 1888, he envisioned both a grand estate and a surrounding village. To bring this vision to life, he hired architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Their combined efforts shaped not only the Biltmore Estate but also the community that became Biltmore Village. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The train depot opened in 1896 and remained a transportation hub until 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:02:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wJBVV95cUxNV0xTMmlyTy13VlNLZXc2RTZReTc5c2FHaDlBcnZqd0xRNXVldU9DQ0tOY3ZoRDltWF91T3I5cG9Dc0FrbVctcEE1NXY1ZVNEYjkxV2p3Qk0xZ0V5eTBoeHk5bEpJbnRITmNMMnhIckxOay04TTRYRDNkVmR6ZTh3YVBNTU54azJMWndVVnliZEVMMEk0aHUwc2pPNnczV1JSTzlGckRIYVlnVTBrNmVWa0t3NVJPVGdhNlZob041M2dnWi1hU2RTemxhdmhxTVBnYlBMa3cxZWJ1MlRKVG0tVmRLX1J4ZzQ0Tk1QVnpHdDM2VlMtNlFoaThtdWRnOWViOXlrdW9VUElpTHdnaEpPYWtqemFsaWE3bW5ZSDVqRlUySFZVcU9Cd3JLN0RDS3RjalpsRWROZ3pEa0hfX2VmWjVOVkRRdmQ1OW9TXzVkb081bm9aRkRN</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的疫苗顾问计划对儿童时间表进行最大的改变-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/02/acip-hepatitis-b-childhood-immunization-schedule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVZUM7HBPRCRXOG4SRIOIIZFGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Federal vaccine advisers selected by Health Secretary Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;CDC data has found that boys and young men, aged 12 to 24, have a heightened risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) after COVID-19 vaccination. However, the cases are rare, relatively mild, and almost always resolve, according to CDC data. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/04-Meyer-COVID-508.pdf"&gt;In a COVID-19 safety data presentation in June&lt;/a&gt;, CDC staff scientists reported that its vast vaccine safety monitoring systems indicated that in males 12–24, there are 27 myocarditis cases per million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered (roughly one case in 37,000 doses). In cases identified during 2021, 83 percent recovered within three months, with more than 90 percent recovering within the year. The monitoring data found no instances of cardiac transplant or death from COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine activists have seized on this minor risk from vaccination, health experts note that the risk of myocarditis and other inflammatory conditions from a COVID-19 infection is significantly greater than the risk from vaccination. Exact estimates vary, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm"&gt;one CDC study in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that people with COVID-19 infections had a 16-fold higher risk of myocarditis than people without the infection. Specifically, the study estimated that there were 150 myocarditis cases among 100,000 COVID-19-infected patients versus just nine myocarditis cases among 100,000 people without COVID-19 infections and who were also unvaccinated. Similar to what’s seen with vaccination, the study found that young males were most at risk of myocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s allies attack on COVID-19 shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his allies, like Milhoan, have consistently inflated the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccination, with some claiming without evidence that they have caused sudden cardiac arrest and deaths in young males, though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;studies have found no such link&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, Milhoan and fellow ACIP member and conspiracy theorist Robert Malone were featured in &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/SEVCD"&gt;a viral social media post&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that 50 percent of college athletes in the Big Ten athletic conference had myocarditis linked to COVID-19 vaccines, which could lead to deaths if they played. But the two were referencing a JAMA Cardiology study that examined subclinical myocarditis in Big Ten athletes &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548"&gt;after COVID-19 &lt;em&gt;infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—not vaccination. In fact, researchers confirmed for &lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32HC88U"&gt;an AFP fact check&lt;/a&gt; that none of the athletes in the study were vaccinated. And the rate of subclinical myocarditis in the group was 2.3 percent, not 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmioufc0r002b3b794rqe8vtx@published"&gt;I am a 47-year-old man married to a 42-year-old woman. My wife and I have a decent sex life. But as in most marriages with children, my sex drive is quite higher than hers. I’d probably be good for two to three times a week where whereas she is good for about two to three times a month.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="16" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmioufc0r002c3b79pztkg2wr@published"&gt;One of the things I like to do most is to go down on my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

Even during the act (usually I spend anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes down there), I often have a reaction where I build up sinus pressure and can get a runny nose. It’s difficult to diagnose sinus infections, and the symptoms usually pass after two to three days, but this last one lasted over a week. Have you ever heard of anything like getting a head cold/flu/sinus infection from cunnilingus?&lt;/p&gt;

To figure out what’s going on with you, specifically, you’re going to need the help of a doctor. And you’ll be best off at that doctor appointment if you have some more data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmioufc0s002g3b79uuavvyoe@published"&gt;Keep track of three things for a few months—when your sinuses are stuffy, runny, or otherwise affected, when you give your wife oral sex, and when the kids are sick. However, you want to track this (a list, a calendar app, or a paper planner) is fine, but you need to be meticulous, and you should log everything to the exact day and keep logging throughout the entire duration. Do this daily. Your memory, like everyone’s, is fallible, and if you’re trying to remember a week’s worth of stuff, you’re going to make mistakes. You might also see whether your wife is open to trying a dental dam, mostly to figure out whether that prevents the sinus symptoms, but there’s also a chance that she really enjoys the sensation and it works for her in a way that raw oral doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

We lost our personal connection and I felt lost, lonely, and in need of the human connection and sexual gratification that I no longer had with my husband. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/09/wife-cheating-spouse-divorce-advice.html"&gt;So, I had an affair that happened organically with a man who was also in a miserable marriage…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent source of amino acids&lt;/a&gt;, the building blocks of protein. One large hard-boiled egg provides 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not just about the amount of protein. Eggs boast one of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7821729/myths-about-protein-fact-or-fiction/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;highest-quality forms of protein&lt;/a&gt;, which is readily available to your body to use for things like muscle-building and repair.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because eggs’ protein also promotes satiety, they may help with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056824/16-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks-that-actually-work-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;. If weight loss is a goal, a hard-boiled egg can be a good snack, especially when paired with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://kimberlygomer.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kimberly Gomer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While egg whites are mostly protein, the yolks are the true nutritional gold mines. In addition to protein, the yolks contain nutrients many of us don’t get enough of, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamins D and E&lt;/a&gt;. Egg yolks are also one of the best sources of choline, which supports brain and nerve function, says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/mia-syn?utm_source=google" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mia Syn, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just one large egg provides 27% of the Daily Value for this underconsumed nutrient. Eggs also give you vitamin A, iodine and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although cottage cheese contains a different set of vitamins and minerals than eggs, it still offers an impressive menu of micronutrients. “In addition to protein, it also provides key nutrients, including calcium and phosphorus, which are important for bone health, as well as B vitamins, which help convert the food we eat into energy,” says Syn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;live bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that promote the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;health of your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some types of cottage cheese contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;added probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nope. “Both are nutritious snack options on their own, but to make them more balanced, you can pair them with other foods,” says Syn. For example, a hard-boiled egg has protein and fat, so add a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-to-eat-every-week-11787950" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like whole-grain toast or a piece of fruit, she recommends. For cottage cheese, top it with fruit like fresh berries. For an additional &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993588/ways-to-add-healthy-fat-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;source of healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, add some nuts or seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding both to your weekly rotation is a great way to rack up a variety of nutrients. Plus, they’re super-convenient. Grocery and convenience stores may sell small cups of cottage cheese or packages of hard-boiled eggs. So, each can be a nice grab-and-go protein source when you’re out and about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one caveat: Your individual health concerns. If you are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to dairy&lt;/a&gt;, you may experience &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-reasons-youre-so-gassy-11755428" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bloating or gas&lt;/a&gt; after eating dairy foods like cottage cheese, says Gomer. That’s because cottage cheese contains lactose, which some people are unable to digest fully. (However, it contains less lactose than milk.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese is also typically &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290568/looking-for-low-sodium-foods-watch-out-for-these-sneaky-sources-of-sodium/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in sodium&lt;/a&gt;, with about 360 milligrams per half-cup. That can be an issue for you if you have high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, there are no-added-sodium versions you can buy with as little as 15 mg of sodium per half-cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What about the cholesterol in eggs? It’s not a reason to avoid them. But if you have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893923/habits-to-break-to-lower-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; or are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, your health care provider may recommend limiting egg intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024093/best-low-fat-cheeses/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;saturated fat in full-fat cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; can also raise blood cholesterol levels. So, if you’re on team cottage cheese and have high cholesterol, stick with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283529/is-cottage-cheese-or-greek-yogurt-a-healthier-high-protein-snack/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both hard-boiled eggs and cottage cheese are nutritious snacks that are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snacks-more-protein-than-egg-11744826" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packed with protein, vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;. To make each of these foods even more nutritious, our registered dietitians recommend pairing them with fruits or vegetables for fiber and extra vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. If you have specific health concerns, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-cholesterol-cardiologist-recommendations-11780658" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure or high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, your health care provider may recommend avoiding or limiting your intake of either full-fat cottage cheese or hard-boiled eggs. Otherwise, pick the one you like best—or, better yet, both of them!&lt;br&gt;

He said: “Omega-3 fatty acids aren’t a wellness fad; they are essential nutrients linked to heart health, brain development, inflammation control and healthy ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Adults are recommended to consume 250 mg per day of combined EPA and DHA, with an additional 100–200 mg of DHA advised for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;However, Dr. Abbie Cawood, who was involved in the &lt;a href="/topic/study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; and is the science director at Holland &amp;amp; Barrett and a visiting research fellow at the University of Southampton, said in a statement: “Achieving recommended intakes from diet alone can be challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;What Is Omega-3?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The British Heart Foundation, a UK-based charity that funds cardiovascular research, explains that the body needs omega-3s to function but can’t make them itself, so they must come from food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The omega-3s most important for health are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="List_wp-block-list__nTkVj"&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA):&lt;/strong&gt; found in certain nuts and seeds and oils made from them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: found in mainly in oily fish but also white fish and seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)&lt;/strong&gt;:  mainly in oily fish but also white fish and seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;ALA is the only omega-3 that’s truly essential because our bodies can not produce it. We can convert a small amount of ALA into EPA and DHA, but not enough to rely on— so it is still useful to eat foods that provide EPA and DHA directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;Why Omega-3 Matters Across the Lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/daily-omega-3-fish-oil-change-behavior-scientists-supplements-1906195"&gt;Omega-3 consumption supports a healthy lifestyle &lt;/a&gt;at every stage of life—from lowering the chance of pre-term birth and aiding visual and cognitive development in infants, to improving cardiovascular health and immune function later on. It is also associated with a reduced risk of depression and cognitive decline, including &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alzheimers-dementia-omega-3-fatty-acids-women-2115662"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Banerjee, the founder of private healthcare service HarleyDoc, said meeting the guidelines is easier said than done for many due to several factors, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="List_wp-block-list__nTkVj"&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cost-of-living pressures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reduced fish availability in certain regions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cultural dietary patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;He added: “There’s widespread misunderstanding of what constitutes ‘enough’ omega-3. These factors all play a role. Even in countries with abundant seafood, many individuals simply don’t consume oily fish regularly enough to reach recommended intakes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;How to Increase Omega-3 Intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Banerjee explained that the most effective approach for those who eat fish involves eating oily varieties once or twice per week. The richest sources are mackerel, salmon, sardines, herring and anchovies—cold-water species naturally high in EPA and DHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;But not everyone likes fish, can afford it or follows a meat-based diet; therefore, supplementation is often the only viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Banerjee said: “A good supplement should provide at least 500 mg of combined EPA/DHA per day, be tested for purity and oxidation, and ideally come in triglyceride form for better absorption. For vegetarians and vegans, algae-derived omega-3s offer an effective alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that Newsweek should be covering?

New research shows that simple fertilizers from these peels can make plants taller and healthier than those in untreated soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are one of the world’s top fruit crops, with harvests reaching about 116 million tons in recent years. Because the peel makes up a quarter of each fruit by weight, mountains of skins end up as waste instead of feeding soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-banana-peels-crops-and-soil"&gt;Banana peels, crops, and soil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work behind the new review was led by Nokuthula Khanyile, a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.ump.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Mpumalanga&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research focuses on turning agricultural waste, including banana peels, into safer fertilizers that support both crops and soil life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/11/1894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, her team gathered results from 126 studies that tested banana peel based fertilizers on many different crops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across those experiments, plants given peel based treatments often grew taller, produced more leaves, or germinated faster than plants grown in untreated soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banana peels are packed with macronutrients, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plants-have-genetic-tricks-to-survive-wild-nutrient-swings/"&gt;nutrients plants&lt;/a&gt; need in relatively large amounts. Analyses of their chemistry show high potassium alongside nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium, which are exactly the elements farmers buy in commercial fertilizer blends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now most banana peels still go to landfills, where rotting food adds to greenhouse gas emissions and wastes all of those nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning them into fertilizers instead links a common household habit, eating bananas, with cleaner farming and less pressure to mine or manufacture new nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-kitchen-scrap-to-biofertilizer"&gt;From kitchen scrap to biofertilizer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers use the word biofertilizer, fertilizer made from living or once living materials, for many of these peel based products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some methods are simple, such as sun drying peels, grinding them into a coarse powder, and mixing that directly into the soil before planting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That review found one recipe turning up often, a blend of dried banana peels with dried orange peels used as fertilizer. In the trials it summarized, this fruit peel mix often increased leaf area and root length more than untreated soils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other teams crushed fresh peels into slurry and heated them with simple ingredients, then filtered the liquid to make concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-green-tech-ammonia-fertilizer-production-using-earths-natural-forces/"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That liquid can be diluted with water and poured onto soil, so plants take up the nutrients through their roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some projects go further and ferment banana peels with coffee grounds or other plant wastes. During that time, microbes slowly release nutrients into the liquid, and early tests suggest the resulting fertilizers can speed up leafy vegetable growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-banana-peels-on-crops"&gt;Testing banana peels on crops&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One experiment with pea plants tested banana peels decomposed in soil for different lengths of time. Peels that had broken down for about two months supported the best germination and growth, while longer decomposition made the plants weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also tested peels that had decomposed in water instead of soil. Those peels gave the highest germination rate after about six months, but plant height stopped improving as decomposition went on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/seeds-rich-in-protein-and-magnesium-help-grow-muscle-mass-fenugreek/"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt;, researchers compared dried &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/banana-apocalypse-can-science-save-our-favorite-fruit/"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; peel powders with liquid extracts made from the same material. Plants given the liquid extract grew taller and produced more greens over the same period than those given the dry powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In okra experiments, researchers combined banana peel powders with other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/banana-apocalypse-can-science-save-our-favorite-fruit/"&gt;fruit peels&lt;/a&gt; and added them before planting and again later near the stems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That schedule produced richer leaf color, larger leaf area, and heavier pods than soil that only received the usual chemical fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-fertilizers"&gt;Implications for fertilizers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern farming still leans heavily on synthetic NPK fertilizers, which are blends of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium made in factories that depend on fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products have boosted yields for decades, but overuse lets extra nitrogen wash into water and trigger eutrophication, overgrowth of algae that harms fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One global &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18773-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that synthetic nitrogen fertilizers produce about 2 percent of total human greenhouse gas emissions. That share is large for a single farm input, so any safe replacement for part of this nitrogen matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/understanding-impacts-synthetic-nitrogen-air-and-water-quality-using-integrated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) has linked excess fertilizer nitrogen to smog, fine-particle pollution, and unhealthy levels of nitrate in drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because banana peel based fertilizers release nutrients slowly and rely on recycled waste, they offer a route to cut losses while keeping yields steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crop-lessons-from-banana-peels"&gt;Crop lessons from banana peels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For home gardeners and small farms, the message is straightforward. Banana peels, orange peels, coffee grounds, and similar scraps can be turned into useful fertilizer with simple tools instead of being tossed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also highlights what does not work as well. Banana peel biochar, a charcoal like soil additive made from heated plant waste, often had little effect on plant height at the doses tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the trials reviewed stopped at the seedling or early growth stage. Researchers still need long season field tests that follow crops to harvest and check not just yield, but also nutrient content and shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of banana peels changes with variety, climate, and storage, so future work needs recipes that farmers can trust from season to season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes measuring not only nutrient levels in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-waste-could-be-used-as-sustainable-fertilizer/"&gt;fertilizers&lt;/a&gt;, but also how each blend affects soil structure and root microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If even a fraction of the world’s banana peels were turned into well tested fertilizers, farmers could cut their dependence on costly synthetic products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work on kitchen waste based fertilizers suggests that a cleaner fertilizer future may already be sitting in compost buckets on kitchen counters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/11/1894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:21:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNVkUyQmRXVDRLUVdzTnItNzJUdUZPQ2Ezb0ducWNISlBubjU0Q050ME9aS3ppY0N6SnQwX1g3aDBNVG5sYWJKOXRzRVhKWFR0TDI4Yk1BbHJjeFpNTEVCeGI4UGZpVXNsNHBhdkM0ajBVcFprNHp6ZUgxaE53T1J4TlBIQnpOUnRRNnprVFpuajZGS0V5aVhVemdFNFIxUDM2WTlTdTBUUmxVbEdB</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，带状疱疹疫苗可能会减缓痴呆症的进展- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-progression-study-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioo1bkc001w2cnngi25cluh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;shingles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; not only offers protection against the painful viral infection, but a new study suggests that the two-dose shot also may slow the progression of dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000a3b6nc6g0yzj9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shingles, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, presents as a painful rash and it’s estimated that about 1 in every 3 people in the United States will develop the illness in their lifetime. But the risk of shingles and serious complications increases with age, which is why in the United States, two doses of the shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 50 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000b3b6nymgnmm26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While vaccination is estimated to be more than 90% effective at preventing shingles in older adults, recent research has shed light on some other potential benefits too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000c3b6nzalbj2t5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Emerging research suggests that getting the vaccine to protect against shingles may &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/health/shingles-vaccines-dementia-studies"&gt;reduce the risk of developing dementia&lt;/a&gt;. A follow-up study, published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.007" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, adds to that research by suggesting that the vaccine could also have therapeutic properties against dementia, by slowing the progression of the disease, leading to a reduced risk of dying from the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000d3b6n7cfarsjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We see an effect on your probability of dying from dementia among those who already have dementia,” Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, assistant professor of medicine at &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; and senior author of the new study, said about the potential effects of the shingles vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000e3b6nrmpundx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means that the vaccine doesn’t just have a preventive potential, but actually a therapeutic potential as a treatment, because we see some benefits already among those who have dementia,” he said. “To me, this was really exciting to see and unexpected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000g3b6nngfrr3dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study comes just months after Geldsetzer and his colleagues previously found evidence that shingles vaccination may offer a “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;dementia-preventing&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;dementia-delaying&lt;/a&gt;” effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000h3b6nx972rp0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that previous study, the researchers analyzed the health records of older adults in Wales, where a &lt;a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/immunisation-and-vaccines/vaccines-professionals/shingles-information-for-health-professionals/" target="_blank"&gt;shingles vaccination program&lt;/a&gt; for adults in their 70s was introduced on September 1, 2013. The program indicated that anyone who was 79 on that date was eligible for the vaccine for one year, but those who were 80 or older were not eligible for the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000i3b6nqe9c7u5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those eligibility requirements allowed the researchers to examine data on the adults who were 79 and got vaccinated and then compare that data with the adults who were 80 and not eligible for vaccination but may have gotten the vaccine if they could.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000j3b6nn0nhzn61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are comparing groups of patients whose only difference is a tiny difference in age, just like a week or so, and they have this massive difference in the probability of ever getting vaccinated because of these unique eligibility rules,” Geldsetzer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000k3b6ntvo6zi6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among those adults in Wales, the researchers found that receiving the shingles vaccine reduced the probability of being newly diagnosed with dementia by 3.5 percentage points over a seven-year period, compared with not receiving the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000l3b6nojrvxxd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know they should have similar physical activity level, diets, et cetera,” Geldsetzer said. “So, we’re much more confident that what we’re actually looking at here is cause and effect, rather than just correlation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000n3b6n92jh3b1x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, in the new follow-up study, the same researchers analyzed the same data set of the adults in Wales, which included more than 282,500 adults. But this time, the researchers examined differences in the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment diagnoses and, among people already living with dementia, differences in the incidence of deaths due to dementia, while comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000o3b6neu0injcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key strength of our natural experiments is that these comparison groups should be similar in all characteristics except for a minute difference in age,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000p3b6nmoy7c0us@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To strengthen their findings, the researchers also analyzed similar health records in Australia, which has a similar shingles vaccination program as Wales.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000q3b6nes9cs94f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that among older adults without any record of cognitive impairment prior to getting vaccinated, among those who received the shingles vaccine saw a reduction of 3.1 percentage points in their risk of being newly diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment over a nine-year period compared with those who did not receive the vaccine. And the protective effects appeared to be stronger among women than men, which was also found in the previous study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000r3b6n5lm5u4xi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, among older adults already living with dementia, the researchers found that those who received the shingles vaccine saw a drop of 29.5 percentage points in their risk of dying due to the disease over a nine-year period compared with those who did not get vaccinated – suggesting that the vaccine may play a role in slowing the progression of dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000s3b6neo4f6v1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It seems to have these strong benefits across the entire disease course,” Geldsetzer said about the shingles vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000u3b6n1in6tgnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study turned a spotlight on the possible relationship between shingles vaccination and dementia outcomes, it did not specifically uncover why the vaccine may have these potential effects. But Geldsetzer had some theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000v3b6nwisghwed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Broadly speaking, you can think about two mechanisms,” Geldsetzer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000w3b6n1z1cilra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, the &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/patients-and-visitors/advances-consumers/issues/understanding-the-connection-between-chickenpox-and-shingles" target="_blank"&gt;same virus that causes shingles&lt;/a&gt; also causes chickenpox. After someone has chickenpox in childhood, the virus remains dormant in the nervous system and people get shingles when the virus reactivates in their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000x3b6nsk7d8rwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even while the virus is hibernating in the nervous system, “this causes a constant interplay with the immune system,” Geldsetzer said. “We know this causes inflammation in the nervous system, and we know inflammation is a key process in so many chronic diseases, including dementia. So, it makes sense that reducing these reactivations through shingles vaccination may have benefits for the dementia disease process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000y3b6nvb7q4i38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second possible mechanism, Geldsetzer said, is that the vaccine can provide a big boost to the immune system overall, strengthening it as a whole to fight off infections. And there is a growing body of research linking various &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/possible-risks-of-dementia/infections#?c" target="_blank"&gt;infections to increased dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, so being better fit to fight off any infection could help with lowering dementia risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000z3b6nt5n2c6wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s increasing evidence that vaccines have broader effects on the immune system, beyond just the specific antibody response that it has been designed to elicit,” Geldsetzer said. “These kinds of broader immune system activations may well have benefits for dementia disease development as well, and we know the immune system plays a key role in dementia. So that’s the other mechanism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr00103b6nfsuqocgl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Geldsetzer said that, as a next step, he and his colleagues plan to raise funding to “conclusively test” this link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risks in a randomized clinical trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioo1d1400003b6np2m6c2sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the new study shows that the shingles vaccine protects cognition from early to late stages of dementia, Dr. Angelina Sutin, professor of behavioral sciences and social medicine at Florida State University College of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000163b6nvpbaxiwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When people find out that I study dementia, they often ask what I recommend to keep the brain healthy with age. I always respond with three things: exercise, be social, and do things you enjoy that make you feel purposeful. Now, I will add talk to your doctor about getting the shingles vaccine. There is no guarantee that doing these things means you will not get dementia, but all are relatively easy and accessible and help maintain healthy cognition for longer,” Sutin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000173b6ns9ed48zq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she added that what exactly may be driving this relationship between the shingles vaccine and reduced dementia risks remains a mystery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000183b6ntr5ivrqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is still unknown. This study is a very important advance in understanding because it provides the closest to causal evidence for the shingles vaccine that is possible. Unfortunately, it does not directly answer the why,” she said. “This research sets a strong foundation for future research to find out why it is so protective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmios0rbb00063b6nlce3f280@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU Langone, notes an important caveat about the study: the findings may not generalize to a newer vaccine that is now widely used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmios1vjz00093b6npsojctqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would view these results as promising, providing unique evidence that shingles vaccination may have meaningful cognitive benefits, but not yet as definitive proof that we should vaccinate solely for dementia risk reduction,” Salinas said. “It’s reasonable to frame the connection as biologically plausible and increasingly well-supported by high-quality epidemiologic data, but still in need of mechanistic studies and replication before we can say definitively why shingles vaccination appears to be associated with lower dementia risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNN</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:16:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQNG5IaEFQajhWVTlBWURQMkdJNW1oSDJKT1JyMVE4Q21jS1FVaGRzWEJyOXdweVJPWDdtRkxySWFUUERHWUtVanhtaGJtSDVuMkN1ZF9veWRzOUpQZnRqa0VLVnB1LTNIMDYxaVdrWjJUMVBnM0tZRFJWcllPMXBfb2NWZkJfZThfY0NyQmtIZDJDRko3</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现首个被证明可直接导致精神疾病的基因- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251202052230.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly one in seven people across the globe lived with a mental illness in 2021, with anxiety disorders and depression occurring most frequently. These conditions often stem from a mix of influences, and genetics play a major part in shaping a person's risk. Having a close family member with a mental illness remains one of the strongest known predictors. Until recently, research suggested that psychiatric disorders typically develop from the combined effects of many different genes.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our current findings indicate that GRIN2A is the first known gene that, on its own, can cause a mental illness. This distinguishes it from the polygenic causes of such disorders that have been assumed to date," says Professor Johannes Lemke, lead author of the study and Director of the Institute of Human Genetics at the University of Leipzig Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Links GRIN2A Variants to Early-Onset Psychiatric Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this investigation, researchers conducted a statistical analysis of data from 121 individuals who carried a genetic change in the GRIN2A gene. "We were able to show that certain variants of this gene are associated not only with schizophrenia but also with other mental illnesses. What is striking is that, in the context of a GRIN2A alteration, these disorders already appear in childhood or adolescence -- in contrast to the more typical manifestation in adulthood," says Professor Lemke. The research team also highlighted an unexpected finding: some participants showed only psychiatric symptoms, even though GRIN2A changes are usually linked to epilepsy or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How GRIN2A Affects Brain Signaling and a Possible Treatment Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GRIN2A gene helps regulate how active nerve cells are by influencing their electrical signaling. In this study, certain gene variants reduced the function of the NMDA receptor, a key component involved in communication between brain cells. Working with Dr. Steffen Syrbe, Professor at the Heidelberg Medical Faculty and pediatric neurologist at Heidelberg University Hospital, the team demonstrated that this reduced activity may be medically important. In an early treatment effort, patients experienced noticeable improvements in psychiatric symptoms after receiving L-serine -- a dietary supplement that activates the NMDA receptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors Johannes Lemke and Steffen Syrbe have collaborated for nearly 15 years in both clinical and research settings to better understand disorders involving the brain's glutamate receptor in children with neurological conditions. Over this period, Professor Lemke established an international registry containing the largest known group of GRIN2A patients worldwide, providing the foundation for the findings published in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;New research shows that terminally ill baby ants tell other ants to kill them, potentially protecting the rest of the colony from their infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66175-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Nature Communications, researchers revealed that ant pupae—what a larva grows into before becoming an adult—of the &lt;em&gt;Lasius neglectus&lt;/em&gt; ant species actively produce a chemical signal that causes other colony members to destroy them. The findings further solidify the view of an ant colony as a “superorganism” behaving as a single entity rather than a community of many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Selfless ants&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sick individuals often conceal their disease status to group members, thereby preventing social exclusion or aggression,” the researchers wrote in the paper. On the other hand, researchers have documented sick adult ants leaving their colony to avoid spreading their disease. Pupae, however, are encased in a cocoon and cannot leave, so they resort to a rather extreme strategy&lt;span&gt;—emitting a chemical signal essentially calling for self-destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Adult ants that approach death leave the nest to die outside the colony. Similarly, workers that have been exposed to fungal spores practice social distancing,” Sylvia Cremer, co-author of the study and group leader of the Cremer Group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), said in an ISTA statement. “Yet, this is only possible for mobile individuals. Ant brood within the colony, like infected cells in tissue, are largely immobile and lack this option.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once worker ants receive the signal, they take the pupae from the cocoon, punch holes into them, and inject them with formic acid—an antimicrobial poison that works like a self-produced disinfectant. This kills the pathogens but also the pupae.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research had demonstrated that worker ants can recognize sick pupae and kill them to disinfect the nest, scientists didn’t know if passive cues or intentional signaling by the sick pupae triggered this dynamic. To shed light on the matter, the scientists behind the new study infected &lt;em&gt;Lasius neglectus&lt;/em&gt; ants with a fungal pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;BO as a warning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the experiment, sick worker pupae emitted a modified body smell (the chemical signal) that warned the adult ants to destroy them. Only sick ants near adult worker ants produced this signal, indicating that the cue isn’t just an immune response or side effect of infection. When the researchers applied the smell to healthy pupae, they were also destroyed, confirming the chemical’s role in triggering the response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because workers destroy specific pupae within an entire &lt;a href="https://www.ant-shack.com/blogs/ant-articles/the-importance-of-ant-brood-care-nurturing-the-next-generation?srsltid=AfmBOoo4t6Bay3EDJJ1SxrfgpZqKO7xebay3dzSlKkr_Ad2-yM-UqotB"&gt;brood&lt;/a&gt; (eggs, larvae, and pupae) pile, “the scent cannot simply diffuse through the nest chamber but must be directly associated with the diseased pupa,” explained Thomas Schmitt, co-author of the study and a chemical ecologist from the University of Würzburg. “Accordingly, the signal does not consist of volatile compounds but instead is made up of non-volatile compounds on the pupal body surface.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While colonies are technically communities made of many individual ants, they work as a single superorganism. Ants within a colony are like the cells in our body. For example, ant queens are responsible for producing offspring, and non-fertile workers are responsible for the colony’s maintenance and health. Similarly, our germline cells are responsible for the production of offspring, and our somatic cells execute all the other important tasks. Along those same lines, the signaling from terminally ill pupae mirrors the way our body’s cells release chemical cues—called the “find-me and eat-me signal”—for our immune cells, which then identify and destroy the signaling cells to eliminate the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Queen ants don’t need to be destroyed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For ants, “what appears to be self-sacrifice at first glance is, in fact, also beneficial to the signaler: it safeguards its nestmates, with whom it shares many genes. By warning the colony of their deadly infection, terminally ill ants help the colony remain healthy and produce daughter colonies, which indirectly pass on the signaler’s genes to the next generation,” explained Erika Dawson, first author of the study and a behavioral ecologist at ISTA. If a terminally ill ant pretended to be healthy and died, it could become infectious and endanger the whole colony.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers did not observe queen pupae emit the chemical signal. They have stronger immune defenses than worker pupae and can restrict the infection independently. Worker pupae, however, couldn’t control the infection and warned the colony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sick pupae only emit the signal when the infection is uncontrollable, empowering fellow ants to intervene in situations of real threats while avoiding the destruction of pupae that can recover. “This precise coordination between the individual and colony level is what makes this altruistic disease signaling so effective,” Cremer concluded.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxOeHQwb2U0WVd3Vkt3UlBKc2lGVlA0OHBXaTJNMm5jc2tEMGtGZWdMaEd6ZlhMOEhJQmhnZUdTZm5tUHVOazNKRlF4ZzlULXYwZTVmRFdMOXhPMm9waTZONl95MEp2bzl0NDJpUmNfUjNQcU1fOVdEbjdwXzlVbnc5QUM2RWFZQzhEMHp0LTR4cHplc3VDd1cteVVrSlBvS0JOcUF5SUVjUWhFY3NaQ3RjbUFydzJMazJpVnJFYmIwQUdpcnpHOEdaeHhkSVhKaVlLeExWSmpfLS01RzQ</guid></item><item><title>痴呆症疫苗可能是真实的，我们中的一些人在不知情的情况下接种了它- BBC科学焦点杂志</title><link>https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/shingles-vaccine-dementia</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div _ngcontent-pxp-c1839238051 class="purple-inner-container purple-content-body-inner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shingles vaccine could reduce your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; by 20 per cent or slow the progression of the disease once you’ve got it, according to recent research led by Stanford University, in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these findings can be backed up in future research, the vaccine – which is already available – could be used to help prevent and treat dementia: an incurable disease that affects an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;estimated 57 million people&lt;/a&gt; globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists analysed the health records of more than 280,000 adults in Wales between the ages of 71 and 88 years old. They were aiming to understand the effects of a shingles vaccination programme that began in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that older adults (aged 79–80) who had received the shingles vaccine were 20 per cent less likely to develop dementia by 2020, compared to those who hadn’t been eligible to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Pascal Geldsetzer&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, said this was “a really striking finding,” adding: “This huge protective signal was there, any which way you looked at the data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, in a &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recent follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, the same scientists discovered that the shingles vaccine seemed to have a protective effect even among those who’d already been diagnosed with dementia by 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 7,049 Welsh adults included in the study who had dementia, nearly half had died within the following nine years. But among those who had received the shingles vaccine, only 30 per cent had died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most exciting part is that this really suggests that the shingles vaccine doesn’t have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia,” said Geldsetzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/12/Vaccine-1.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="An illustration of the Varicella zoster virus" class="wp-image-209937"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An illustration of the Varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles - Credit: Getty images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already pointed to a potential link between the shingles vaccine and dementia protection, but all of them were weakened by the fact that those who get vaccinated tend to also lead healthier lives in general (so their protection from dementia may have come from elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this study, that bias wasn’t such a problem. That’s because the vaccination programme was only eligible to a specific group of people: those who were 79 years old on 1 September 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that if you take a thousand people at random born in one week, and a thousand people at random born a week later, there shouldn’t be anything different about them on average,” said Geldsetzer. “They are similar to each other apart from this tiny difference in age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: the scientists could directly compare two groups, with the same average mixture of more health-conscious and less health-conscious people, born only a week apart. The only difference between them was their eligibility for this vaccine – making its efficacy against dementia much easier to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shingles is an infection caused by the &lt;em&gt;Varicella zoster&lt;/em&gt; virus – the bug to blame for chickenpox. Its symptoms include a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/what-is-pain"&gt;painful&lt;/a&gt; rash, burning or tingling feelings, headaches, fever and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus affects the nervous system, but scientists aren’t yet sure exactly how a shingles vaccine might protect the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/human-brain"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; from cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prediabetes affects about 96 million Americans, but only 20% know they have the condition. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Redditor shared how they reversed prediabetes, including eating more veggies and fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting enough sleep and losing weight can also help reverse a prediabetes diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prediabetes is a common condition where your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-too-high-11679557" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar runs high&lt;/a&gt;, but not quite high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. What’s more, only 20% of the nearly 96 million American adults who have prediabetes actually know that they have it. That’s because prediabetes is “silent” since there aren’t any signs or symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Despite those staggering statistics, there is a silver lining. Taking action steps to make healthful diet and lifestyle changes can reverse prediabetes—&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291826/7-simple-ways-to-reverse-prediabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cutting your diabetes risk in half&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

He shared on Reddit that seeing his blood sugar in the prediabetes range energized him to make some healthy changes. In his Reddit post, he shared the five steps he took to successfully &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001265/can-you-reverse-diabetes-what-experts-say/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower his A1c&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to find out what steps Taylor took and what dietitians have to say about his approach.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290924/diabetes-information-know-the-basics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diabetes can run in families&lt;/a&gt;, which is why it was already on Taylor’s radar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So seeing his own blood sugars in the prediabetes range, he knew it was time to make some changes. “I also just generally started to take my fitness and nutrition more seriously,” he says. When deciding where to start, he turned to the internet (like the rest of us!) to find answers to what he should be eating to reverse his prediabetes. After some experimentation, these were the five habits that brought down Taylor’s blood sugars: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mixing brown rice with white rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more vegetables at dinner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating fruits as snacks (but I still have the occasional brownie or bag of chips).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following a regular weight-lifting program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Part of the reason that these action steps were so effective is that they were habits that Taylor found easy to incorporate into his day-to-day life. Fun was also a key piece of the puzzle for making movement more enjoyable (and sustainable). “Using an Apple Watch and playing a game like Pokémon Go or Pikmin Bloom motivated me to get my steps in,” says Taylor. You also don’t need to be in the gym every day to see results. Taylor found a workout routine that fit his schedule, settling on two to three full-body gym sessions per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-dietitians-weigh-in-on-this-approach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Dietitians Weigh In on This Approach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Realistic and Sustainable Habits  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sustainability is the name of the game when you are trying to stop prediabetes in its tracks. That’s one of the reasons why dietitians liked Taylor’s approach. “I really like that these tips focus on realistic, sustainable changes, which is exactly what helps with reversing prediabetes,” says &lt;a href="https://naturallygoodnutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathryn Durston, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. However, as with all good advice you might find online, you may have to leave some tips that aren't quite the right fit for you. “It’s important to remember that everyone is on their own health journey, and while some changes may work efficiently for certain individuals, others may need additional guidance or support to achieve their goals,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;amp;utm_content=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed., RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taylor’s tip to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2061187/these-are-the-12-most-filling-fruits-and-veggies-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;snack on fruit&lt;/a&gt; can be a smart way to ensure you get enough servings each day. Most of us fall short—only about 12% of US adults eat the recommended 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even better, research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290557/is-eating-fruit-bad-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating more fruit&lt;/a&gt; actually reduces your odds of developing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our experts shared one way to level up your fruit snack: Make it more blood sugar-friendly by pairing it with some protein. “While fruit as a snack is great for fiber and micronutrients, it can still spike blood sugar on its own because it’s mostly carbohydrates. Instead, I recommend &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261071/yogurt-with-blueberries/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pairing fruit with a source of protein&lt;/a&gt; for a more blood-sugar-friendly snack. Add a cheese or meat stick, a strained Greek-style yogurt cup, or a bag of roasted chickpeas alongside your fruit,” says Durston.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Walking After Meals is Spot On &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pairing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet changes with physical activity&lt;/a&gt; doubles down on lowering your risk of prediabetes. Unfortunately, less than a quarter of US adults meet the recommended physical activity levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But the good news is that high-intensity workouts aren’t the only effective way to lower blood sugars, either—lacing up your shoes for an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7998411/walking-after-meals-lower-blood-sugar-science/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;after-meal walk&lt;/a&gt; like Taylor can be just as beneficial. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start where you can, even if it’s for two minutes, and build from there. Increasing your walking time to 10-15 minutes can have an even greater impact on blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians wholeheartedly agreed with Taylor’s tip to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15316/how-to-eat-more-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate more vegetables into your diet&lt;/a&gt;. “Non-starchy vegetables are high in fiber and nutrients while low in calories, which supports better blood sugar control. Eating more of these vegetables can increase satiety and naturally encourage &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290482/what-does-a-healthy-serving-of-carbs-look-like/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smaller portions of carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; at meals,” says Hippley. While Taylor talks about adding more veggies to dinner, there’s no reason to stop there. “Besides more vegetables at dinner, I would recommend incorporating vegetables with lunch, breakfast and snacks whenever possible,” says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Aim for at least 2-3 cups of vegetables per day to boost fiber, fullness and blood sugar balance,” she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond Taylor’s tips, here are some additional lifestyle changes that could help you manage prediabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep likely isn’t top of mind when you’re trying to work on reversing prediabetes, but it’s more important than you might think. “Getting consistent, quality sleep helps regulate hormones, while chronic stress and poor sleep can raise insulin resistance and make blood sugar harder to control,” says Hippley.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portion Control:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to sorting out what to eat after a prediabetes diagnosis, consider how much you’re eating as well. “Focusing on portion control is often one of the first changes I recommend to patients because it allows them to continue enjoying their usual foods, but in a more balanced way,” Hippley explains. “Paying attention to smaller portions of carbohydrate-rich foods while increasing non-starchy vegetables can help manage blood sugar without feeling deprived,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a Healthy Weight:&lt;/strong&gt; Weight loss isn’t always the answer when addressing prediabetes. However, studies show that it can be one tool that may help. “Just a small amount of weight loss, 5-7% of starting weight, can promote lower blood sugar and often reversal of prediabetes,” says Gaw.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No matter the question, the internet has answers (for better or worse). However, when it comes to your health, it’s always worth checking in with an expert before implementing changes. In this case, dietitians had a lot of positive things to say about one Redditor’s experience with reversing their prediabetes. Research supports the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significant impact lifestyle changes can have on diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt; and dietitians appreciated that Taylor’s tips were realistic and sustainable.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peanut butter is highly nutritious—but ingredients matter. Naturally, peanut butter is rich in plant-based protein, healthy fats, fiber, and key nutrients like vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, and antioxidants. But many store brands add sugar, oils, and excess sodium, which can undermine its health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The healthiest peanut butters have &lt;em&gt;one ingredient&lt;/em&gt;: peanuts. Dietitians agree that the best peanut butter is made only from peanuts (and maybe a pinch of salt). Avoid added sugars, hydrogenated oils, palm oil, and preservatives, which can contribute to inflammation and negatively affect heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once Again Organic Peanut Butter is the top RD-recommended brand. It uses only organic roasted peanuts, contains no additives, is ethically sourced, and comes in reusable glass jars. Its clean ingredients and creamy texture make it perfect for both sweet and savory recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you peeked into the pantries of many Americans, chances are you’d find a jar of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/peanut-butter-hacks" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;. This beloved staple is not only delicious in both sweet and savory recipes, but it's also packed with nutrition. “Nutritionally, it’s a powerhouse of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-pantry-staples-8746424" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/dietitians-favorite-high-fiber-foods-11819806" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, perfect for fueling your day,” says Charleston-based registered dietitian Lauren Manaker MS, RDN.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amy Davis, RDN, founder of Amy Davis Nutrition agrees, sharing that “peanut butter has about eight grams of plant-based protein, 14 grams heart-healthy fats, plus two grams fiber per two tablespoon serving.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; All three of these macronutrients support feelings of fullness after eating, as well as blood sugar regulation. Plus, the mono- and polyunsaturated fats in peanut butter bodes well for cholesterol levels—and thus, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/simple-habits-that-keep-your-heart-healthy-11829736" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s also pretty nutrient dense, providing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamins/vitamin-e-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin E,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-potassium-than-bananas-11753287" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/folate-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;folate&lt;/a&gt;, and antioxidants like resveratrol,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” Kristen Carli, MS, RD, dietitian at WOWMD adds. These nutrients support immune, skin, bone, and heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, not all peanut butter brands are created equal when it comes to health benefits—the best contain little besides peanuts, whereas others are chock-full of mystery additives, added sugar, sodium, and more. Here, we’ll explore what makes a peanut butter more or less healthy than another option, and share one brand that stands above the rest.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-when-buying-peanut-butter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What to Look for When Buying Peanut Butter &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you're hunting for a better-for-you peanut butter, it all comes down to the ingredients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Look for a short ingredients list that's made up of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/health-benefits-of-peanuts" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;peanuts&lt;/a&gt; and maybe salt,” says Davis. This helps you avoid many of the unwanted ingredients found in many peanut butters. “Oftentimes, brands add sugar, salt, and oil to peanut butter, which is unnecessary,” Carli explains. Katherine Brooking MS, RD, founder of  Nutrition News Update (NNU) agrees, adding, “just peanuts is all you need.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, you want to steer clear of PB options with added refined sugars, hydrogenated oils, high levels of salt, and mystery ingredients like stabilizers or preservatives that you don’t recognize. This is due to the pro-inflammatory nature of added sugar&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the lack of long-term research on many food additives&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the one-two punch hydrogenated oil&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—aka trans fats—have on heart health, lowering “good” (high-density lipoprotein, HDL) cholesterol and increasing “bad” (low-density lipoprotein, LDL) cholesterol. Even when oils aren’t hydrogenated (or trans fat-based), added oils like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/what-is-palm-oil" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt; aren’t necessary, since peanuts provide plenty of fat on their own. Plus, excessive amounts of sodium intake over long periods of time can contribute to high blood pressure levels, which can strain heart health over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long story short: when it comes to peanut butter the shorter the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ingredients list&lt;/a&gt;, the better. Zero grams of added sugar and less than 75 milligrams of sodium per serving on the nutrition facts panel can confirm this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plenty of brands measure up to these standards; however, &lt;strong&gt;Once Again Creamy Organic Peanut &lt;/strong&gt;Butter wins these RDs’ vote as the healthiest peanut butter.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Once Again is an excellent peanut butter option! The only ingredient is roasted peanuts with no added oils or sugars, which is ideal but hard to find,” shares Davis. Plus, it’s an organic product which is a major added bonus when wanting to prioritize environmentally-conscious eating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brooking also loves this brand, adding, “their peanut butter contains only organic peanuts and it’s super creamy and tastes amazing.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once Again’s sourcing and quality are also majorly impressive. Carli shares, “because this peanut butter does not include other additives, it's a clean choice. I especially love that it is ethically sourced!” And when it comes to ethical sourcing, Manaker adds that this, “means every spoonful supports fair labor and sustainable farming, while the 100 percent employee-owned company behind the brand ensures quality with heart. The glass jar isn’t just charming; it’s a sustainable vessel to keep your peanut butter pure and fresh. Once Again is a dietitian’s dream and a feel-good favorite.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And this peanut butter is ready for any PB recipe you love. “It has great flavor and a smooth texture, which is perfect for drizzling over yogurt bowls, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/benefits-of-oatmeal" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, apples, and more,” offers Davis.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although natural oil separation can be a frustrating feature of low-ingredient peanut butters like Once Again, it can be easily remedied. “If you're frustrated with having to stir your separated peanut butter every time you open the jar, try this hack! When you open a new jar, blend the entire contents in a high-speed blender for about a minute, then transfer it back to the jar. This helps emulsify the peanut butter so the oils stay fully incorporated in the peanut butter, meaning little to no stirring for you,” offers Davis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from those delicious ideas, there are plenty of other ways to use peanut butter in dishes at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Baked goods, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-fruit-smoothie-recipes-7375286" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, chia seed pudding, and energy bites are all delicious sweet treats that benefit from a generous spoonful of peanut butter. Savory recipes are equally enhanced by this nut butter. Sauces, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-make-or-buy-the-healthiest-salad-dressing-11773375" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;salad dressings&lt;/a&gt;, noodle dishes, stir-fries, and even stews become more flavorful with the addition of peanut butter. PB simply spread onto celery (maybe with some raisin “ants”) is also a tasty classic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Moderation is key with this family favorite, however, especially if weight management is a goal. This is due to the high-calorie nature of peanut butter—even though much of it comes from healthy fats—which can add up quickly if not monitored.&lt;br&gt;

Research shows that protein helps maintain lean body mass, supports healthy aging by preventing muscle loss (sarcopenia), and enhances feelings of fullness, which can aid in weight management. It also contributes to stabilizing blood sugar levels, supporting muscle recovery after physical activity, and keeping metabolism active. Protein is involved in hormone production, immune function, and tissue repair. Daily protein requirements vary depending on factors like age, gender, activity level, and overall health, making individualized intake important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26797090/"&gt;general recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for a healthy adult is around 0.8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which is the minimum needed for basic health. &lt;br&gt;For better muscle maintenance, metabolic health, or active lifestyles, recommend protein intake is around&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861013003265"&gt; 1.2 g/kg/day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those involved in&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6090881/"&gt; regular exercise or strength training&lt;/a&gt;, a higher intake around 1.4–2.0 g/kg/day, is suggested to support muscle repair and growth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>数据支持美国目前对新生儿接种乙型肝炎疫苗的政策，因为官员们正在推动变革-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/data-supports-us-policy-hepatitis-b-vaccine-newborns-officials-push-delay-2025-12-02/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:12:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxOSVIydUxQSElybjNaSkcwZnhZVjVCV3dGdWlTZVd0UFFDOElROEZXVzNud2ZfUll6N1pPc05KMU9kUURFa3RTVk80cFFqSTgtM2J4MXJHTV9SNXJrMTc0ODFtUTFXNHJES0JpZllyOWlVVjJEWEdQSjM2QS15b3R6OXdtRGNYTndRLXJ2VDJITWxqaGR5cEt5eXMwc3ZBbmJkQVhRa1hWc09VdWRBclphckNsQkFkWVhXcGJjSlV0ckJsQnh0blM3dVVwSXQ0ZkwwdzdBbjhOZkhHU1cyM2c</guid></item><item><title>心脏病发作提前10年发出警告！早期血压变化如何揭示减少长期汽车的迹象-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/heart-attack-warns-10-years-before-how-early-blood-pressure-changes-reveal-signs-to-reduce-long-term-cardiovascular-risk/articleshow/125714166.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks and cardiovascular diseases remain the leading causes of death worldwide. Millions of people lose their lives each year due to heart-related conditions, often because the early warning signs are unnoticed or ignored. Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, a board-certified cardiologist and functional medicine specialist with over 20 years of experience, highlights the importance of recognising subtle changes in blood pressure as early indicators of heart disease. According to him, these changes can predict heart attacks up to a decade before typical symptoms such as chest pain or fatigue appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large real-world &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.028762" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;examined the long-term cardiovascular risk linked to Stage 1 Hypertension in over 96,000 individuals, with blood pressure measured in 2006 and 2010. The research aimed to estimate both 10-year and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to understand how changes in blood pressure over time affect future risk. Results showed that people with Stage 1 Hypertension had a 35 % higher 10-year risk and a 36 % higher lifetime risk of CVD compared to those with normal blood pressure. Progression to more severe hypertension increased the 10-year risk by over 150 %. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection and management are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early &lt;keyword id="24457019" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-pressure-changes" source="keywords"&gt;blood pressure changes&lt;/keyword&gt; reveal heart stress years before symptoms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, heart attacks are rarely completely sudden. The body often gives subtle signals long before a cardiac event occurs. Many of these signals are related to blood pressure, which reflects the condition of the heart and arteries. Slight, gradual changes in blood pressure over time may indicate that the cardiovascular system is under strain, even if overall readings appear normal during routine check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj explains, “In the past, I treated patients only after they experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or fatigue. By that stage, their cardiovascular system had been under stress for years without anyone noticing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does stage 1 hypertension predict 10-year heart disease risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and clinical experience show that certain patterns in blood pressure can act as early predictors of heart attacks. Dr Bhojraj identifies four key indicators that should not be ignored:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle blood pressure variability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even minor fluctuations in blood pressure across days or weeks can signal that the heart is working harder than normal. These variations may not trigger symptoms but can indicate early vascular ageing and increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning blood pressure surges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure often rises naturally in the morning, but excessive or sharp morning surges are linked to a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Monitoring morning readings can reveal patterns that indicate the cardiovascular system is under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy blood pressure pattern includes a natural dip during sleep. If blood pressure remains elevated at night, it may indicate autonomic dysfunction or early arterial damage, which are significant risk factors for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of autonomic flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, and other essential functions. A decline in its flexibility to adapt to stress or environmental changes may be an early sign of cardiovascular ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj stresses that recognising these patterns requires consistent monitoring over time rather than relying on single measurements at the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of &lt;keyword id="31229210" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-blood-pressure-monitoring" source="keywords"&gt;early blood pressure monitoring&lt;/keyword&gt; in heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pivotal moment in Dr Bhojraj’s career occurred when a patient suffered a sudden heart attack despite having normal cholesterol levels and a stable weight. Upon reviewing the patient’s history, he discovered that subtle blood pressure changes had been occurring for nearly a decade. This case demonstrated that heart disease is often not sudden but develops gradually, and early intervention is possible if risk factors are detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this realisation, Dr Bhojraj shifted his approach from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. He began analysing long-term blood pressure patterns while considering lifestyle factors such as sleep, stress, hormonal balance, and inflammation. This method allows him to identify patients at risk long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of addressing early blood pressure changes for heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing early blood pressure changes, patients can significantly reduce their risk of heart attacks and improve overall health. Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased energy levels and vitality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved metabolic health and weight management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced resilience to physical and mental stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced cardiovascular age and stronger heart function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj emphasises, “Prevention should not be a guessing game. Understanding your cardiovascular future early allows for meaningful changes that protect the heart and improve quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Monitoring blood pressure effectively&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular home monitoring is essential for detecting early warning signs. Automated blood pressure monitors can track readings over time, and maintaining a detailed record allows patients and doctors to observe subtle trends. Dr Bhojraj also recommends considering lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, diet, stress levels, and physical activity, as these directly impact blood pressure patterns and long-term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one children are among 33 people who have died in Cuba of the mosquito-borne chikungunya and dengue viruses since July, authorities said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the deaths were attributed to chikungunya — characterized by fever and joint pain that can be debilitating but rarely fatal — while the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-dengue-fever-virus-symptoms-vaccine-treatment/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu-like dengue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claimed 12 lives, the country's deputy health minister Carilda Pena said on state TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus emerged in Cuba's western Matanzas province in July, but soon spread to all 15 provinces of the country of 9.7 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in Africa in the early 1950s. Chikungunya's symptoms include severe joint aches, fever, and fatigue, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms usually start within three to seven days after a bite from an infected mosquito, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people recover within a week, according to the agency, though some experience severe joint pain for months or even years after their illness. Deaths are rare, the CDC says. Newborns infected around the time of birth, people over 65, and people with preexisting medical conditions are most likely to experience severe illness, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the communist island has been afflicted by an outbreak of dengue that hit as Cuba battles shortages of clean water, food, fuel and medicine during its worst economic crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuba, long known for its medical and pharmaceutical expertise, was able to deal a swift blow to a previous chikungunya outbreak in 2014. There is no specific treatment for the disease, but vaccines are available and recommended for people visiting an area experiencing an outbreak, the CDC says. The disease can't be spread from person to person.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the one-party state reports, the outbreak spiraled out of control due to "lack of hygiene, accumulated garbage" and people storing water in tanks to mitigate the intermittent availability of clean tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the country under U.S. sanctions and its critical tourism sector left in ruins by Covid, a dearth of foreign currency has seen a steep decline in Cuba's medical services and prevention programs such as mosquito fumigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC has issued &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices#travel-notice-definitions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;travel notices&lt;/a&gt; for Americans traveling to countries with chikungunya outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-cuba" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;including Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, advising them to practice increased precautions, including getting vaccinated for chikungunya and taking steps to stave off mosquitoes. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-warns-travelers-chikungunya-virus-mosquitoes-china/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and countries near the Indian Ocean, including Madagascar and Kenya, have also been named in travel notices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York saw its &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/locally-acquired-chikungunya-case-confirmed-in-new-york/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;first-ever locally acquired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; case of chikungunya in October 2025. It was the first such case reported in the U.S. since 2019. Multiple other chikungunya cases have been reported in the U.S., but they were linked to international travel. &lt;/p&gt;
