While the drug has been a powerful tool to contain the virus, inequities remain in accessing those drugs and sustaining a daily treatment. Despite major progress, there are still 30,000 new infections each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many of the terminated HIV-related studies focused on improving access to drugs like PrEP in communities that have higher rates of infections – including trans women and Black men. One of Marcus’s projects was examining whether making PrEP available over the counter would increase the use of the drug in vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The research has to focus on the populations that are most affected in order to have an impact and be relevant,” said Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yet, this may be the justification for defunding so many HIV-related studies. A termination letter reviewed by the Guardian dated 20 March cited that “so-called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) studies are often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Scrapping an entire category of disease from research will have innumerable downstream effects on the rest of healthcare&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Erin Kahle, University of Michigan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; did not expand on why the grants were terminated in response to questions from the Guardian.

We remain dedicated to restoring our agency to its tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many researchers were left stunned by the scale of the cancellations since in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-state-union-address-2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in his State of the Union address a commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the country over the next 10 years. As part of this initiative, his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt; negotiated a deal with drug companies to provide free PrEP for 200,000 low-income patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach,” said Trump in his address. “Together we will defeat Aids in America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8ca2f65f-63f0-4233-916e-329e08f8075f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Aid cuts predicted to cause 2.9 million more HIV-related deaths by 2030 – study","elementId":"8ca2f65f-63f0-4233-916e-329e08f8075f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/26/aid-cuts-pepfar-epidemic-prediction-cause-29-million-more-hiv-related-deaths-by-2030-lancet-study"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Amy Nunn, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she had even tailored grant proposals to fit the policy goals of the initiative, which included geographically targeting HIV prevention efforts. One of her studies that was terminated last week focused on closing disparities of PrEP use among African American men in Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“They finally adopted those policies at the federal level,” Nunn said, noting that Trump was the first president to make ending the epidemic a priority. “Now they’re undercutting their own successes. It’s so strange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The total amount of NIH funds allocated to supporting the 65 grants was $35m. Canceling the grants will not recoup all of that money for the administration, since many are years into their work. Some are even already finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nathaniel Albright learned last Tuesday that an NIH grant supporting his doctoral research was cancelled even though his project had already been completed. A PhD candidate at Ohio State University, Albright is defending his dissertation at the end of the month. Still, Albright is concerned how the cuts impact the future of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s created an environment in academia where my research trajectory is now considered high risk to institutions,” said Albright, who is currently struggling to find postdoctorate positions at universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Pamina Gorbach, an epidemiologist who teaches at University of California, Los Angeles, had been following hundreds of men living with HIV in Los Angeles for 10 years to learn their needs. She had been awarded an NIH grant to better facilitate their treatment through a local clinic. Her funding was cancelled last week as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s really devastating,” said Gorbach. “If you’re living with HIV and you’re not on meds, you know what happens? You get sick and you die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="acb3dd82-8517-4629-a090-114be722086e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":20,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"US urged to ‘think bigger’ on healthcare amid Trump onslaught on sector","elementId":"acb3dd82-8517-4629-a090-114be722086e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/22/us-healthcare-trump"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Clinic staff in Los Angeles will likely be laid off as a result of the cuts, said Gorbach. Others agreed one immediate concern was how to pay their research staff, since the funds from a grant are immediately frozen once it is terminated.

			&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is usually associated with old age. But &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet"&gt;around 5%-10% of all Alzheimer's cases&lt;/a&gt; occur in people under the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/younger-early-onset"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; progresses more rapidly and often strikes people in the prime of their lives. Treatment options remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But new data from a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2825%2900024-9/abstract"&gt;recent clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a previously discontinued experimental drug, called gantenerumab, could help. The study found that gantenerumab reduced the buildup of amyloid plaques – one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease – in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may help slow cognitive decline in people with early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is often linked to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5871104/"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; in three specific genes. These mutations cause the brain to produce excessive amounts of amyloid beta, a protein that clumps together to form plaques. These plaques disrupt brain function, leading to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's advances quickly – and the rapid decline is devastating. That's why researchers are racing to find treatments that can slow the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid plaques (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3tpYQR4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; was a randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate gantenerumab's effects on people with early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers monitored changes in the participants' cognitive abilities, and also used brain imaging and blood biomarkers (the presence of specific proteins in the blood which are linked to Alzheimer's), to track the disease's progress throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial included 73 participants with rare inherited genetic mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer's. These participants were either asymptomatic or had mild Alzheimer's symptoms at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were intriguing. In a subgroup of 22 participants, who hadn't had any cognitive issues at the start of the study, taking the treatment for an average of eight years reduced the risk of developing symptoms from a nearly 100% likelihood, to 50%. Brain scans also showed a notable decrease in amyloid buildup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immune defenders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/gantenerumab"&gt;Gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt; is a monoclonal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; – a lab-engineered protein designed to attach to amyloid beta in the brain. By binding to these plaques, it signals the immune system to clear them away. This may potentially slow Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug works by engaging &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22613055/"&gt;microglial cells&lt;/a&gt;. These are the brain's primary immune defenders. Microglia constantly monitor the brain for damage and remove harmful substances, including amyloid beta. However, in people with Alzheimer's disease, microglia often &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-020-00435-y"&gt;fail to clear plaques efficiently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gantenerumab enhances this natural defence mechanism by tagging amyloid plaques, making them easier for the microglia to recognise and break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid beta is thought to play a central role in Alzheimer's by triggering inflammation, interfering with cell communication and ultimately killing neurons. By removing these plaques, gantenerumab may help to protect brain function. However, it doesn't reverse existing damage – which is why early intervention is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of gantenerumab is that it can cross the &lt;a href="https://fluidsbarrierscns.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12987-020-00230-3"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; – the protective shield that blocks many drugs and harmful substances from reaching the brain. This allows it to act directly on amyloid plaques, making it more effective than some earlier treatments that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2756824/"&gt;struggled with drug delivery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as promising as these results are, gantenerumab isn't without risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major concern is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10629981/"&gt;amyloid-related imaging abnormalities&lt;/a&gt;. These are swelling or small spots of bleeding in the brain that show up on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="156759" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans. This is a common side-effect of amyloid-targeting therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this latest trial, 53% of participants experienced these amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, including small brain bleeds in 27% of participants, brain swelling in 30% of participants and iron deposits from bleeding in 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no participants had major brain haemorrhages or died from the treatment, these side-effects remain a serious concern – requiring regular monitoring through brain scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the modest cognitive benefit observed in the trial. While gantenerumab reduced amyloid plaques, the extent to which this translates into meaningful improvements in memory and thinking skills remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gantenerumab is also expensive to manufacture, which could make widespread access difficult if it gains regulatory approval. As this is an experimental drug, we do not currently know how much it would cost. But other similar anti-amyloid therapies, such as donanemab, currently cost around &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1e7pllez0xo"&gt;£25,000 per patient per year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also had a small sample size and only focused on a rare genetic form of early-onset Alzheimer's. More research is needed to see how these results may apply to the wider dementia community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future of treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the trial was terminated early after the study's sponsor pulled out, these findings contribute to the ongoing debate over the causes of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain is the main cause of Alzheimer's disease. Clearing these plaques will slow the disease's progression. The success of the Alzheimer's drugs &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/lecanemab-leqembi"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/donanemab"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt; and now gantenerumab, lend themselves to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study also underscores the importance of early diagnosis. Amyloid-targeting therapies appear to work best in the early stages of Alzheimer's, before &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00756-8#:%7E:text=Clinical%20trials%20generally%20enrol%20early,before%20the%20disease%20takes%20hold."&gt;significant brain damage occurs&lt;/a&gt;. Advances in biomarker testing – including &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/uk-wide-study-into-dementia-blood-tests-recruits-first-participants/"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; and brain scans – could help identify at-risk people sooner. This would improve the effectiveness of drugs such as gantenerumab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gantenerumab is not a cure and &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimer-europe.org/news/roche-discontinues-clinical-trials-gantenerumab-after-graduate-studies-fail-meet-their-primary?language_content_entity=en"&gt;was discontinued&lt;/a&gt; by its manufacturer in 2022 because it failed to demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, this new data could perhaps lead to gantenerumab being manufactured again. It also represents another step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's research is advancing faster than ever before. Whether a success or a setback, each new study adds to our understanding of the disease and brings us closer to more effective treatments. For now, the gantenerumab trial offers a hopeful sign that scientists are making progress in slowing the course of this devastating condition.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253049/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 6-7
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight. You will walk away with a 17-page report detailing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts will review the results of the scan with you, correlate its findings with your health history. This provides a tremendous amount of information allowing him to make valuable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be able to fill out a proprietary survey that will give you insight into health issues that likely compromise your weight loss efforts. Thousands of KSL readers have taken this survey and been amazed at the information it provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no obligation.

			&lt;p&gt;Cases of the fungal infection &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_auris"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are rising rapidly and coming from more sources too, a new US study reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; was first reported in the US &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-deadly-drug-resistant-fungus-has-arrived-in-the-us"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and is considered an "urgent antimicrobial resistance threat" in hospitals, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on a large health system in Miami, Florida, the new research found that reported clinical cases had risen from 5 in 2019 to 115 in 2023 – a considerable jump of 2,200 percent in four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consistent with US national trends, &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; rapidly spread in our community as noted by a sharp increase in the identification of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; from clinical cultures in 2020 and 2021, followed by a less steep rise in 2022 and 2023," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the US team in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many strains of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genome-study-reveals-this-deadly-fungus-has-been-having-sneaky-sex"&gt;don't respond to regular treatments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/hcp/infection-control/index.html"&gt;and are resistant&lt;/a&gt; to common cleaners and disinfectants too. The fungus spreads quickly in hospitals, often via equipment like catheters and breathing and feeding tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AkI5NeD4Ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it takes hold, a &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infection can cause various serious &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65055878"&gt;and even fatal illnesses&lt;/a&gt; in the bloodstream, the respiratory system, the central nervous system, in organs, and in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus doesn't pose much risk to the general public. Most healthy people are unlikely to pick up an infection as they're less exposed to C. auris, and their bodies are better able to repel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for people who are already ill and in the hospital, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fungal-pathogens-are-mutating-dangerously-as-the-world-gets-hotter"&gt;growing threat&lt;/a&gt; is a very real one. Bloodstream infections continue to be the most common, but infections in soft tissue or bone, and in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, are increasing. The more bases there are to cover, the harder &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; will be to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean.jpg" alt="Hospital cleaning" class="wp-image-156397 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HospitalClean-600x339.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The CDC has issued guidelines for limiting &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; spread. (CDC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern that's emerging in the US is being repeated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-across-the-world-and-we-don-t-know-how-to-stop-it"&gt;across the rest of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and health experts have been struggling to contain &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; since it was first discovered in Japan in 2009. The first US cases were reported in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-fungus-could-be-linked-to-climate-change-study-suggests"&gt;warnings have been issued&lt;/a&gt; about the threat posed by &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; – including a study released &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-deadly-superfungus-can-now-be-found-in-half-of-us-states"&gt;almost exactly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that infections had reached half of the states in the US – but as this Miami study shows, the surge is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/hcp/infection-control/index.html"&gt;has a lengthy list of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for stopping the spread of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infections, including diligent cleaning routines for surfaces and devices, and the use of single-patient rooms where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measures to prevent the spread of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; rely on isolation and contact precautions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that early identification of patients colonized with &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; and the prompt deployment of infection prevention strategies can potentially impact the incidence of bloodstream infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2025.03.013"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Infection Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hyperfocusing on the same task for hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Microgen / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have ADHD, starting tasks can be a grind — especially tasks you find daunting or believe will be time-consuming — but once you get started, you might find yourself so absorbed by what you’re doing that other important tasks end up neglected as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hyperfocus is a symptom that can easily be missed because it looks like the person is only motivated to do certain activities,” O’Shea said. “It’s sometimes mistaken as selfishness and overzealousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Difficulty switching gears is thought to be caused by low dopamine levels in the brain: The more engrossed you are in a task, the greater the dopamine boost. It’s similar to being in the zone, only in this context, it feels like you’re trapped there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hyperfocus at its worst can look like writing and rewriting your response to a simple email and being unable to transition to a new task or missing an important event because you’re unable to pull yourself away from a work project,” Louk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.

As a result, you might use food as a way to unconsciously cope with boredom and emotional distress — or get sucked into a task to the point where you forget to eat for hours, thanks to feeling disconnected from your body’s hunger and fullness cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

&lt;p&gt;With everything there is to juggle in life, it’s easy to assume that everyone experiences that sinking-in-quicksand feeling as they navigate another busy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you find this feeling is paired with extreme levels of disorganization, inattention and overwhelm, these might be signs of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://chadd.org/for-adults/overview/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;10 million American adults&lt;/a&gt; (and over &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916320/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;365 million globally&lt;/a&gt;) are thought to have ADHD — and because symptoms can show up differently in adults, realizing you might have the disorder is typically a slow burn, the overlooked signs of which can cause significant strain on your life and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adults looking for diagnosis often have many subtle signs rather than completely failing,” &lt;a href="https://brainandmind.org" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dede O’Shea&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist at &lt;a href="https://physicians.lahey.org/details/4345/dede-oshea-psychiatry__behavioral_medicine-burlington" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Beth Israel Lahey Health&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hallmark symptoms of ADHD — inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity — typically aren’t as noticeable in adulthood, likely because adults whose ADHD wasn’t diagnosed in childhood have had a lifetime to parse together the skills necessary to compensate for their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some symptoms of ADHD also mimic those of anxiety or depression,” &lt;a href="https://www.peacehumanistic.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7852141" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Cristina Louk&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Washington state, told HuffPost. “Most people will first get diagnosed with these disorders and get frustrated when treatment fails to alleviate their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the moment, you might find yourself attributing certain feelings and behaviors to other things — blaming feelings of hype on too much coffee or snapping at your frozen computer on sleep deprivation — when really, they’re symptoms of adult ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the sneakier signs you might be overlooking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

The technology, known as N-Tidal Diagnose, uses carbon dioxide sensors and AI to analyse a patient's normal breathing patterns, delivering results in just minutes. The rollout is expected to extend to the rest of the UK soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, COPD diagnosis relies on spirometry, a time-consuming procedure requiring patients to forcefully exhale into a device. Appointments can take between 30 and 90 minutes. N-Tidal Diagnose simplifies this process significantly, measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in normal breaths and providing a diagnosis within five minutes. This efficiency has led medical professionals to hail the device as "game-changing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPD encompasses a group of lung conditions, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, that cause breathing difficulties. The N-Tidal Diagnose device has received regulatory clearance and CE-marking under EU Medical Device Regulations for COPD diagnosis. Its developer, TidalSense, is also exploring its potential for asthma diagnosis. This innovative technology promises to transform COPD diagnosis, offering a quicker, more convenient, and potentially more accurate method for detecting this prevalent lung condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ameera Patel, chief executive of TidalSense, said: “For decades, respiratory diagnostics have lagged behind other areas of medicine, despite lung disease being one of the UK’s greatest healthcare challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The N-Tidal Diagnose device represents the first real breakthrough in COPD diagnosis in several decades, addressing both the needs of the patient and of the health system – and it’s designed to be deployed at scale across the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make respiratory diagnosis fast, accurate, and accessible to everyone who needs it, at the instant that they present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 bqSiOl"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/30/17/28/01JQJYWRY0XW9K22ZQJAKF2X0P-(1).jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/30/17/28/01JQJYWRY0XW9K22ZQJAKF2X0P-(1).jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/30/17/28/01JQJYWRY0XW9K22ZQJAKF2X0P-(1).jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Simon Rudland, a GP in Suffolk, showing the N-Tidal Diagnose test to a patient" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-230636"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Dr Simon Rudland, a GP in Suffolk, showing the N-Tidal Diagnose test to a patient&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (TidalSense/PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated about 1.2 million people in the UK have COPD, with as many as two million people undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Patel claims the test could help the Government meet its goal of slashing NHS waiting times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “The NHS is under immense pressure and the Government has laid out ambitious plans to change the way services are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its targets against reducing waiting times and using staff time more efficiently will be easier to meet with the introduction of new tools like N-Tidal Diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This simple device can help significantly reduce waiting lists, improve patient experience, deliver accurate diagnoses and ultimately provide a better standard of care for the millions of people in the UK who have COPD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;N-Tidal is also being tested for asthma, with the hopes it will one day be used to diagnose the condition once research trials are complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Simon Rudland, a GP in Suffolk, hailed the test as a “game changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COPD is one of the most underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed conditions we see in the NHS, and because spirometry testing can only be carried out by specially trained practitioners, it can lead to sizeable wait lists for diagnosis,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having the ability to assess a patient’s lung health quickly and accurately with a device that gives near-instant results will be game-changing for respiratory care across both primary and secondary healthcare settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 23:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOOFFOUjVHNXN6cFpORmJJWHk5bV85UzVVM2hHYUpnX01PaUtxRThXV2NIV29oOVRYeDBNUDdyaTFzV3NRNUIteTZ1NUoyRnlIazVMWWpBcGtKZVhnVHJ2bjVtejBZVFMzODAtU2JRR0dqalpoR1B5UXpZNV9hM3FUQ19DTllHWHc</guid></item><item><title>Researchers Discover New Mechanism for Rapid Liver Regeneration to Restore Damaged Livers - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOTFhXZkJrd1hheG9IVDVZQ0J0d2VsUVQ0WWpuRldyUzViWTlmZXBacDhHUE0teExVS0ZHU0FhU1BKc2NTcU05dy11YnpIMkluVXhXNHFrMzRDX2NrbTFnY1FYRGNzZi1zZGxsbDBZX19ocGZVeS1UX01MQXpPV3hSM3dGOGhrWWZUZy1PeE9rWVhVYUk5dEY5YjUyNXBzWS1mNjZ0RDZCT2MwblpqWF9uMkhOZ1ZDeE00YVRocWtzVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Cancer Research Centre in Spain (CNIO) have discovered a mechanism that is triggered just minutes after acute liver damage occurs—and it could lead to treatments for those with severe liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The avenues for future treatments of liver damage include a diet enriched with the amino acid glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Glutamate supplementation can promote liver regeneration and benefit patients in recovery following hepatectomy or awaiting a transplant,” wrote the authors&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08778-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; in a paper published&lt;/a&gt; in ‘Nature’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver is a vital organ, crucial to digestion, metabolism, and the elimination of toxins. It has a unique ability to regenerate, which allows it to replace liver cells damaged by the very toxins that these cells eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the liver stops regenerating in cases of diseases that involve chronic liver damage–such as cirrhosis—and such diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent, associated with poor dietary habits or alcohol consumption. So activating liver regeneration is key to treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning to activate liver regeneration is therefore a priority today, to benefit patients with liver damage and also those who’ve had part of their liver cut out to remove a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has discovered in animal models this previously unknown mechanism of liver regeneration. It is a process that is triggered very quickly, just a few minutes after acute liver damage occurs, with the amino acid glutamate playing a key role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results describe a fundamental and universal mechanism that allows the liver to regenerate after acute damage,” explained Nabil Djouder, head of the CNIO Growth Factors, Nutrients and Cancer Group and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANOTHER BREAKTHROUGH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Edible Carbon Beads Can Reduce Cirrhosis Liver Disease By Restoring Gut Microbiome" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/edible-carbon-beads-can-reduce-cirrhosis-liver-disease-by-restoring-gut-microbiome/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Edible Carbon Beads Can Reduce Cirrhosis Liver Disease By Restoring Gut Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A “complex and ingenious” perspective on liver regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver regeneration was known to occur through the proliferation of liver cells, known as hepatocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms involved were not fully understood. This current discovery is very novel, as it describes communication between two different organs, the liver and bone marrow, involving the immune system, &lt;a href="https://www.cnio.es/en/news/cnio-researchers-discover-a-new-mechanism-for-rapid-liver-regeneration-triggered-by-glutamate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a CINO news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that liver and bone marrow are interconnected by glutamate. After acute liver damage, liver cells, called hepatocytes, produce glutamate and send it into the bloodstream; through the blood, glutamate reaches the bone marrow, inside the bones, where it activates monocytes, a type of immune system cell. Monocytes then travel to the liver and along the way become macrophages – also immune cells. The presence of glutamate reprograms the metabolism of macrophages, and these consequently begin to secrete a growth factor that leads to an increase in hepatocyte production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a rapid chain of events allows glutamate to trigger liver regeneration in just minutes, through changes in the macrophage metabolism. It is, says Djouder, “a new, complex and ingenious perspective on how the liver stimulates its own regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also clarifies a previously unanswered question: how the various areas of the liver are coordinated during regeneration. In the liver, there are different types of hepatocytes, organized in different areas; the hepatocytes in each area perform specific metabolic functions. The study reveals that hepatocytes producing a protein known as glutamine synthetase, which regulates glutamate levels, play a key role in regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE PROGRESS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Tumor-Destroying Sound Waves Treatment Coming to a Hospital Near You For Liver Cancer" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tumor-destroying-sound-waves-treatment-coming-to-a-hospital-near-you-for-liver-cancer/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Tumor-Destroying Sound Waves Treatment Coming to a Hospital Near You For Liver Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CNIO group, when glutamine synthetase is inhibited, there is more glutamate in circulation, which accelerates liver regeneration. This is what happens when the liver suffers acute damage: glutamine synthase activity decreases, blood glutamate increases, and from there, the connection with the bone marrow is established, reprogramming macrophages and stimulating hepatocyte proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible therapeutic applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments have been carried out in mice, but the results have been tested with bioinformatics tools, using databases of mouse and human hepatocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Djouder, “&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4l4mjlP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dietary glutamate supplementation&lt;/a&gt; may simply be recommended in the future after liver extirpation, and also to reduce liver damage caused by cirrhosis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAFFEINE ALERT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Coffee is Now Linked to Reduced Risk of Many Ailments, Including Liver Disease, Parkinson’s, Melanoma, Even Suicide" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/all-of-coffees-beneficial-effects-liver-disease-cancers-obesity/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Coffee is Now Linked to Reduced Risk of Many Ailments, Including Liver Disease, Parkinson’s, Melanoma, Even Suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first author of the paper, CNIO researcher María del Mar Rigual also wants future research to explore using glutamate supplements in humans who have undergone liver resection for tumor removal.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The developmental progress from daredevil teen to risk-averse senior is more complex than we thought, according to a new study that identified changing relationships between neural structures related to risk avoidance at different life stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, led an investigation into a critical part of the brain that help us determine whether we ought 'take the leap' or avoid life-threatening danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ours isn't the only species where adolescents engage in markedly risky behaviors – a pattern that's at odds with protecting ones' survival at all costs. Other animals, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00006-X"&gt;such as mice&lt;/a&gt; for example, share this trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These behaviors may compete with the drive to avo&lt;span&gt;id threatening situations, leading to a reduction in avoidance behaviors in PMA (platform-mediated avoidance assays)," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in their new paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Here, we uncover a circuit mechanism that causally contributes to lower levels of threat avoidance in adolescence."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying the brains of mice, they found the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsomedial_prefrontal_cortex"&gt;dorso-medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (dmPFC) 'referees' neural pathways that take on distinct structures at certain points throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's as if the prefrontal cortex – the part of the brain credited for our ability to steer our emotional meat ship on a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/147/3/794/7424860"&gt;more deliberate course&lt;/a&gt; – is negotiating with the structures that advocate for what we might call 'instinct' (the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basolateral_amygdala"&gt;basolateral amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, or BA, being the locus of fear and pain memory; the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;, NA, being crucial to reward, reinforcement and aversion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These negotiations, the experiments showed, depend greatly on age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an experiment reminiscent of James Dean's game of 'chicken run' in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtEp7zFdrc"&gt;Rebel without a cause&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;mice were trained to step on a platform to dodge a threat; a decision made more difficult with a smorgasbord laid out in front of them just out of reach of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing very well how to escape the beep they'd come to associate with an electric shock, juvenile and adolescent mice chose to take their chances and keep on eating for longer, while older mice generally stepped dutifully onto the platform, waiting until the threat had passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A&lt;span&gt;lthough mice of all ages had similar levels of conditioned fear and some exploratory behaviors during the retrieval test, juveniles and adolescents explored the threatening part of the environment more than adults," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fluorescent molecules injected into the test subjects' brains allowed the researchers to track the physiology underpinning these behaviors. Higher levels of glowing molecules generally indicate greater amounts of neural activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Activating genes using light through a process of optogenetics revealed further details on how activity in these brain structures related to threat avoidance strategies in juvenile, adolescent and adult mice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155753" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model.jpg" alt="three similar diagrams showing dmPFC, nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdyla connections at juvenile, adolescent and adult stages." class="size-full wp-image-155753" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model.jpg 1509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-642x197.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-1024x314.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-768x236.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/threat-avoidance-model-600x184.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1509px) 100vw, 1509px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155753" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Proposed model of the development of dmPFC circuits underlying threat avoidance. Further detail &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w/figures/8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Klune et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dmPFC, it turns out, becomes more sensitive to threats with age. Much like aging in the rest of the body, however, changes in the structure's configuration occur in staggered stages characterized by maturation of synapses and re-arrangement of the circuits connecting the&lt;span&gt; BA and NA. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's risk-avoidance system may be wired to best suit age-specific challenges as they arise, prioritizing risk when the nest is getting too crowded, and safety when it comes time to settle down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mouse study, so it's not clear if these same patterns hold true for humans. But, as mammals, we aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;far-removed from mice&lt;/a&gt;, providing us with a proxy understanding of how our own brains might navigate the tug-of-war between rewarding risk and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The lack of studies on the causal functions of the mPFC, BLA and NAc circuits in the developing brain has left a major gap in our understanding of how interactions between these regions produce developmental transitions in threat-induced behaviors," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;In revealing the processes by which top-down circuit maturation guides changes in threat-induced behaviors, we establish a foundation to understand how they can become disrupted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past neuroscience and psychology studies have shown that after the human brain encodes specific events or information, it can periodically reactivate them to facilitate their retention, via a process known as memory consolidation. The reactivation of memories has been specifically studied in the context of sleep or rest, with findings suggesting that during periods of inactivity, the brain reactivates specific memories, allowing people to remember them in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions in the United States recently conducted a study exploring the possibility that the brain engages in a similar reactivation process during wakefulness to store important information for shorter periods of time. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01884-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the spontaneous reactivation of specific stimuli in the brain during the brief intervals between their encoding predicts the accuracy with which people remember them at the end of a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mike Kahana and I were both quite interested in the long history of thinking about rehearsal and its effects on the way in which people later recalled things," Dr. David Halpern, the first author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "Rehearsal is challenging to study since people often do it without any overt behavior (unless we ask them to rehearse out loud)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael J. Kahana's lab at the University of Pennsylvania has been conducting studies related to memory processes for some time. This led to the creation of a dataset that includes memory task performance and matching intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from several people, offering insight into what happens in the brain while people attempt to remember information for short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We decided to try to look at when neural activity related to specific words seemed to be reactivated while they were looking at other words and see if that looked like what theorists in psychology thought was going on," said Dr. Halpern. "In addition, there is this parallel literature on consolidation in neuroscience that also suggested that reactivation was key to understanding what gets remembered later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies and theoretical psychology models suggest that memory consolidation processes primarily take place during sleep and over extended periods of rest. During these periods, the brain is not actively engaged in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/everyday+activities/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;everyday activities&lt;/a&gt; and external perceptions, but rather focused on internal thoughts or processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition, past works suggest that certain neurotransmitters are involved in long timescales, much longer than the time between two-word presentations," said Dr. Halpern. "This meant that looking at neural reinstatement in our data would also have interesting implications for those theories as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers analyzed the data collected by the Kahana Lab, which measured neural activity using intracranial EEG. This is a technique that relies on implanted electrodes, which some patients diagnosed with epilepsy are already exposed to as part of their treatment (i.e., to identify the brain tissue that should be surgically removed to diminish or entirely stop their epileptic seizures).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"These patients need to wait in the hospital until they get enough measurements to determine the source, so a network of our research assistants across the country asked them if they would be willing to do a memory task while their neural activity is being recorded," explained Dr. Halpern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The task we usually use is called free recall: we ask the patients to look at a sequence of words on a screen and then, after a short delay, recall as many of them as they can in any order."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Halpern, Dr. Kahana and their collaborators combined intracranial EEG recordings collected while patients were completing a short-term memory task with their performance on the task (i.e., what they remembered and the order in which they remembered stimuli). The study participants' ability to recall information and the order in which they remember it offers valuable insight into how memories are organized in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Firstly, we found that there seems to be some process happening involving reinstatement of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; on a sub-second scale that is related to later memory performance," said Dr. Halpern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a way in which the brain/mind can, after having an experience, make it more likely to be remembered later and perhaps alter the way in which it is remembered. It is interesting that the processes are, at first glance, quite similar to what we think is going on during sleep."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the initial findings gathered by this team of researchers suggest that the brain also re-activates stimuli that we are trying to remember over short periods of time while we are awake. Further research could help to better understand the brain re-activation processes they observed and determine how they differ from those associated with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory+consolidation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt; during sleep or rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, these results could also help devise interventions aimed at improving people's ability to remember information in the short-term, which could be beneficial for both students and people diagnosed with memory disorders. Dr. Halpern has now left the Kahana Lab and now works in another research lab that is exploring the connections between memory and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am very interested in the way in which rehearsal and reinstatement might be involved in the evaluation process that leads us to make a choice," added Dr. Halpern. "Another question I am quite interested in exploring is, if we are routinely (perhaps subconsciously) rehearsing our past experiences, how does our brain keep these separate from our ongoing veridical perceptual experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In theory, this should cause some interference in terms of remembering the order in which things happened, but this doesn't seem to be the case, even in our data."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hair loss affects millions, yet treatments remain frustratingly complex. Some require a daily commitment, others have side effects—and many simply don’t work for everyone. But scientists may have uncovered a simple hair loss cure that’s been hiding in plain sight: sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just any sugar, though. This new cure is heavily based on one that’s already part of your DNA. Researchers from the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University were studying how a natural sugar called deoxyribose helps heal wounds in mice.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During those experiments, they noticed something odd: fur near the treated areas was growing back faster and thicker than expected. That accidental observation turned into a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full"&gt;focused study&lt;/a&gt; on what would become one of the simplest hair loss cures scientists have developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the sugar’s &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/an-actual-cure-for-male-pattern-baldness-may-have-been-discovered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potential for treating hereditary-patterned baldness&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers created a gel infused with deoxyribose and applied it to mice with testosterone-induced hair loss. Within weeks, the treated skin began to sprout new fur—dense, long, and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment.

Image source: goodluz/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results weren’t subtle either. In fact, the sugar gel matched the effectiveness of minoxidil, a popular over-the-counter treatment also known as Rogaine. What makes this finding even more compelling is how safe and accessible it could be as a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/the-key-to-a-permanent-cure-for-baldness-may-have-been-discovered/"&gt;hair loss treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deoxyribose is already a naturally occurring sugar in the body, and the gel developed by the research team is biodegradable and non-toxic. In photos comparing different treatments, mice given the sugar gel showed regrowth as strong as those given minoxidil—without needing to combine the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noticed that the sugar in the simple hair loss cure appeared to increase blood vessel growth and skin cell activity around the hair follicles. Since better blood supply often translates to healthier, thicker hair, this may be one reason the treatment worked so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examined under a microscope, the regrown hairs were visibly thicker than those in the control groups. While it’s not yet clear exactly how deoxyribose triggers this response, the findings are promising—especially given the limited options currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple hair loss cure could potentially help treat alopecia or even aid hair regrowth after chemotherapy. And because it’s built on a naturally occurring molecule, it might offer a gentler alternative for those who can’t tolerate existing medications.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the team is focused on understanding how the sugar works and whether these results can be replicated in humans. But the early signs suggest that an easier, safer approach to treating hair loss could be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

But here’s the kicker: the process isn’t as slow and steady as most of us thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive study reveals some eye-opening insights about aging, focusing on exactly “when” things start to shift and how our bodies begin to break down, both inside and out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging isn’t just about wrinkles and gray hairs – there’s a whole internal, built-in timeline, surprisingly similar for all humans, that we’re only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-the-human-body-start-to-age"&gt;When the human body start to age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man at the helm of the study is Michael Snyder, chair of genetics at &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. His team’s research provides some fascinating insights into the specifics of our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-delays-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological aging process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his team explored data from individuals ranging from 25 to 75 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research focused on the different molecules playing significant roles in aging, including those constituting our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-your-fingerprint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; – the microcosm of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that exist within us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they discovered that 81% of these molecules don’t follow a predictable, chronological pattern as one might expect. Instead, our bodies experience two periods of rapid change as we age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp molecular and microbial shifts occur precisely at ages 44 and 60, a finding that may alter our understanding of how our bodies age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-microbiome-the-basics"&gt;Understanding the microbiome – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your microbiome is basically the bustling community of trillions of microbes – like bacteria, fungi, and viruses – that live in and on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of them live in your gut, especially in your large intestine, and they’re not just there for lack of anywhere better to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help you digest food, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-meat-less-protein-lacks-certain-nutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorb nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, and even produce vitamins like B12 and K. Think of them as your behind-the-scenes health squad, working 24/7 to keep things running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiome also plays a huge role in your immune system, mood, and even how your brain functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the balance of good and bad microbes gets thrown off – like from antibiotics, stress, or a poor diet – it can mess with everything from your energy levels to how well you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why you hear so much buzz about probiotics, fermented foods, and fiber. They’re like fuel for your inner ecosystem, helping your microbiome thrive and keeping you feeling your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-between-aging-and-diseases"&gt;Correlation between aging and diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules related to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, a leading cause of death worldwide, showed substantial changes at both of these age intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, molecules connected to our immune function – our body’s vital defense mechanism against disease – changed significantly in individuals entering their early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were driven to investigate these trends after noticing a sharp rise in the risk of developing age-related conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-why-some-brains-resist-alzheimers-disease-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease during mid-life, rather than a steady increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-age-and-the-human-body"&gt;Studying age and the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings are based on data obtained from 108 participants, aiming to unlock the mysteries of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-could-be-the-key-to-better-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biology of aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several years, participants’ biological samples were analyzed every few months, allowing the scientists to track an astonishing 135,000 age-related changes in different molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered thousands of molecules and microbes that undergo shifts, either increasing or decreasing in their abundance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 81 percent of the molecules studied experienced dramatic changes at specific ages. Notably, these transformations were most prevalent when participants were in their mid-40s and early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiaotao Shen, who was part of the Stanford Medicine team, pointed out significant changes in the number of molecules related to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetics-behind-different-levels-alcohol-consumption-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, and lipid metabolism; cardiovascular disease; and skin and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/molecule-in-coffee-trigonelline-keeps-muscles-young/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt; in individuals in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those in their 60s, changes were observed in carbohydrate and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-coffee-good-for-you-it-may-depend-on-your-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caffeine metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, immune regulation, kidney function, cardiovascular disease, and skin and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-lifestyle-a-factor"&gt;Is lifestyle a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could our lifestyles be contributing to these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/losing-loved-ones-can-speed-up-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age-related changes&lt;/a&gt;? Snyder suggests it’s a possibility worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, alcohol metabolism may falter due to the increased alcohol consumption that often occurs in people’s mid-40s, a decade frequently marked by significant life stressors such as career changes, family obligations, or personal challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in behavior can lead to a cascade of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physiological changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists plan to delve deeper into the various triggers for these periods of rapid change, exploring how factors like diet, exercise, and stress management interplay with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these connections could pave the way for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/harvard-scientists-fountain-of-youth-pill-sparks-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthier aging strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-genetics-in-aging"&gt;Role of genetics in aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside our environment and lifestyle choices, our genes significantly impact &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exposure-certain-odors-pheromones-speeds-up-aging-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how we age&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone has a unique genetic blueprint that can make them more susceptible to certain health issues as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some gene variations can affect how well our bodies break down substances, handle stress, and even heal from injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding these genetic markers, we can gain valuable insights into why some people face age-related health problems sooner than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This knowledge opens the door to personalized medicine, allowing us to create tailored interventions that could boost prevention efforts and enhance our quality of life as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these findings, paying special attention to our health in our 40s and 60s becomes even more critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple measures like increasing physical activity to protect heart health and maintain muscle mass, or reducing alcohol consumption, could go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/monthly-aging-treatment-helps-you-live-long-die-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;delaying the ‘break down’ process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big believer that we should try to adjust our lifestyles while we’re still healthy,” Snyder aptly concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:26:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQZEUxdHBzNS1NN3NjZVJPQTBUcXhhYklQVURZbW80UnpTUENGdzhpOFFVQ2hibkdVYVhxVndERzEzcnJJT2pBSWFLWGVMVHMzdHBwLWdYNl9FVkJnbGEwbzJoRmtjOC1GTl96Yk5TRHB6VjdWSWdRa2twMnEyMFM1X3VDeUd4OHFKQmc</guid></item><item><title>Take your fitness to the next level with the 7-Minute Power Workout - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNNnA0dGxNZXZGN3V3WDg2WjlTcllHMU9kdWJReGhDTzg3X2dSRHBsbkExMFN1MmlkWXRBYzMyaF8zSGYzZm1BcnMtV1A2OWtNSDVJWVI3Y3U4WExtUXVuY2dELTMzRnEwMTA2MVBVcjU5c2QtSzVfRmh1UlVwaHJNUFZiQnd0Snh1MzdrdG9SS181cG1pZDJZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;p id="GEZCQLHENFABJD2FR3UFSORUOQ" data-contentid="GEZCQLHENFABJD2FR3UFSORUOQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;The more you exercise, the easier it gets.

But, even more important, it can “contribute toward the delayed onset of age-related disease,” according to a comprehensive 2018 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5983157/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of how regular exercise benefits our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" data-contentid="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;To help increase your fitness, Jordan developed the 7-Minute Power Workout for The Washington Post. It builds on the scientific principles he used in the original 7-minute workout — featuring 12 movements that increase strength, power and endurance. The exercises focus alternately on the upper and lower body and are meant to be completed at a relatively high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" data-contentid="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;That means your effort should feel like an eight on a scale from zero to 10, Jordan said. Or, more informally, you should be able to speak a few words before pausing for breath, he said, but you shouldn’t be able to sing during the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" data-contentid="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Since the exercises in the new workout are more complex than before, involving a greater range of muscles and coordination, it’s fine to start deliberately and dial in the proper form, Jordan said. Then gradually speed up until you’re pushing yourself during each move for the full seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" data-contentid="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;As always, consider talking with your doctor before trying a new exercise routine.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FORT BEND COUNTY, Texas — Fort Bend County Health and Human Services on Sunday announced that it has confirmed its first case of the measles in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county said the case is in a woman between the ages of 50 and 60. They said the case is associated with international travel and is not connected to the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-texas-outbreak-march-25-update/285-a1c5e8c8-37fd-4dbb-975f-4e3af739b9b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your safety and well-being remain my top priority," said Fort Bend County Judge KP George. "I urge all residents to check their immunization records, get vaccinated if necessary and stay vigilant for symptoms. Together, we can protect our families, neighbors and the greater Fort Bend community."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBCHHS is investigating the case and working to identify any potential exposures to limit the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is through vaccination," Fort Bend County Local Health Authority Dr. Gale-Lowe said. "The MMR vaccine is safe, effective and provides strong protection against measles."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBCHHS listed the following measles symptoms to be on the lookout for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (101 degrees or higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash, typically starting on the face and spreading downward two to five days after initial symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Koplik spots (bluish-white specks or a red-rose background appearing on the buccal and labial mucosa usually opposite the molars)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health authority said people with the measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears to four days after.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe you've been exposed to the measles or are experiencing measles symptoms, FBCHHS says to isolate yourself to prevent the spread and to contact your healthcare provider via phone before getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;

        Samples taken by a Swedish team of researchers show how daily coffee drinkers may be at risk of higher cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease.

A new study by Swedish researchers has found that high levels of cholesterol-elevating substances were present in most coffee machines in workplaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two substances in question are cafestol and kahweol, both found in coffee beans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Uppsala University, in collaboration with the Chalmers University of Technology, took samples from fourteen coffee machines in break rooms at different workplaces using five different coffee brands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentrations varied depending on the machine and the time, according to the findings published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nmcd-journal.com/article/S0939-4753(25)00087-0/fulltext"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism &amp;amp; Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewing machines - the most common type of coffee machine in the workplaces studied - and boiled coffee in a pot showed the highest concentration of cholesterol-elevating substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From this, we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee," David Iggman, a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden and the study’s lead author, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, not all coffee machines manage to filter them out. But the problem varies between different types of coffee machines, and the concentrations also showed large variations over time," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL - or low-density lipoprotein - cholesterol is often referred to as the "bad" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Filtered coffee 'is preferable'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it’s clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters was found to almost completely filter out the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine the precise effects on cholesterol levels among consumers, according to Iggman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally present in the body, cholesterol can become a problem if there’s too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can build up in plaque in the walls of arteries making them arteries hard and narrow, according to the US-based Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot that may cause a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_2" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="2" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe is the region with the highest prevalence of cholesterol in the world, with over 50 per cent of adults estimated to be living with higher than average levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Statista data from 2021, Lithuania had one of the highest average cholesterol levels in Europe, whereas Greece was among the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:13:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQUmlBckJVTnUxNTJLWE1aWUl3b0Jndl9nOG1kZEpDWkwzZi04X0M3MlFfYTdjaVZRdUkwcTRPYU82aG1WdFMwWkJPWFNNSUpFUFc0OVFkSEJsN2hVYVhpdDB1UUJJb2IwNHh2OEVkT3g3RW1JRmFSQm9iWVZsd1ZmVEtTeVZhSFVoOE1fdFNEWF9kdXlfQ1pCVDJOWU5CUDgxR1FlbmNtVUV2UWdkNFUxUlU4MC0xVDBzdkNxUGF0YTRHNU1FZXZHWXV3</guid></item><item><title>World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOZ2dtT1lVU054U0dZUjJLbnJReVdHc2J6cU53VmFWV09MdW5DMVpaN3F0aEkxX3hPSEhYeU5ZUmNLOWNFZjBlNGE4NGx1OUxLam8wQ2xUejIxU3BRMW1nMUdmZXRGRFppYXdpYUlHNFdzZG9xY0pFd2pyNFktZTNfMHRTUEdlTzNxbzVMc2JUcExhWXVJcnpGVXkxc2lYMEUxdk1Kdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;One of the most consumed drugs in the US – and the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00316"&gt;most commonly taken analgesic worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;– may do a lot more than simply take the edge off your headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;span&gt;cetaminophen, also known as paracetamol and sold widely under the brand names Tylenol and Panadol, may also increase risk-taking, according to a study from 2020 that measured changes in people's behavior when under the influence of the common over-the-counter medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don't feel as scared,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;neuroscientist Baldwin Way from The Ohio State University when the findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With nearly 25 percent of the population in the US taking acetaminophen each week, reduced risk perceptions and increased risk-taking could have important effects on society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that acetaminophen's effects on pain reduction also extend to various psychological processes, lowering people's&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610374741"&gt;receptivity to hurt feelings&lt;/a&gt;, experiencing&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/9/1345/2224135"&gt;reduced empathy&lt;/a&gt;, and even&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tylenol-may-make-it-harder-for-users-to-spot-errors-says-study"&gt;blunting cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147551 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-545x415.jpg 545w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-600x457.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A 3D molecule of acetaminophen. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paracetamol-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png"&gt;Ben Mills/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;span&gt;n a similar way, the research suggests people's affective ability to perceive and evaluate risks may potentially be altered or impaired when they take acetaminophen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the effects might be slight – and should be considered hypothetical for now – they're worth noting, given acetaminophen is the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://liverfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Common-Medicines-with-Acetaminophen-Know-Your-Dose.pdf"&gt;most common drug ingredient in America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found in over 600 different kinds of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments involving over 500 university students as participants, Way and his team measured how a single 1,000 mg dose of acetaminophen (the recommended maximum adult single dosage) randomly assigned to participants affected their risk-taking behavior, compared against placebos randomly given to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of the experiments, participants had to pump up an un-inflated balloon on a computer screen, with each single pump earning imaginary money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their instructions were to earn as much imaginary money as possible by pumping the balloon as much as possible, but to make sure not to pop the balloon, in which case they would lose the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the students who took acetaminophen engaged in significantly more risk-taking during the exercise, relative to the more cautious and conservative  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; group. On the whole, those on acetaminophen pumped (and burst) their balloons more than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147552 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-303x415.jpg 303w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-600x821.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Baldwin Way, who led the research. (&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Ohio State News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don't want the balloon to burst and lose your money,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the balloon simulation, participants also filled out surveys during two of the experiments, rating the level of risk they perceived in various hypothetical scenarios, such as betting a day's income on a sporting event, bungee jumping off a tall bridge, or driving a car without a seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the surveys, acetaminophen consumption did appear to reduce perceived risk compared to the control group, although in another similar survey, the same effect wasn't observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While an experiment like this doesn't necessarily reflect how acetaminophen might affect people in real-life scenarios, based on an average of results across the various tests, the team concluded that there is a significant relationship between taking acetaminophen and choosing more risk, even if the observed effect appears slight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the researchers acknowledged the drug's apparent effects on risk-taking behavior could also be interpreted via other kinds of psychological processes, such as reduced anxiety, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It may be that as the balloon increases in size, those on placebo feel increasing amounts of anxiety about a potential burst,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsaa108/5897711"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When the anxiety becomes too much, they end the trial. Acetaminophen may reduce this anxiety, thus leading to greater risk taking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring such psychological alternative explanations for this phenomenon – as well as investigating the biological mechanisms responsible for acetaminophen's effects on people's choices in situations like this – should be addressed in future research, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential impact of acetaminophen's effect on people's risk perception, the drug nonetheless remains one of the most important and highly used medications in the world, considered an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines"&gt;essential medicine by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, even if other questions linger&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We really need more research on the effects of acetaminophen and other over-the-counter drugs on the choices and risks we take," &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsaa108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But instead of taking it for granted, we asked nutritionists: Are apples good for you? Plus, we looked at what the research says about eating the fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephani-johnson-dcn-rdn-88856120/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., is an adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition sciences at &lt;a href="https://shp.rutgers.edu/?_gl=1%2Ai4adtj%2A_gcl_au%2AMTUyNTkyNDg3Mi4xNzQwNTA4MTQ2&amp;amp;_ga=2.151383929.1366124760.1742845226-227429285.1738870850" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers University School of Health Professions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers University School of Health Professions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelyn-arteche-rdn-a6854611/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Evelyn Arteche;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Evelyn Arteche&lt;/a&gt;, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I. is at &lt;a href="https://www.cooperhealth.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cooper University Health Care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cooper University Health Care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it bad to eat an apple every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, no. “While apples contain fructose, a natural sugar in all fruits, they are a valuable part of a healthy diet,” says Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions. “Their nutrient density and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a33382312/fiber-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; content contribute to overall health, making them a beneficial choice for daily consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more specific, medium apples typically have about 4.4 grams of fiber, which can help you to meet the daily recommended fiber intake of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Apples also count as one of your five servings of fruits and vegetables, which should be a daily goal, says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they do contain sugar, to minimize blood sugar spikes, control the portion size of apples and pair them with protein and healthy fats, such as nut butter, cheese, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the nutritional value of apples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the breakdown for &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750341/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium apple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one medium apple&lt;/a&gt; with skin, which is about three inches in diameter (roughly the size of a baseball or a small fist):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health benefits of apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, Johnson and Evelyn Arteche, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I., at Cooper University Health Care, break down some of the reasons to consider eating apples regularly. “It is important to note that you get more nutrition value from eating a whole apple with the skin,” Arteche says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoother digestion: &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber in apples can help promote bowel regularity. “Additionally, the pectin in apple skin serves as a prebiotic, supporting a healthy microbiome and overall gut health,” says Johnson. “Research indicates that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in various aspects of health, including mental well-being, disease risk, and immune function.” Studies explicitly examining the effects of apples on gut health are limited, but extensive research supports the beneficial impacts of fiber and pectin on gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;“Apples can aid in weight management, particularly when consumed in place of higher-calorie, less healthy options,” says Johnson. Research specifically evaluating the effects of apple consumption on weight management in humans is limited. But, Johnson points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one 2015 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; which found that higher fruit and vegetable intake, as well as increased intake of apples and pears, was inversely associated with weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-fiber foods with high water content, such as apples, promote satiety so you feel fuller longer than if you, say, ate a cookie. “Fiber slows down gastric emptying and induces a feeling of fullness lasting longer when compared to drinking juice, for example, which does not contain much fiber,” says Arteche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have yielded mixed results specifically regarding apple consumption and heart health. “Despite these mixed findings, substantial research links diets rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, as seen in those following the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;,” says Johnson. “Increasing fruit and vegetable intake, including apples, may contribute to cardiovascular health by supporting gut microbiome balance, promoting weight management, and providing antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals implicated in cardiovascular disease risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential side effects of eating apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diarrhea:&lt;/strong&gt; “Fiber in excess can cause diarrhea in some people,” says Arteche. “For example, people with conditions such as Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, gastroparesis, ulcerative colitis, a new colostomy, or a new ileostomy may need to avoid apples, especially apples with skin on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food allergies:&lt;/strong&gt; “People who are allergic to apricot, plum, almond, peach, pear, and strawberry can also be allergic to apples and should avoid them,” says Arteche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar elevation:&lt;/strong&gt; “Although apples are a healthy, low-calorie food, they are naturally high in sugar, which may contribute to blood sugar elevations, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes,” says Johnson. “However, in comparison to other fruits, apples have a lower glycemic index, meaning that they do not spike blood sugar to the same extent as some other carbohydrate foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples generally are safe to eat daily unless you have a food allergy, or other medical reason to avoid them.

provide sustained energy, according to studies," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a larger meal at night can be more difficult to digest, increase the likelihood of acid reflux and disrupted sleep due to slower metabolism during the evening, Routhenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating a large meal before bedtime can cause acid reflux and disrupt sleep, a dietitian told Fox News Digital.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The

registered dietitian, founder of the NY Nutrition Group and author of "The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan," isn't entirely on "team big breakfast" or bust, but she does see the merits of consuming a

have an appetite and the time for a larger breakfast, you may notice fewer cravings and urges to eat at night, more stable energy levels throughout the day and better concentration, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moskovitz stressed, however, that there is no one-size-fits-all methodology for meal planning and portion distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way to plan out meals is to sit down and figure out your specific needs, lifestyle and what's realistic," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you want to ingest some kind of nourishment every three to four hours throughout the day — starting with the first hour you wake up and aiming to give yourself at least two to three hours of digestive rest before bedtime, Moskovitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating a big breakfast could lead to more stable energy levels throughout the day and better concentration, according to a dietitian.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, people report feeling more energy, fewer cravings and reasonable calorie intake when they make time for a balanced, protein- and fiber-rich breakfast," she said, further making the case for a filling breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moskovitz shared a day-in-the-life example of front-loading your diet by eating a larger breakfast, followed by smaller meals for lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose from any of the following options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 eggs + 2 slices of sprouted grain bread + ½ avocado + 1 cup of fresh fruit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup of 2% Greek yogurt + 1 banana + ½ cup of high-protein granola + ¼ cup of nuts/seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grain tortilla + lox + ½ avocado + sliced cucumber, tomato and red

inspiration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One breakfast option that's rarely discussed, said Moskovitz, is eating &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/dinner" rel="nofollow

and sufficient energy throughout the day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein's sample meal plan, adhering to this bigger breakfast principle, makes use of a robust, savory breakfast, followed by a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/lunch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lighter lunch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"

class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00385-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that adults who report high levels of autistic traits through online surveys may not reflect the same social behaviors or clinical profiles as those who have been formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Although these two groups may appear similar on paper, the study found meaningful differences in their social interactions, mental health symptoms, and the way they perceive and influence others during social tasks. The findings raise questions about the widespread reliance on self-report surveys in online autism research and suggest that diagnostic evaluations by trained professionals remain essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by a team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were motivated by a growing trend in psychiatric research: the shift toward large-scale, web-based studies. Online platforms like Prolific allow researchers to gather data from thousands of people quickly and inexpensively. While this approach has clear advantages in terms of scale and accessibility, it often relies solely on participants’ own descriptions of their traits and mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By allowing people to participate in research remotely and anonymously, online studies ease many of the burdens associated with in-person involvement and allow researchers to recruit large samples quickly. However, as online studies become increasingly popular in psychiatric research, it is essential to evaluate their limitations,” said study authors Sarah M. Banker, who is now a postdoctoral fellow NYU Langone, and Xiaosi Gu, an associate professor and director of the Center for Computational Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably, anonymous online research typically relies on self-report to measure symptoms and identify participants with specific psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Without the added context of clinical evaluation, self-reported symptoms may be limited in their ability to capture the experiences and diagnoses of people who have difficulties describing their emotions and struggles – including many autistic individuals. Our study sought to evaluate whether autistic participants identified through online self-reported symptoms show similar profiles to those identified through in-person clinical evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared three groups of adults. One group included 56 individuals who were diagnosed with autism after undergoing in-person clinical evaluations. The second group consisted of 56 people recruited online who reported high levels of autistic traits using a standard survey. A third group, also recruited online, reported low levels of autistic traits and served as a comparison. All participants were matched in age and gender to allow for fair comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a mix of questionnaires and interactive tasks. All participants completed the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire, which measures characteristics often associated with autism, including social difficulties and rigid behavior. The in-person group also underwent clinical interviews and standardized assessments conducted by trained professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all three groups participated in two computer-based tasks designed to simulate social interactions. One task measured the participant’s ability to influence the behavior of virtual characters to gain rewards, while the other tracked their social decision-making over time, such as whether they acted warmly or distantly toward new characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that although the high-trait online group and the in-person autism group reported similar levels of autistic traits, their profiles differed in key ways. The online group with high autistic traits reported more symptoms of social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder than the clinically diagnosed group. In fact, their psychiatric profiles resembled those of people who are socially anxious but not necessarily autistic. This suggests that some people who score high on autism trait questionnaires in the general population may actually be describing a different type of social struggle—one rooted more in anxiety than in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings came from the comparison between self-report and clinical assessment. Among participants with a confirmed autism diagnosis, there was no meaningful relationship between how they rated their own symptoms and how clinicians rated them. This held true for both core domains of autism: repetitive behaviors and social communication. The two types of measures seemed to capture different aspects of the condition—one reflecting internal experience and the other focusing on observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that, for adults with a confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (and without co-occurring intellectual disability), higher clinician-rated symptoms did not correspond to higher self-reported symptoms,” Banker and Gu told PsyPost. “This finding suggests that the two measures capture different aspects of autism: while self-reported assessments may capture internal experiences, clinician-rated assessments may capture external presentations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences also emerged in how participants behaved during the social interaction tasks. In the first task, which tested whether participants could influence virtual characters by accepting or rejecting monetary offers, the in-person autism group showed reduced ability to recognize and use social influence. They rejected fewer high offers and did not adjust their behavior in ways that would have led to better future outcomes. They also reported less awareness of their ability to influence the game, suggesting a diminished perception of social controllability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, both the high-trait and low-trait online groups performed similarly on this task and showed more awareness of their influence. This points to a key distinction: while individuals in both online groups may share internal feelings of social difficulty, their external behavior in social contexts does not mirror the social differences seen in people with a clinical autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second task, which involved choosing how to interact with different characters during a simulated narrative, the in-person autism group again showed unique patterns. They were less likely to choose friendly or affiliative responses, even when their self-reported feelings toward the characters were similar to those of the online high-trait group. This gap between internal attitude and external behavior was specific to the clinically diagnosed group, suggesting that their social behavior was more affected by their condition than by their feelings or intentions alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite similarly high levels of self-reported autistic traits, adults recruited online (without self-identification of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis) and those recruited in-person (with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis confirmed through clinical evaluation) displayed different psychiatric profiles and tendencies during simulated social interactions, suggesting they may represent different groups,” Banker and Gu explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that, without additional information (such as diagnostic information collected by trained professionals), self-reported symptom surveys may not be sufficient to identify or draw representative conclusions about certain diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder. This work emphasizes the important distinction between diagnoses and traits and provides a caution against the potential for generating assumptions about one group based on the findings from research conducted in another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters not just for research, but also for clinical care. If online studies are used to shape understanding of autism or to develop interventions, it is important that the participants truly reflect the population the research aims to help. Otherwise, there is a risk of creating treatments or policies that are not effective—or even relevant—for those who are clinically diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is also interesting when considering the emerging use of online mental health platforms, where clinician evaluation is not always available and symptom severity (and improvement) only relies solely on self-report,” the researchers noted. “Our finding suggests that such approach might need to be revisited and compared against human clinician evaluations/ratings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers were also careful to note that self-reports still have an important role to play. They are valuable tools for understanding how individuals experience their own challenges. In fact, self-reports can offer insights that clinicians might miss, particularly when it comes to internal states like anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although our findings highlight discrepancies between self-reported and clinician-rated symptoms, they do not diminish the value of self-report surveys in autism research,” Banker and Gu said. “In fact, self-reports are crucial for understanding individuals’ own experiences, internal distress, and overall wellbeing. They also empower individuals with lived experience to shape narratives about their condition and help to challenge inaccurate assumptions about the reasons behind autistic behaviors. Rather than discounting personal perspectives, our results emphasize caution for researchers in relying solely on self-reported symptom measures when defining or generalizing about diagnostic groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00385-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phenotypic divergence between individuals with self-reported autistic traits and clinically ascertained autism&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sarah M.

The collection had accrued over the course of several years, picked up – and then swiftly dropped. Health sprees that &lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/century-of-fad-diets-history-weight-loss-trends-b2689369.html"&gt;only had a hefty bill&lt;/a&gt; from Holland &amp;amp; Barrett to show for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of us are susceptible to the idea that&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/collagen-food-diet-supplements-b2717960.html"&gt; “investing” in our health&lt;/a&gt; equates to spending hard-earned cash to prove to ourselves that we’re serious. The unworn trainers or expensive yoga pants, the unused gym membership (a cliché because it’s true) – and, for others like me, a huge box of very good intentions, rattling around the drawer under the bathroom sink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I clear out everything best before 2022 (or, in some cases, 2019)? Yes. Did I also reignite the urge to buy more? Naturally. Like most people, I’d also been recently caught in the TikTok wellness trap, where everyone appears to have the answers, no matter what their credentials. Powdered greens – a dietary supplement of vegetables, fruits and algae which claims to be a concentrated dose of nutrients – appeared to be a brilliantly easy panacea, as did &lt;a href="/topic/supplements"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; I’d never previously taken notice of – milk thistle, to cleanse a tired liver for a tenner, or ashwagandha to lower blood pressure and anxiety, and collagen for pretty much everything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need pointing out that the platform has very little merit in the health world, yet sales of beauty and wellness products such as supplements are through the roof on ever-influential TikTok Shop – and this is big business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the supplements industry, health really is wealth. Over the last 15 years, the over-the-counter &lt;a href="/topic/vitamins"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals market has grown exponentially, generating more than £650m in UK sales last year. In the US, it’s far higher, with one of the more conservative estimates suggesting Americans will be swallowing $70bn of supplements by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, unsurprising. Five years ago, we lived through an unprecedented global health crisis that, when life was boiled down to the bare basics, gave us all a thorough wake-up call. Covid led us all to reconsider our perceptions of health, the way we live and, crucially, how we prevent ourselves from getting ill. Naturally, many people turned to quick-fix supplements – and sales were their highest in more than a decade; almost twice the amount sold nationally last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is what the supplement sector thrives on – but as to whether they work, it’s a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One size does not fit all &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should think about taking supplements like a prescription,” says registered nutritional therapist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gqjordannutrition"&gt;GQ Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the time, we’re conditioned to think that taking supplements, whatever they are, must be safeguarding or improving our health. We forget that health – existing or genetically predisposed conditions, our levels of fitness and diet – is not an equal starting point for all of us. Additionally, some over-the-counter vitamins and minerals can interact with medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another; everyone has their own signs and symptoms of what they might be lacking, probably the first thing to do is to track those to see if there’s any consistency. So, if you’re waking up in the night consistently or having an energy dip in the afternoon, it might be a good sign to consider taking some magnesium or vitamin D to see if they help,” advises Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 iTcyPS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177518"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If at all possible, Jordan says, speak to your GP about your own health status before deciding what you need supplementing, and before sinking a load of cash into your local pharmacy. Or, if that’s not possible and you can afford to, put that money towards seeing a nutritionist. Getting goodness through diet is more sustainable in the long run because of how things are broken down in our gut. Some supplements aren’t suitable for people with underlying health concerns, especially when it comes to the liver, which must process everything you put in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that your requirements will change depending on your current situation. As we age, our hormones change drastically, which can change what we need and how much of it is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all supplements are made equal &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from it. Supplements, says Lynsey Vaughan, nutritionist and product innovation lead at wellness brand &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.highernature.com%252Fpages%252Four-story%253F_gl%253D1%252A6w73fg%252A_up%252AMQ..%252A_gs%252AMQ..%2526gclid%253DCj0KCQjwkZm_BhDrARIsAAEbX1EmG8buaB6PRaZzLVF2Wm9Rieu9dTWLYwJ4J9Ys3BCibB2hnVF79IoaApkFEALw_wcB%2526gbraid%253D0AAAAAD_kRq7f59ux-F7N4wZkZOUZIbnBQ%26sref%3D%2Fhealth-and-wellbeing%2Fsupplements-gut-health-wellness-b2723535.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fhealth-and-wellbeing%2Fsupplements-gut-health-wellness-b2723535.html&amp;amp;article_id=2723535&amp;amp;author=Zo%C3%AB+Beaty&amp;amp;tag=supplements%2Cgut+health%2CVitamins%2Cwellbeing&amp;amp;section=N%2FA&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-03-30T12%3A05%3A34.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=feature-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;Higher Nature, &lt;/a&gt;which is “committed to unmasking the world of supplements”. “There are a few things to keep in mind,” Vaughan explains, particularly whether the capsule or tablet is made of natural ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A non-active ingredient might be the physical shell that you put the ingredients into, and then there are also excipients, which is an industry term for non-active ingredients. Not all supplements have them in – and many don’t have the right amount in. For a good supplement, you want the actual ingredient, limited non-active and synthetic ingredients, and to get the right dose. There are many that I come across where I’ll look at the formula and think, ‘What is that even doing?’ Often there’s no real benefit at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 jDSKHB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="You can’t out-supplement a bad diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177519"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;You can’t out-supplement a bad diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in ultra-processed foods, look at how many ingredients are listed. Too many non-active or synthetic ingredients make it much harder for the body to digest and, adds Jordan, can cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “You could think that you’re safeguarding your health or being proactive, which comes from a really good place, but then choose supplements that might not be right for you on a personal level or up to scratch. That could have a real impact on other aspects of your health, particularly your &lt;a href="/topic/gut-health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, because the supplements contain all these buffers and preservatives that aren’t really essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut lining is super-sensitive. It’s the barrier between our outside world and our body, essentially, and these things can have a compounding irritating effect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the label, look out for “synthetics versus natural food form”, recommends Vaughan. “Most people assume that vitamins and minerals are natural. In fact, one survey found that 70 per cent of people think that vitamins and minerals in fortified foods are natural, but they’re not – they’re synthetic. Similarly in the supplement world, there’s a huge knowledge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can’t ‘out supplement’ a bad diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m allergic to the wellness industry wheel,” Jordan jokes. “Most of the ads we all see online – things like green powders, for example – should be under investigation, in my opinion. Many of them create pain points for people and then target them for vulnerability: weight loss, infertility … Solve your PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] with an expensive green powder. It’s really dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177520"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it can mean that we end up feeling more comfortable paying less attention to what we’re actually eating. “Nothing can supplement a bad lifestyle,” Jordan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan agrees. “Based on dietary data, around 75 per cent of people in the UK are not eating enough oily fish,” she says. Generally, our diets have changed exponentially in the last few decades – and Vaughan knows the impact from her own health struggles with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. “I forced myself to eat liver, which is full of nutrients, when I went through my own health struggles,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, especially in poorer communities, we used to eat much more offal and cheap oily fish such as kippers. It goes without saying that we should also be focusing on eating lots of rich, leafy greens and moving our bodies enough, which all helps with our gut health and would alleviate the need for so many supplements in the first place. That baseline, both Vaughan and Jordan agree, must be heeded before we start trying to compensate over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you take just one supplement, this should be it &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a close call here: for Jordan, vitamin D, omega 3 and magnesium all chart high; for Vaughan, omega 3 just about tips it with vitamin D a close second. In fact, the government recommends we should all take a supplement for vitamin D, as thanks to the lack of sunlight in the UK, which stimulates the production of it in our bodies naturally, most of us are deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in winter and autumn months,” says Jordan. “Just having that can really help your energy, help your mood, help your gut as well, and your immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 hItpXp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177521"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even when we are eating enough oily fish, which is packed with omega 3, Vaughan notes that recent years have seen fluctuations in the amount of nutrients we’re getting from fish like salmon and mackerel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s some evidence that omega 3 levels in oily fish have been declining over the last 50 years,” she explains. So there’s a combination of, not only are we not eating enough, but the amount that you used to have to eat to get enough omega 3 is now no longer enough either, so it exacerbates it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega 3s are so important for us at the cellular level – every single cell membrane needs omega 3s to kind of work their membranes to work flexibly, to let nutrients in, let waste out. They’re also good for hormone balance, brain function. It’s incredibly necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan agrees, adding that it’s especially important in pregnancy and postpartum. “A particular DHA, a specific type of omega 3, is given to the baby, not mum in that time. So women who have experienced brain fog after giving birth, for example, might benefit from supplementing with omega 3 to get those levels back up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTGhJd2h1Vjl0bDhubWRhMjl5QmUtdmc2bzBYdm1mOFA0OEpOdVAwMjlENVF0WTRNN0MzcG0tb0t3TkJiUFpDMFFtaEZrM0FqcDV1aDRfY0JMakxsUWplSjFaNGRtZVBWZUhFU2NON1hMY25KOUZsN3otVWwwX280WDFDbjJ5MVZRYnBJS25xWVp2MVBDa0VNZk50MnA</guid></item><item><title>In research-rich San Diego, Trump cuts hit studies of HIV, domestic violence and more - The San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNSy1PWW5NbllUWlFnclhUOTd0MC1vTklXRlhsSkpYQ1dqcUt2djBDdDRRcGtJTVBrVEQ4ZE5jZmlaNTh6VFJxT29oZHVjb25JUnAxUWs0OVc5YUxBU0RPdjlPaUx2OHdpV0NRN1d5ejlwNmRMYjlGMXVpaGozX3pEcDdOX1JVaVFNdDdzOUpOM2lLNUFQLTd0TzdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is pulling funding to San Diego researchers exploring issues from HIV prevention to violence against pregnant women, and local scientists warn the impacts will extend far beyond simply ending current projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the cuts will cost students future jobs and training opportunities, stunting the country’s pipeline of future scientists, and that the administration’s targeting of diversity programs and research will make the scientific workforce less diverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists say they even feel pressured to censor or distort known scientific facts in their grant applications, for fear of being denied funding because the applications relate to topics the Trump administration has sought to defund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has said the federal government “spends too much money on programs, contracts, and grants that do not promote the interests of the American people,” as he wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/radical-transparency-about-wasteful-spending/"&gt;Feb. 18 memo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health, where many of the research cuts are concentrated, did not answer questions about what kinds of grants the NIH is cutting and why or about scientists’ concerns about the impacts of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But funding termination letters from the agency indicate it is cutting projects it believes deal with topics such as diversity, equity and gender that agency leaders consider unscientific and unrelated to Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Diego Union-Tribune interviewed several local researchers who recently learned their grant funding was cut, or who are anticipating cuts based on the topics they research or the programs from which they derive funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major cut hit UC San Diego on Thursday when the Trump administration ordered Dr. Davey Smith, director of infectious diseases, to pause or limit work on 16 clinical trials focused on HIV/AIDS, including long-term efforts to develop a vaccine against HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said that work collectively represents about $2.5 million in annual NIH funding, and the disruption includes one genomic program that’s involved hundreds of participants dating back more than 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, at least three other NIH-funded projects at local universities have been terminated, &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf"&gt;according to a list&lt;/a&gt; published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include a study at UC San Diego investigating effects of testosterone replacement therapy for transgender men, one at San Diego State investigating mental health impacts from sexual minority stigma and another study at UCSD into how intersectional stigma toward Latino men who have sex with men affects their use of HIV testing and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘A difficult day’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 21 brought bad news and worse news for Keith Horvath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH axed funding for a three-year study about HIV prevention that the San Diego State psychology professor was co-leading with UC San Diego professor of medicine Susan Little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to investigate how to get more people at risk of contracting HIV to take pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a highly effective HIV preventive drug regimen. They developed a mobile app that provides patients with information about PrEP, and their study is investigating whether trial participants who used it were more likely to take and follow through with PrEP than participants who didn’t have the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with just three months left in the study, now Horvath and Little have lost their funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that weren’t enough, Horvath also learned that same Friday that a decades-old national research network he is involved in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/25/nih-cuts-include-hiv-aids-prevention-program-for-adolescents/"&gt;also was axed&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV Interventions, which began in 2001, is the only research network in the U.S. that focuses on HIV among young people ages 13 to 24, Horvath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sadly, that really ended 24 years of scientific progress for young people in terms of HIV,” he said. “As you can imagine, Friday was a difficult day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These losses are just two of several federal grants focused on HIV research and prevention that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/health/cdc-hiv-prevention-treatment.html"&gt;has recently targeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of Horvath and Little’s funding will not only hurt the researchers conducting the study, they say, but also the 116 patients participating in their clinical trial. Some patients are still in the middle of completing their PrEP regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are individuals who are seeking the best health care and the best opportunities they can get, and they viewed this study as one way of fulfilling that,” Little said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not all of the participants finish the trial, it will compromise the study’s nearly three years of work and what can be learned from it, Horvath said. Horvath and Little are looking for alternative private funding and considering writing an appeal letter to the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their award was terminated because the NIH decided that their project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” the NIH told them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” an NIH official wrote in the termination letter. “Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horvath and Little’s study is not about gender identity. Horvath speculates that their funding was flagged for termination because men who have sex with men, as well as transgender women, are highly impacted and at risk for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we were following the science of who is at highest risk of HIV, it seems to be that’s why it was defunded,” Horvath said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added, “Our decision to enroll members of those communities isn’t based on a political agenda at all. It’s based off of sound scientific evidence of which Americans are at highest need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘It’s not the first time’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian Cazares is becoming a neuroscientist so he can help people like him become scientists, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated from Mexico as a youth and is a product of U.S. public education, Cazares is now a neuroscience postdoctoral researcher at UCSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to be a research professor to not only do cool science, but to help diversify the workforce by providing mentorship that is a lot more relatable to people of low-income means or Latinos,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work focuses on studying brain activity in children with autism spectrum disorder and investigating whether anything gets missed when scientists use animals, such as mice, to model such brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9260903" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-research-grants-001.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Christian Cazares poses for a photo at UC San Diego on Wednesday, March 26, 2025 in San Diego.

(Meg McLaughlin / The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazares’ postdoctoral career is funded by a NIH fellowship called &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250201161136/https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/training/nih-blueprint-and-brain-initiative-d-span-award-f99k00"&gt;D-SPAN&lt;/a&gt;, which has provided up to six years of funding for promising neuroscience graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds nationwide. The fellowship has helped develop more than 200 neuroscientists since 2017, according to the NIH, many of them women and people of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has targeted federal programs like D-SPAN that are &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/"&gt;focused on diversity&lt;/a&gt; and equity because he says such programs discriminate based on race and sex and contradict American values of individual merit and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazares is in the second year of what is supposed to be a four-year grant through D-SPAN. He said this month he has not yet been told officially whether D-SPAN is canceled or whether his fellowship funding — his salary — will be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since early February, the NIH has changed references to the D-SPAN program on its website from the present tense to the past tense, scrubbed the word “diversity” from the program webpage and the program is no longer accepting applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazares worries that the end of funding for diversity and equity programs will mean fewer low-income people of color will become scientists, and will ultimately set back research efforts to solve problems facing those communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, Cazares has no plans to leave science. He is looking for alternative funding as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s basically a matter of adapting and recognizing it’s not the first time in history that people like us have been excluded from science,” Cazares said. “We just have to do what we can in the meantime and hold the line until we can make a better future for the next generation of scientists, once things hopefully change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘We have to just keep trying’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Brenda Bloodgood talks to students almost daily who say they don’t know why they’re trying to become a scientist right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often don’t know what to tell them, except we have to just keep trying and hope that this turns around,” the UCSD associate professor of neurobiology said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the director of UCSD’s neuroscience graduate student program, Bloodgood said she is now seeing labs losing their funding, which means they are no longer able to pay for the undergraduate or graduate students they employ. As a result, first-year students are struggling to find a lab that is able to take them — a requirement for their training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9260904" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-UCSD-Science-Rally07-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="SAN DIEGO, CA - MARCH 7, 2025: Brenda Bloodgood, an associate professor of neurobiology, speaks to the crowd during the Stand Up for Science Rally, one of several rallies nation wide protesting federal cuts to science, at the UC San Diego campus in San Diego on Friday, March 7, 2025.

(Hayne Palmour IV / For The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, the neuroscience graduate program has decided to shrink its incoming cohort size from 18 students to no more than 12, Bloodgood said. Similar reductions are happening at graduate programs across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodgood is also the co-director of UCSD’s &lt;a href="https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/programs/all-urh-programs/start-neuro/index.html"&gt;STARTneuro&lt;/a&gt;, a NIH-funded program that provided training, mentorship and funding for 10 community college transfer students each year to help them enter neuroscience research. The program’s NIH funding expired this year – and Bloodgood’s team has applied for a renewal — but the program’s future is unclear as federal officials have targeted programs that similarly support underrepresented students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It had been entirely designed to provide training and mentorship opportunities to students that had not had those opportunities,” Bloodgood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of the ongoing cuts go beyond the immediate impact of ending current research, Bloodgood stressed — it also means that universities will train and produce fewer future scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a brain drain problem that will have ripple effects years into the future, Bloodgood said, noting that it takes a decade to train a neuroscientist. Meanwhile, other countries see an opportunity to gain and cultivate research talent; many European officials have said they plan &lt;a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/europe-offers-refuge-to-americas-researchers/4021201.article"&gt;to recruit&lt;/a&gt; fleeing American scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to have a significant contraction of the scientific workforce,” Bloodgood said. “This will be felt in academia for obvious reasons, but this will also be felt in biotech, in pharmaceutical companies — the biomedical industry writ large.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘If I can’t try out things, I can’t tell you how to fix it’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant women and recently pregnant women in the U.S., but relatively little research has been conducted on why that is or how to prevent it, said Rebecca Fielding-Miller, associate professor of public health at UCSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fielding-Miller was part of a team of researchers on a grant project that would have focused on the role of intimate partner violence in mortality for these women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was going to train a dozen early-career scientists and clinicians to conduct their own research on the issue. Each of them would have received a yearlong mentorship and produced a research paper. And the researchers were going to write an open-source curriculum on how to train others to conduct similar research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH axed the project’s $400,000, two-year grant on March 21. The team had not yet recruited any participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9260905" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-ICON-UCSD-Jacobs-Medical-Center-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Inside a maternity room the Rady Women and Infants Pavilion at UCSD Jacobs Medical Center in La Jolla on Monday, July 31, 2023 in San Diego, California.

(Alejandro Tamayo / The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH stated its reasons in its termination letter for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fielding-Miller found the letter insulting — particularly its suggestion that fostering research into deadly violence against pregnant and recently pregnant women would “not enhance health, lengthen life or reduce illness.” She noted that pregnancy is associated with a significantly higher risk of homicide for Black women and younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fielding-Miller said the administration’s decisions to target research based on its mention of terms and issues it opposes — such as women, gender and ethnicity — means public health realities that affect or disproportionately affect various communities will go unexplored and ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t measure a problem, we can’t tell you it exists. If I can’t use the words to describe the problem, I can’t tell you it exists. If I can’t try out things, I can’t tell you how to fix it,” Fielding-Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staff writer Gary Robbins contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The women were a mean of 82.5 years old at the start of the study, and they used a wrist device that tracked their sleep and circadian rhythm patterns over three consecutive days once at the start of the study and again five years later. Patients filled out sleep logs and were given neuropsychological tests during the five-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBTFE5LLTBHQ5C74TB4WB5I64A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, participants’ total sleep time increased by 18.7 minutes during the five-year follow-up period, and sleep efficiency — a score of sleep quality — increased by 0.94 percent on average.

    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever asked yourself why it is, that when the dessert menu arrives, somehow, you always seem to have space? Well, researchers might have the answer. The team at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.mpg.de/24159607/0211-neur-dessert-stomach-emerges-in-the-brain" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the same nerve cells that make us feel full after a meal are also responsible for our sweet cravings afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fabien Naneix, a neuroscientist from the Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen and an expert on how &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-hidden-sugar-in-everyday-foods/"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; affects the brain, explains that in this study they found “a subset of neurons located in a very deep part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which usually signal for us to stop eating after a meal. These were actually driving sugar consumption in mice, even when they were full.” Using brain imaging, they found similar results in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has interesting implications for how we approach the very real issue of sugar overconsumption, which is one of the main drivers of poor health conditions such as obesity, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we choose to eat is controlled by our brain. But not all foods are equally ‘rewarding’ for the brain,” says Dr Naneix. “Knowing that craving sugary foods and hunger levels are not necessarily correlated – and that these same brain circuits are involved in other processes like emotion, mood and motivation – can help us manage our cravings better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five ways to work with your body if you want to dial down that sweet tooth – or satisfy it in a healthier way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Fill up on fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Clark, a dietitian, advises &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/old-fashioned-foods-full-of-cancer-fighting-fibre/"&gt;upping fibre&lt;/a&gt; in the diet to prevent blood sugar spikes, which drive sugar cravings. Recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5390821/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also found that eating prebiotic fibre, found in foods like onions, garlic, asparagus and apples, causes changes in the gut bacteria that directly affect the brain, making you less likely to crave sugary foods. Switch to wholegrain bread, rice and pasta and leave the skins on potatoes for an immediate fibre boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;2. Ensure there’s a good helping of healthy fats and protein in your meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They make you feel more satisfied and less likely to reach for something sweet after a meal. Healthy fats, in the form of full-fat dairy, nuts, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-of-avocados/"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt; and olive oil, and protein in nuts, eggs, fish and beans, are important in determining how satisfied you feel, so try to include them in every meal. For example, at breakfast, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthiest-toast/"&gt;toast with jam&lt;/a&gt; provides little protein and healthy fat and won’t fill you up; choose toast with avocado and scrambled egg instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;3. Go for whole foods to reduce sugary cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such is the addictive nature of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/rob-hobson-family-cooking/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs) that food manufacturers have a term for the precise combination of sugar, salt, and fat levels that maximise the consumer’s desire to keep eating by triggering the brain’s pleasure centres; it’s known as “the bliss point”. Reducing UPFs is, therefore, key to reducing cravings. Focus on simple meals with whole ingredients. If you do buy packaged foods, check the list of ingredients and try to avoid those with additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;4. Pay attention to what you’re eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark is keen to point out that often the desire for sweet food comes from the need to be soothed, particularly when we are stressed, and giving in to this craving can be accompanied by feelings of shame. Try eating mindfully: we often eat a sugary snack because we are not tuned into our body’s hunger signals. So before reaching for that biscuit, ask yourself these questions: How hungry am I on a scale of one to 10? If it’s less than eight, you’re not really hungry. Am I just bored or in need of a break? Perhaps have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/why-british-right-about-drinking-tea-green-or-black/"&gt;a cup of tea&lt;/a&gt; instead. Can I ride this out until the next meal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. If you’re going to have dessert, enjoy it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to eat dessert, Clark advises choosing smaller portions but ramping up the comfort in which you eat them, i.e. don’t stand guiltily by the fridge. Use a plate, sit down and enjoy your snack. You can make more nutritious sweet treats too. Have a square of dark chocolate with a teaspoon of nut butter to satisfy your sweet tooth in a more sustaining way.&lt;br&gt;To put it simply, a holistic approach is the best way to deal with sugar cravings, as Dr Naniex confirms: “There is no magic solution, but maintaining a healthy diet to include better quality foods, plenty of physical activity, and a more balanced, less stressful life is the best way to reduce our reliance on sugary foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Three easy (and healthy) chocolate treats to curb your sweet tooth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Dark fruit and nut chocolate ‘pizza’&lt;/h2&gt;

These include hormonal or metabolic changes, age, medications and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor said she herself experienced hair loss some years back &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:due to a medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;due to a medication&lt;/a&gt; she was taking for an autoimmune disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/5-excellent-protein-sources-arent-meat-nutritionists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Excellent Protein Sources That Aren't Meat, According To Nutritionists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Excellent Protein Sources That Aren't Meat, According To Nutritionists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a hard time putting my hair up in a ponytail. It was really upsetting emotionally," she said on "Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began looking for natural remedies, as opposed to trying anything invasive such as hair transplants, she said. After much research, she began massaging &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/benefits-olive-oil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:olive oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and rosemary oil into her scalp at night to stimulate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Nicole Saphier shared natural remedies for hair thinning on "Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It took some patience, but I began seeing significant regrowth and improvement within one to two months of doing this regimen and I haven’t stopped!" she told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My personal experience has continued to reinforce my belief in the power of integrative care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she also put together a collection of liquid natural herbs including gotu kola, horsetail and biotin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To promote blood flow to the scalp - which helps with hair growth - the doctor said she increased her &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/green-tea-fueling-weight-loss-experts-skinny-truth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:green tea intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;green tea intake&lt;/a&gt; and focused on exercising and hydrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as you are &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating healthy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating healthy&lt;/a&gt; and living healthy, your hair, your skin and your nails will have the nutrients that they need to grow," she said on "Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/hair-growth-could-slow-down-popular-diet-plan-study-reveals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hair Growth Could Slow Down With This Popular Diet Plan, Study Reveals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Growth Could Slow Down With This Popular Diet Plan, Study Reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to consult a medical professional if experiencing any issues, she stressed, so that the healthcare provider can find and address the root cause of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saphier also discussed gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Saphier shared tips for good gut health. "Your entire body's wellness focuses on your gut," she said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gut health is tied to everything," said Dr. Saphier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your entire body’s &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wellness focuses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wellness focuses&lt;/a&gt; on your gut, and we have destroyed our guts with antibiotics and processed foods and all these other things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chef-says-stomach-problems-led-maha-journey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chef Says 'Horrible Stomach Problems' Led Him On Maha Journey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chef Says 'Horrible Stomach Problems' Led Him On Maha Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she really likes a comprehensive approach to gut health. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nourishing the gut;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nourishing the gut&lt;/a&gt; with probiotics, which can be found in foods such as yogurt, kimchi and pickles - anything that’s fermented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But you also have to give yourself prebiotics," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics give the nutrients to the probiotics and those good bacteria in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be found in such things as garlic and blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Saphier, at right, discussed hair loss prevention and gut health issues on "Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend" along with Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I actually take liquid garlic every single morning," Saphier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of liquid garlic vs. capsules, the doctor said that in liquid form, garlic is more bioavailable, meaning the body can absorb and use its benefits more efficiently than with capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of diet is fiber. Among the best foods for fiber are raspberries, lentils and avocado, said Saphier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, she said she promotes gut motility (the coordinated muscular contractions that move food and waste through the gastrointestinal tract) with ginger, plus staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/fitness-and-wellbeing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:and exercising;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;and exercising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do all of that and your gut is going to be as healthy as can be," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the impact of stress on hair loss and gut health?

This phantom noise often takes a toll on sleep, focus, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/mental-health-in-the-workplace-navigating-challenges-and-promoting-well-being/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, increasing feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause lies in disrupted nerve activity, usually after damage to the ear or head. But other factors—like background noise, attention levels, memory, and mood—can shape how severe it feels. Despite years of study, no cure has emerged, though the search continues with growing urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the challenge stems from &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-study-reveals-hidden-hearing-modes-within-the-human-ear/"&gt;tinnitus’s strange nature&lt;/a&gt;. People hear what isn’t there—buzzing, ringing, or hissing. Because it doesn’t stem from a single injury or illness, treatments have mostly tried to ease symptoms, not eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional therapies focus on reshaping how the brain responds to the phantom sound. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT) helps people cope with distress, while sound therapies try to mask or soften the perception. Results have been mixed, and relief varies from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Associate Professor Grant Searchfield says this is a treatment made possible by recent technology developments.

Here, tools like Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) or acoustic stimulation attempt to retrain the brain. They work to reduce the sound's emotional impact or help the brain filter it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="transforming_treatment_with_digital_therapeutics"&gt;Transforming Treatment with Digital Therapeutics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent study at the &lt;a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; compared TRT with a partial version of the therapy and standard care. Researchers tracked 151 patients for 18 months. In the full TRT group, 47.1% showed clear improvement in quality of life, versus 40.5% who received standard care. While promising, these gains were modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other trials have looked to technology for answers. The ACR T30 Neurostimulator used targeted sound bursts to disrupt brain patterns. Yet the results showed little difference from placebo. A separate study that paired sound therapy with tongue stimulation also produced only slight improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Grant Searchfield, who led the study, explained, "This therapy de-emphasizes tinnitus, relegating it to background noise with no meaning or relevance." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 12-week trial, 65% of participants reported improvement, with some experiencing life-changing results. Audiology research fellow Dr. Phil Sanders noted, "For some, it shifted from overwhelming their lives to being manageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.958730/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, randomized 61 patients, comparing the polytherapeutic app to a widely-used white noise app. Significant improvements were observed in the polytherapeutic group, including reduced tinnitus severity and enhanced mental well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings mark a critical milestone in tinnitus treatment, emphasizing the potential of comprehensive, accessible digital interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Example screenshots for (A) the USL intervention (i) Menu, (ii) Passive therapy sounds, (iii) AOIL task, (iv) Tracking task.

By understanding each patient’s unique &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-tinnitus-therapy-could-greatly-improve-the-lives-of-40-million-us-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tinnitus profile&lt;/a&gt; and treatment goals, therapies can be customized to target specific symptoms or underlying mechanisms. Early efforts include goal-oriented counseling and personalized sound therapy, focusing on aspects such as attention retraining and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary studies have shown promise in combining behavioral interventions with digital tools. For instance, a prototype &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifesaving-smartphone-app-turns-your-phone-into-a-blood-pressure-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;smartphone-based digital therapeutic&lt;/a&gt; tested alongside counseling methods showed encouraging outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach integrates tools for relief and adaptation, guided by patient feedback and behavioral needs. As these methods evolve, they hold potential to transform the standard of care for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Audiogram for per protocol participants.

their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="rebellt-item
