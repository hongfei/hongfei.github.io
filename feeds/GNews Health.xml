							&lt;p&gt;At 60, you still feel mostly invincible. Sure, recovery takes longer after that weekend tennis match, and you've started holding restaurant menus at arm's length. But 80? That's another planet, barely visible from where you stand. Here's what geriatricians know that you don't: the choices you make right now—not next year, not after retirement—are writing the script for whether you'll be traveling at 80 or trapped at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is both terrifying and liberating. While genetics loads the gun, your choices pull the trigger. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8821855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major determinants of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt; aren't in your DNA but in three specific decisions that create a cascade effect over twenty years. These aren't expensive biohacks or exotic treatments. They're available to almost everyone. Yet most people ignore them, believing decline is as inevitable as taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research tracking why some 80-year-olds seem like they're 60 while others at 60 already seem 80 reveals the answer isn't in medicine cabinets or DNA tests. It's in three fundamental choices that, when made at 60, compound over two decades into either independence or dependence, vitality or frailty, engagement or isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Start lifting heavy things—your future mobility depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without intervention, you'll lose &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/age-related-sarcopenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;30% of your muscle mass between 60 and 80&lt;/a&gt;. Let that sink in. Nearly a third of your physical strength, gone. This isn't about vanity or beach bodies. This is about whether you can get off the floor after playing with grandchildren, carry your own luggage, or recover from a fall without breaking a hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Dr. Maria Fiatarone Singh's groundbreaking research took nursing home residents aged 86-96 and put them through eight weeks of high-intensity resistance training. The results stunned the medical community: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2342214/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;strength gains averaged 174%, with 9% muscle growth&lt;/a&gt;—essentially reversing a decade of decline. These were people in nursing homes, not athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what researchers emphasize: starting at 80 is like learning calculus when you can't do algebra. At 60, your body still eagerly responds to training. Your nervous system adapts, your hormones cooperate, your joints forgive. Wait until 80, and you're not just weak—you're metabolically broken, balance-impaired, and terrified of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that strength training at 60 changes your entire biological trajectory. Muscle isn't just for movement—it's your metabolic furnace, your glucose sink, your armor against falls. The people thriving at 80 aren't just the yoga devotees or marathon runners (though those help). They're the ones who learned to love the weight room at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prescription isn't complicated: twice weekly, 8-10 exercises, progressing from moderate to challenging effort. We're not talking about becoming Arnold. We're talking about becoming someone who never needs help getting out of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Protect your social connections like your life depends on it—because it does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910392/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social isolation kills as reliably as smoking&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad's meta-analysis of 148 studies covering 300,000 people found that loneliness and social isolation increase mortality risk by 26-32%. At 60, you're still socially rich: work relationships, family obligations, community ties. By 80, without deliberate cultivation, your world can shrink to medical appointments and whoever delivers groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Academies report found &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one-quarter of adults over 65&lt;/a&gt; are socially isolated. But isolation doesn't suddenly appear at 65—it's cultivated through a thousand small retreats starting at 60. Retirement removes daily colleagues. Friends move to Florida. Energy for maintaining relationships wanes. The infrastructure of automatic social contact crumbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with robust social connections showed 50% &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increased survival odds&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't just about emergency contacts. Loneliness triggers inflammation, suppresses immune function, accelerates cognitive decline. Your body literally breaks down faster when socially disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, you face a choice: coast on existing relationships or actively build new ones. This means uncomfortable things like joining groups where you know nobody, learning technology to maintain distant friendships, becoming the one who initiates rather than waits. Research on "social convoys" shows you need 3-5 deep relationships to thrive. These don't spontaneously generate at 80—they're cultivated now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel timeline: when you most need connections (80+), they're hardest to form. Mobility issues, hearing loss, shrinking peer pool—everything conspires against new relationships. Your social wealth at 80 depends on what you bank at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Challenge your brain with genuinely difficult new learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossword puzzles don't count. Neither does Sudoku number 10,000. The cognitive challenge that builds &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0588-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;—your brain's ability to withstand age-related damage—requires genuine struggle. Think less "brain training" and more "brain boot camp."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154531/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Denise Park at UT Dallas proved this definitively&lt;/a&gt;. Older adults learned quilting or digital photography—genuinely complex new skills requiring sustained effort over 14 weeks. Their memory improved significantly. The control group doing familiar activities? No change. The photography group showed the strongest gains, likely because they had to master technical information rapidly. The magic isn't in the activity; it's in the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, your brain retains remarkable plasticity. You can still form new neural pathways, still master complex skills. The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1504327" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt; has tracked cognitive function for decades: those who embraced cognitive challenges maintained superior function decades later, independent of education or baseline intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is stark: embrace cognitive discomfort or retreat to the familiar. Learn Python programming, study Mandarin, master the cello—something that makes you feel stupid regularly. The people sharp at 80 aren't the smartest; they're the ones who never stopped feeling dumb. They chose, at 60, to be beginners repeatedly, forcing their brains to build new highways rather than deepen existing ruts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The compounding effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three choices create what researchers call an "upward spiral of healthy aging." Strength training provides energy and confidence for social activities. Social connections offer accountability for both physical and cognitive challenges. Mental stimulation keeps you interesting enough that people want to connect. Each reinforces the others, compounding into either vitality or decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy is how many 60-year-olds think they have time. They'll start weights "after the holidays." They'll make friends "in retirement." They'll learn guitar "when things settle." But the research is brutally clear: the window for setting your trajectory is now. Not next year. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? If you're reading this at 60, you're at the perfect pivot point. At 70, change is harder but possible. At 80, you're mostly managing what you built—or didn't build—earlier. But at 60, you can still fundamentally alter your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question isn't whether you'll age—that contract is non-negotiable. The question is whether you'll be someone who ages with power, connection, and mental sharpness, or someone who ages into weakness, isolation, and fog. The research says the choice is yours. The doctors say these three decisions determine your outcome. The only thing left is to decide: which 80-year-old do you want to be?&lt;/p&gt;

Some brands can have up to 160mg of caffeine, almost triple that of an instant coffee, nearly 10-times the level of taurine, an amino acid commonly found in meat, fish and eggs, as a salmon fillet and the same amount of sugar as a full fat Coke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has previously suggested people who drink at least one sugary drink a day are at higher risk of suffering male pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study by Chinese researchers in 2023 found that younger men who consumed sweet drinks seven times a week had more than triple the chance of having hair loss than men who didn't consume them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the fresh research, scientists found that across the studies analysed sugary drinks impacted hair density, growth, thickness, shine, and hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study in particular, &lt;span&gt;those drinking more than 3500ml per week—roughly 11 cans—were more likely to suffer the condition, particularly men, researchers found. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have previously suggested this may be because high caffeine content in these drinks can increase cortisol levels, the stress hormone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excess sugar is also linked to poor circulation and inflammation which can both weaken hair follicles and increase hair loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the scientists also discovered that vitamin D&lt;span&gt; lowered risk of both androgenetic alopecia—the genetic type—and alopecia areata—sudden hair loss, when the immune system attacks hair follicles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One trial reviewed also found a lack of protein was linked to hair thinning and colours lightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Portuguese researchers found people who regularly consume sodas and fizzy drinks could dramatically raise their risk of hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, however, have long been divided over whether sodas and fizzy drinks are linked to hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Susan Massick, an expert in dermatology at Ohio State University, told Healthline at the time: 'Diet does play a critical role in your overall health, particularly regarding risk for developing obesity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, male-pattern hair loss is multifactorial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While hair loss is usually associated with ageing, dermatologists have said they are increasingly seeing younger men seeking help for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some going to the extreme, and expensive length, of getting hair transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated that around a quarter of men in their 20s show signs of balding — but by the age of 50, that figure rises to 85 per cent of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, earlier this month it was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14996641/hair-loss-study-pp405.html"&gt;revealed &lt;/a&gt;a breakthrough drug could provide new hair hope for millions of men and women dealing with baldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication, called PP405, triggered hair to regrow on the heads of men and women who were balding on the front and to the front and top of their scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the phase 2a trial, participants rubbed gel containing the medication onto their scalp daily and saw hair begin to regrow by week eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:48:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORXBpa2ZvS1BtUHJwSWltX2dxZmJ4ck9Ka3VlX192d2VURl9xYzJvX1hCOVg0TkxLNWlBOFBuRm81Y1dpa0dtZmlzZm00WXNybGJQT1gtY0p4eHJvY1liV0pzVDR6S1NjbWRScklwak1nQnJPWUtqOHRWZ1A4XzF2M3VFR2U3M0pNZGZjT09Td0h0RHUxSVBzOHk5N3NhX0dWVkQwVmJGM3nSAa4BQVVfeXFMTmVLaGVaWV9ZVVg2YVJnaVI5Z0hQZzZKU2RiS0dBLVI3S0ZjVWhIMEhXanFrOHdQN1pSTTBheXZ3emp3a2VOS0NUTHU2YUpXczBSX04xLWZPOUduRW15Ny1zOV9hUXhseEdoanE3Qi15M3RGOXdQdWF5YzFLdy1vOEtpRlg5cUhRZlR1ZmhRWkVmY0FDejRxR2FVMTlJdWtlaGNteU5OR3p0eUs4V1dR</guid></item><item><title>是什么让你头晕？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/08/25/dizzyness-causes-remedies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWL3B2ZPCRC2BKBAR23L5RLBUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;

Can his cure work for others." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;This summer, at the International AIDS Society conference, came news of an exciting new development in the the ongoing effort to bring the epidemic to an end. This story is the first in our annual end of August series, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Whatever happened to ..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;KIGALI, Rwanda — In a landmark first for the continent hardest hit by HIV, a new clinical trial in South Africa has delivered a rare but extraordinary outcome: One young woman may be cured of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The story begins in May 2016 when Anele got a call from nurses at a local clinical research center in Umlazi township, which lies in South Africa's southeastern province of KwaZulu-Natal. They told her she needed to come in for an urgent appointment, before breaking the news in person that she had tested positive for HIV. She felt like her world had ended.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I cried a lot," recalled Anele, now 32, speaking to a group of assembled scientists, doctors and health officials on the first day at the International AIDS Society (IAS) conference in Kigali, Rwanda in mid-July. "I was only 23. That day, I was not OK at all." Anele explained at the IAS conference that she did not want to be fully identified due to the ongoing stigma associated with being HIV positive in Umlazi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It may not have felt like it at the time, but compared with the &lt;a href="https://www.spotlightnsp.co.za/2025/03/31/8-million-people-living-with-hiv-in-sa-according-to-latest-estimates/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 5.2 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; other women living with HIV in South Africa, Anele was fortunate. Her early diagnosis and treatment plan were only possible because of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7593829/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new social empowerment and medical &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;program called &lt;a href="https://ragoninstitute.org/fresh/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRESH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health) which had begun in Umlazi back in 2012.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Six years after Anele's diagnosis, this program would see her enrolled in the first-ever clinical trial to attempt to cure HIV patients in Africa.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A trial born in Umlazi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(25)00193-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;July 2025 article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, 10 people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;worldwide&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are considered cured of HIV after receiving stem cell transplants to treat aggressive blood cancer, which happened to destroy the virus. But that method is not considered safe or scalable. In recent years other "cure trials" have explored newer approaches including &lt;a href="https://www.eatg.org/hiv-news/first-in-human-trial-of-crispr-gene-therapy-for-hiv/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gene editing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/clinical-trial-begins-using-car-t-cells-to-potentially-cure-hiv/2023/04" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAR T-cell therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to enhance immune response, but they have yet to yield successful results.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But almost all of these trials have taken place in the U.S. Yet 67% of the 40.8 million people living with HIV are in Africa where genetic and demographic profiles are remarkably different, said &lt;a href="https://hivmedicine.ukzn.ac.za/discipline-staff/professor-thumbi-ndungu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thumbi Ndung'u&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, who led the lab work for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the West, the epidemic is predominantly in white, homosexual men, while in Africa, the majority of people living with HIV tend to be younger and female," Ndung'u told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters for several reasons. Biological responses to HIV differ between men and women, influenced by sex hormones. Yet, said &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/914051/Krista-Dong" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Krista Dong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and FRESH's clinical director, women are vastly underrepresented in cure trials. "Women make up 53% of global HIV infections, but they're grossly underrepresented," Dong noted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-84718" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The biology of the virus also varies by region. While the dominant HIV strain in North America and Europe is clade B, sub-Saharan Africa sees mostly clades A, C, and D. Clade C, the world's most common subtype, has distinct features in how it interacts with the immune system, which potentially affects the success of curative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To develop a cure intervention that has an impact, we have to make sure it is something that works in Africa," Ndung'u said. "And the only way we can ensure that's the case is by actually doing the trials in these populations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strategy of kick and kill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;FRESH has taken a different approach from earlier HIV programs. In KwaZulu-Natal, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7593829/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;researchers have long noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that young women are particularly vulnerable to infection due to socioeconomic factors, including financial dependence on male partners and limited access to education or employment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iasociety.org/sites/default/files/Events/2022-HIV-Cure/18-The-FRESH-Cohort_Krista-Dong.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Launched&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 in Umlazi, where more than 60% of young women contract HIV before age 23, FRESH offered twice-weekly HIV testing along with an empowerment curriculum that included lessons on self-esteem and gender-based violence as well as career mentoring. Initially funded by private philanthropy and later the Gates Foundation, the program helped participants resume schooling or gain employment, while allowing researchers to detect HIV infections within days. (The Gates Foundation is a sponsor of NPR and this blog.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Having such frequent testing meant that the FRESH team could identify new HIV infections within a matter of days, enabling women to immediately start antiretroviral medication to suppress the virus, limiting the size and diversity of the viral reservoir. In theory, they would be easier to cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the clinical trial began. Twenty women enrolled, including Anele. All of them had been on antiretroviral therapy for an average of seven years. Sponsored by California-based drugmaker &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gilead Sciences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the trial used a new strategy: It aimed to flush HIV out of hiding, then neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The approach used a unique drug called vesatolimod to kick HIV out of its hiding places in the body, followed by a one-time infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) on day seven. These antibodies, tailored to target clade C, would bind to the virus and summon immune cells to eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"HIV doesn't live in our blood, it lives in reservoirs whether in the lymph nodes or the liver or the brain, so you need to kick it out, so that the bNAbs can reach it," Dong said. "So what we were going for was this strategy of kick and kill."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over 20 weeks, participants received vesatolimod biweekly. Then, on day 35, they were asked to stop their antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They had access to counselors and a community advisory board from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and FRESH staff, assuring that they would be monitored extremely closely. But when they were first diagnosed, nurses had emphasized that they would need to take antiretrovirals for the rest of their lives. Stopping this treatment came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The antiretroviral pause also carried real risks. When HIV rebounds, it can cause inflammation and raise the risk of transmission, but as Ndung'u explained, stopping this treatment is currently the only way to assess whether a patient is truly in remission. "We had to make sure that the participants fully understood the risks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Within a year, 16 participants saw their virus rebound and resumed treatment — but four remained in remission, with undetectable viral loads.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially cured&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, understanding what set the four women who stayed in remission apart could yield vital clues about who might benefit most from this treatment approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Ndung'u and Dong don't yet have firm answers, they have hypotheses. Ndung'u suspects genetic factors may have helped the four women mount a more effective immune response. Dong is investigating why the therapy failed in the other 16 – whether their viral reservoirs were larger or their immune systems reacted negatively to one of the drugs. Unraveling these differences could be key to improving future strategies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pair are eager to continue. Ndung'u hopes to launch a trial involving women infected at an unknown time — representing a more typical HIV population and possibly giving the antibodies more viral material to act on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also growing interest in how future cure trials might include participants with co-infections common in sub-Saharan Africa, such as tuberculosis or hepatitis B. "That's a unique but important challenge," &lt;a href="https://noguchi.ug.edu.gh/fellows/dr-helena-lamptey%EF%BF%BC/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Helena Lamptey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an immunology researcher at the University of Ghana, told NPR. "Many people with HIV have co-infections which are impacting the immune system and possibly helping HIV to persist." Cure strategies will need to reflect that reality.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, FRESH stands as a milestone. Of the four women who remained in remission at the trials' end, one later experienced a viral rebound. Two others chose to resume antiretrovirals – one for convenience after starting a new job that made weekly monitoring difficult, and the other to ensure a safe pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That leaves Anele. More than two years after stopping medication, she remains HIV-free and off treatment. While she remains cautious about declaring herself cured, Dong believes that it is a very real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Her case is fueling interest across the region. Researchers in countries such as Botswana have expressed the desire to run their own trials. With other new treatment possibilities emerging such as therapeutic vaccines and more advanced, long-lasting antibody infusions which Dong calls "super bNAbs," there is genuine optimism that a corner has finally been turned for people with HIV in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even though the FRESH trial was not a home run, achieving long-term viral control in 20% of the participants is exciting," Dong said. "It has brought hope to the community that progress is being made."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Cox is a freelance health journalist who has written for publications around the world including NPR, &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times, Wired&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;em&gt; He has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;analyzed data from nearly 16,000 adults aged 19 and older using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHAMES III).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined how much animal and plant protein people typically consume and whether those patterns were associated with their risk of dying from heart disease, cancer or any cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found no increased risk of death associated with higher intake of animal protein. In fact, the data showed a modest but significant reduction in cancer-related mortality among those who ate more animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of confusion around protein - how much to eat, what kind and what it means for long-term health. This study adds clarity, which is important for anyone trying to make informed, evidence-based decisions about what they eat," explains Stuart Phillips, Professor and Chair of the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University, who supervised the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure reliable results, the team employed advanced statistical methods, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method and multivariate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling, to estimate long-term dietary intake and minimize measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was imperative that our analysis used the most rigorous, gold standard methods to assess usual intake and mortality risk. These methods allowed us to account for fluctuations in daily protein intake and provide a more accurate picture of long-term eating habits," says Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no associations between total protein, animal protein or plant protein and risk of death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. When both plant and animal protein were included in the analysis, the results remained consistent, suggesting that plant protein has a minimal impact on cancer mortality, while animal protein may offer a small protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one cannot prove cause and effect; however, they are valuable for identifying patterns and associations in large populations. Combined with decades of clinical trial evidence, the findings support the inclusion of animal proteins as part of a healthy dietary pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When both observational data like this and clinical research are considered, it's clear both animal and plant protein foods promote health and longevity," says lead researcher Yanni Papanikolaou, MPH, president, Nutritional Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), a contractor to the Beef Checkoff. NCBA was not involved in the study design, data collection and analysis or publication of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Research has shown bananas are helpful for cardiovascular and digestive health, per the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/bananas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An average size banana contains about 450 milligrams of potassium. For reference, it's not the fruit with the highest potassium count (1 cup of jackfruit contains nearly double that amount), but it does offer about 13% to 20% of a person's daily recommended potassium intake. Adults should be getting between 2,300 and 3,400 mg per day depending on age, sex and pregnancy status, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health (NIH);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bananas also include 3 grams of fiber (adults should aim for 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day depending on factors like sex and age). That's "important for gut health," Nadeau notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Bananas are also a quick and easy source of carbohydrates, making them a perfect pre-workout snack for an energy boost," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to lower your cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/09/are-lentils-good-for-you/75312053007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adding lentils to your diet could help.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Adding lentils to your diet could help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What are the cons of eating bananas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the general population, health experts say there aren't a ton of downsides to eating bananas. But for people with certain health conditions, it may be best to limit your banana intake, or even steer clear of them in general; that's a question best answered by your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Per the Cleveland Clinic, those with elevated potassium levels or diabetes may run the risk of increasing their potassium or blood sugar levels too high by eating a banana. If you have diabetes, choosing a smaller portion of banana or one that's underripe (aka still green) could help with this. And people who are sensitive or allergic to latex may also be allergic to foods that contain a certain protein, including bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/25/how-much-potassium-do-bananas-have/85653187007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How much potassium do bananas have?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;How much potassium do bananas have?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 09:02:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5lOWFhVE5XT29lVkZoMWxnejU5RGt2N2lZUmVoY0RtQTRLRG5rSXEtTE9VaUQySEk4MFFVUGVkbnYwdms0MUdINGRPRkRWOV90RGlWTXdjVUNlOERsOXVKb28yVzBlWi11MGVKeEhnZExaUF83bkdISS1LanpxZw</guid></item><item><title>如何让男性去看医生？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/magazine/mens-health-doctor-masculinity.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 09:01:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNY3VGOE5OTk9DeTBUMVNQZXRwYXBqdmtmbGN6a2lrZERhYlVRcG9VRWw1eXg0VFN2VF9TbHhSWWpvdU42NHh4a0lOWFdIYm1jbnBpeUJ6ZHY1WmRHZHFpeTNHWlhSWmI4MV9TTkhIbEZJN0hSd3NIeE9HUDhrbFluLWFfdk9LQQ</guid></item><item><title>新的街头毒品“flysky”在宾夕法尼亚州西部引起警报。- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/regional/new-street-drug-flysky-causes-alarm-in-western-pa/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles surged in Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak soon became the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;worst the United States has endured&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in over three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;interfered with&lt;/a&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-trump-mmwr-bird-flu-studies-blocked-meddling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; the agency's &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-data-analyses-missing-mmwr-bird-flu-seasonal-influenza/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/cdc-dei-scientific-data/681531/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; its data, and abruptly &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-layoffs-federal-agencies-track-disease-regulate-food-health-insurance/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally," Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. "My staff feels like we are out here all alone," &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;she added&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak," one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. "All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;rates drop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-mmr-vaccine-myths/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mexico's Chihuahua state&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is absolutely outrageous," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. "When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The CDC is 'stressed' currently"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;late January&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this may be very large," she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;another email&lt;/a&gt; what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: "According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                  &lt;span class="embed__caption"&gt;A Feb. 3 email from Katherine Wells to a Texas state health official, Imelda Garcia, warning of a far larger measles outbreak than case numbers suggested. KFF Health News obtained emails throughFreedom of Information Act requests to local health departments. The emails have been redacted to protect the privacy of individuals and facilities. &lt;/span&gt;

What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;One email&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It never hurts to ask the CDC," said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CDC had gone dark," said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. "We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration's &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed," one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. "Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February," he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. "The CDC was gagged," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lay off&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's not that the CDC was delinquent," Benjamin said. "It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. "We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records "confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC," Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. "It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it," Holbrooks said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Locals guess&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;far larger&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt; count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community," Holbrooks said. "There's a lot of people in the shadows out here." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. "We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc7" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",7]'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data from prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented," Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm so overwhelmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A death ignites a response &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-death-texas-outbreak/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;brief notice&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;In emails&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;treating children&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported on a large drugstore&lt;/a&gt; where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were "flying off the shelf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788247/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;dire abnormalities&lt;/a&gt; during fetal development. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;one founded&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;inaccurately claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?" Milton asked &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. "HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials," one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. "If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they've had to "walk a fine line" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. "We're providing vitamin A," Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. "There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness," he claimed, "against serious disease and death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271920/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;seldom useful&lt;/a&gt; against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;inaccurate statements&lt;/a&gt;. "There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year," he said. "It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera." There is &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines "cause deaths every year." Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;doesn't cause&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;another interview,&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy said, "The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris." The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;does not contain&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Staff are exhausted"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Local hospitals are at capacity," &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. "The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now," &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;he added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding," Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. "Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;13 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc10" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",10]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another child in West Texas &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-second-child-death-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/a&gt; in late April. "There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas," Sugarman said. "We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. "A lot of people presumed their kids had measles," he said, "and didn't see the need to confirm it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-over-health-officials/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/a&gt; with measles on "medical mismanagement," &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;without evidence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;$11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/253.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; to the department's exhausted staff. "The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us," she wrote. "Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When they're not taking it [marijuana], their threshold of being able to handle anxiety is so low they actually require it just to function in daily life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-four percent of 19- to 30-year-olds used marijuana in 2022, the latest date available, or 25.3million people, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2023/08/marijuana-and-hallucinogen-use-binge-drinking-reached-historic-highs-among-adults-35-to-50"&gt;estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;, up from 28 percent that used the substance in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that users have a roughly 30 percent chance of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14183807/elton-john-america-worst-decisions-health.html"&gt;becoming addicted to weed&lt;/a&gt;, with signs of addiction including inability to reduce usage, constant cravings and relationship problems. Withdrawal can feature a lack of appetite, restless sleep, mood swings and, in more extreme cases, uncontrolled vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6106111/One-seven-Americans-used-marijuana-year.html"&gt;According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 2.7million Americans meet the criteria for marijuana use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Addiction may be attributable to the drug's potency, which has increased over time. Ryan Sultan, a psychiatrist at Integrative Psychiatry who specializes in substance use, said the strength of marijuana products had increased by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One of the marketing schemes is to talk about your [marijuana] being as strong as possible. When you get stronger, the risk of addiction for anything is going to go up,’ he told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More young adults are becoming addicted to cannabis, experts suggest (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pollock added: ‘Kids grew up with the idea from parents and [others] that weed is a very bad substance; it's illegal and you can't engage in it. All of a sudden, they're seeing it's legal with weed shops on every corner.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana is illegal at the federal level and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-11645727/How-America-surrendered-marijuana-KAYLA-BRANTLEY-reveals-pot-ubiquitous-US.html"&gt;fully legal in 24 states&lt;/a&gt;, plus Washington DC. More than half of Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, and 79 percent live in a county with at least one dispensary, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/08/facts-about-marijuana/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical dispensary sells ‘pre-rolls’, such as joints and blunts, as well as gummies and edibles. Dozens of strains are available from $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient that makes one 'high' after consuming marijuana, in most strains is around 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant rise in THC content from 1995, when the average batch of marijuana seized by the DEA had a THC content of four percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan said: ‘An old joint would have a little bit of weed, like a skinny, little coffee straw, and now we have these massive, enormous joints.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In weed pens and vapes, THC can reach percentages in the 90s. They are normally available for $50 to $100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pollock said: ‘Weed pens make it very convenient. They reduce the amount of smell quite a bit, so even in school or at work, it's very easy to hide it in comparison to other addictive substances such as alcohol, where it is much more apparent that someone is actively under the influence.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan is also concerned about the pens and vapes, as they are part of a trend of marijuana products designed for faster, easier consumption, with weed at its strongest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows how cannabis use has risen among 19-to-30-year-olds and older adults as more states have legalized the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, classified as Schedule 1, putting it in the same class as heroin and ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;President Donald Trump said in August that he was 'looking' at reclassifying the drug: ‘Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It's a very complicated subject, the subject of marijuana. I've heard great things having to do with medical and I've heard bad things having to do with just about everything else.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joe Biden’s administration &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/politics/marijuana-schedule-drug-biden.html"&gt;proposed &lt;/a&gt;moving marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug last May. A Schedule 3 drug, such as ketamine or testosterone, has 'moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan, however, believes there should be more oversight around weed, especially its source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weed grown illegally can be contaminated with pesticides or other toxic ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It's gone from a boutique hobby to organizations that are trying to make money. There's very little regulation or enforcement of regulation around quality [of] ingredients, whether the label is accurate or looking for pesticides. It's supposed to all be tested but a lot of the testing is a little bit of a joke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-19/california-weed-cleanup"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; found that 'more than half of cannabis smoking products in California’s legal market contain chemicals for which there is no public safety monitoring.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fd349949-440a-4047-8721-474f2a3c7e05"&gt;When you only have 15 minutes to spare, one of the best things you can do for your health is to go for a walk. Time spent outdoors is great for your mental and physical health, and if you want to challenge yourself, there’s a simple way to make it into a walking workout—just add structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denise Chakoian, a fitness trainer and the owner of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.corefitprov.com" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.corefitprov.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;CORE&lt;/a&gt;, rates walking workouts for the cardiovascular benefits while being gentle on your joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fd349949-440a-4047-8721-474f2a3c7e05-2"&gt;“For many people, especially beginners or those returning after injury, walking provides a safe way to build endurance without the strain that running or high-intensity workouts can bring,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chakoian adds that some of the many cardiovascular benefits of walking include blood pressure regulation, boosting circulation and strengthening the heart muscle, all of which can contribute to higher energy levels and an improved sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking also engages the large muscles of the legs and core, which improves posture and balance over time,” says Chakoian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a trainer’s standpoint, the accessibility of walking means clients are more likely to stay consistent, since it requires no special equipment and can be done almost anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can do this walking workout on a treadmill if you need a little extra support with balance, or if that is a more accessible option, Chakoian recommends getting outside as often as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-p4Su7x9hVwBZ5Bz6idkAbk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-p4Su7x9hVwBZ5Bz6idkAbk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking outdoors exposes people to fresh air and sunlight, which supports mood and vitamin D levels,” says Chakoian. “Beyond physical health, walking plays a major role in stress management and mental clarity. A steady walking routine helps lower cortisol and creates time to reset mentally, which is just as important as the physical benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-this-15-minute-walking-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-this-15-minute-walking-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do this 15-minute walking workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="df796964-503e-4002-8031-c82266b6d39e"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / wera Rodsawang)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="a3ecafad-37e3-4179-8330-def290d51629"&gt;Chakoian’s walking workout spends five minutes on the warm-up and cool-down.

			&lt;p&gt;The secret to stronger, whiter, healthier teeth has been hidden on the top of our heads this entire time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/toothpaste-made-from-hair-provides-natural-root-to-repair-teeth"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt; have devised a way to use a common protein found in hair to help regenerate tooth enamel; the substance that keeps people's pearly whites strong and pearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teeth aren't bones – a vital distinction that isn't just for pedantry, but an explanation for why they don't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-teeth-are-another-step-closer-to-reality-scientists-reveal"&gt;regenerate&lt;/a&gt; when lost or broken. So when tooth enamel erodes through diet, lapses in oral hygiene, or even aging, &lt;span&gt;exposing the softer, pale yellow dentin beneath, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;it's the start of permanent damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-teeth-are-another-step-closer-to-reality-scientists-reveal"&gt;Lab-Grown Teeth Are Another Step Closer to Reality, Scientists Reveal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dental decay can weaken a tooth's strength and stiffness (ability to resist deformation) by up to &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465"&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt;, leading to persistent pain and loss of function. The resultant cavities form holes in the teeth and may expose the nerve endings within, leading to hypersensitivity, potential tooth loss, and eventually even jawbone deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue is surprisingly common: the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/gbd-2019"&gt;Global Burden of Disease 2019&lt;/a&gt; reports that untreated dental caries (decay) in permanent teeth affects approximately 2 billion people. This makes dental decay potentially &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465"&gt;the most common disease worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and a cause of ballooning healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentally applied resins often used to fix decay can be toxic, inferior to real tooth enamel, and a burden to resource and material sustainability. And while fluoride treatments can slow enamel erosion, they cannot prevent or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the protein &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"&gt;keratin&lt;/a&gt;, which the researchers extracted from sheep wool (as opposed to our own hair) and placed in artificial saliva. The keratin pulled minerals from the simulated spit and assembled itself into something like tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, it behaved like it, too, filling in caries to provide enamel-like protection, function, and pearlescent brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For best effect, the researchers combined different types of keratin, and other proteins, to achieve various desired characteristics. These included a hierarchical (nesting-doll-like) structure that gave the keratin mix exceptional strength, durability, and resistance to numerous types of degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172013" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642.jpg" alt="diagram of keratin toothpaste research" class="wp-image-172013 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172013" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From sheep to teeth - the path of keratin toothpaste.

Products may be available in the form of a daily toothpaste, or a clinically applied gel, like nail varnish. Imagine going to the dentist to get your teeth varnished and seeing your smile transform over the following days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this research may propel the dental industry toward a more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-we-build-a-circular-economy-to-save-the-planet"&gt;circular economy&lt;/a&gt; founded on a "&lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/toothpaste-made-from-hair-provides-natural-root-to-repair-teeth"&gt;waste-to-health innovation&lt;/a&gt;," creating an essential healthcare resource from what are otherwise garbage materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Here's something that might surprise you: the person who leaves the party early to go home and read isn't missing out. They're onto something. While society pushes the narrative that happiness requires constant connection, those who genuinely enjoy solitude have quietly developed qualities the rest of us spend thousands on therapy trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research challenges everything we assume about loners. People who actively seek and enjoy time alone aren't damaged or deficient. They've figured out that &lt;a href="https://www.thepositivepsychologypeople.com/the-misconception-about-introversion-and-extroversion-enjoying-alone-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;solitude and loneliness&lt;/a&gt; are completely different things. One is being alone and feeling empty; the other is being alone and feeling full. Those who've mastered the latter have developed remarkably enviable traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They have bulletproof self-awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love solitude know themselves in ways that unsettle the rest of us. They can explain exactly why they reacted badly to that comment last Tuesday, what triggers their anxiety, which childhood experience shaped their thing about authority. This isn't narcissism—it's the result of spending actual time with their thoughts instead of drowning them out with podcasts and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; only 10-15% of the 95% of people who think they're self-aware, actually are. Those who regularly  spend time alone tend to fall into that rare category. They've had uncomfortable conversations with themselves that others avoid. They've sat with feelings long enough to understand them, not just react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Better decisions, stable relationships, less time wasted on things that don't matter. They're not guessing what they want—they know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They're creative without trying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solitude lovers don't need brainstorming sessions or creative workshops. Their minds naturally generate ideas because they've given their brains something most of us deny them: unstructured time. When you're alone without distraction, your mind wanders into the &lt;a href="https://introvertdear.com/news/introverts-alone-time-science-marti-olsen-laney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;—basically, your brain's screensaver mode where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when random thoughts collide to form new ideas. It's why people get their best insights in the shower or on long walks alone. Those who regularly seek solitude are essentially giving themselves multiple shower moments every day. They're not forcing creativity; they're creating the conditions where it naturally emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Cain, author of "Quiet," points out that many of our greatest innovations—from the theory of evolution to the personal computer—came from people who knew how to be alone with their thoughts. The correlation isn't coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're emotionally independent (and it shows)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone who loves solitude navigate a crisis. They don't immediately call six friends for advice or post vague status updates fishing for support. They sit with the problem, process it internally, then reach out if they actually need help—not because they can't handle feeling bad for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/emotion-self-regulation#:~:text=Emotion%20self%2Dregulation%20is%20the,illness%20in%20children%20and%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emotional self-regulation&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly rare. Most of us use other people as emotional regulators, constantly seeking validation, comfort, distraction. But those comfortable with solitude have learned to be their own emotional support system first. They still value connections, but aren't dependent on others to manage their internal weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their relationships are cleaner. They're not using friends as therapists or partners as parents. They show up whole, not as emotional vampires seeking completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They have laser focus in a distracted world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love being alone have trained their brains to do something most of us have forgotten how to do: concentrate on one thing for extended periods without checking their phone. They can read entire books. They can work on projects for hours. They can have thoughts that last longer than a TikTok video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't because they're naturally better at focusing. It's because solitude is essentially focus training. When you're alone without distractions, you have to learn to be with whatever you're doing. There's no one to talk to, no social energy to feed off. Just you and the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our attention-deficit culture, this ability to sustain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7851038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;deep focus&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a superpower. While everyone else is struggling with productivity hacks and focus apps, solitude lovers have been building this muscle naturally through their quiet afternoons alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They're authentically themselves (because they've met themselves)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something different about people who spend significant time alone—they seem more solidly themselves. They're not trying on personalities or adapting interests to match whoever they're with. They know what they like, believe, value because they've had time to figure it out without outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7851038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;authentic self-knowledge&lt;/a&gt; means less susceptibility to peer pressure, trends, manipulation. They've built identity from inside out, not from external feedback. While everyone wonders "who am I?" they've answered that question—multiple times, in depth, probably in journals they'll never share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, by caring less about fitting in, they become more interesting. Authenticity is magnetic, and they've got it in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They're masters of emotional intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the stereotype of the emotionally stunted loner, people who enjoy solitude often have superior emotional intelligence. They've spent so much time observing their own emotional patterns that they've become experts at recognizing them in others. They notice the slight tension in someone's voice, the forced smile, the subtle shift in energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from &lt;a href="https://fns.sg/the-four-archetypes-of-self-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;internal self-awareness&lt;/a&gt;—understanding your own emotions so well that you can recognize their echoes in others. Solitude lovers have done the homework on their own emotional landscape, which makes them surprisingly good at navigating others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're often the friends who check in at exactly the right moment, who know when to push and when to give space, who can sit with someone else's difficult emotions because they've already sat with their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They solve problems differently (and often better)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a problem to someone who loves solitude and watch what happens. They don't immediately crowdsource solutions or form a committee. They take the problem away, sit with it, turn it over in their mind, approach it from seventeen different angles. Then they come back with a solution that no one else thought of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because solitude allows for &lt;a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/divergent-thinking#:~:text=Divergent%20thinking%20expands%20possibilities.,make%20decisions%20based%20on%20evidence." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;divergent thinking&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. When you're alone, you're not anchored by groupthink or conventional wisdom. Your mind is free to wander down weird paths and make unexpected connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everyone else is following the same problem-solving playbook, solitude lovers are writing their own. They're not necessarily smarter—they've just given their brains the space to think differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They have unusual resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who enjoy being alone have a secret weapon when life gets hard: they're already comfortable with discomfort. They've sat through boring afternoons, restless evenings, anxious mornings without immediately reaching for distraction. They've learned difficult feelings pass if you let them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds emotional resilience that's hard to develop otherwise. When crisis hits, they don't panic about being alone with thoughts—that's their default. They know how to be their own companion through difficulty, never truly alone even by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've been doing exposure therapy for existential discomfort their whole lives. While others learn to sit with uncertainty through meditation apps, they've been doing it naturally for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They choose quality over quantity (in everything)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love solitude are ruthlessly selective—with their time, their relationships, their commitments. They've learned that everything has an opportunity cost measured in alone time, so they make sure it's worth it. This leads to a life that might look smaller from the outside but feels infinitely richer from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have fewer friends, but deeper friendships. Fewer hobbies, but genuine expertise. Fewer experiences, but more meaningful ones. They've figured out that depth beats breadth almost every time, and they structure their lives accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quality-over-quantity approach extends to their inner life too. They'd rather have one profound insight than twenty surface-level observations. One hour of genuine solitude beats ten hours of distracted alone time. They're not just choosing to be alone—they're choosing to be alone well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about people who love solitude isn't that they've opted out of society—most haven't. They've figured out you can't give what you don't have. All those qualities we admire—creativity, authenticity, emotional intelligence, resilience—grow in the quiet spaces we usually try to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot twist: people who love being alone often make the best company. They show up complete, not as needy fragments seeking validation. They listen better because they're not just waiting to talk. They're more interesting because they've actually developed interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the secret isn't forcing ourselves to be more social or to love solitude. Maybe it's recognizing that people who've figured out how to be alone have developed the very qualities that make being together worthwhile. They're not antisocial—they're doing the homework the rest of us keep avoiding. Judging by the results, maybe we should take notes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Cannabis compounds are showing early promise for healthy aging, a new study has found. However, much more research is needed to learn how results might differ depending on&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-long-a-cannabis-high-actually-lasts"&gt; the frequency of use&lt;/a&gt; and the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the UK reviewed 18 different studies across 15 years of research (2008 to 2023), involving both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_mouse"&gt;animal models&lt;/a&gt; and human participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By synthesizing findings from preclinical models, clinical studies, and real-world evidence, we aimed to elucidate the potential of cannabinoids, in fostering healthy aging, mitigate age-related decline, and promote well-being in older populations," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-linked-to-2x-risk-of-heart-disease-death-scientists-discover"&gt;Cannabis Linked to 2x Risk of Heart Disease Death, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists focused on the key cannabis compounds &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol"&gt;cannabidiol&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; (THC), finding some strong results for anti-aging effects in animal tests, and more mixed results in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the statistics are "promising" in terms of how cannabis can reduce inflammation and protect the brain, the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;. In animals, cannabis doses were linked to longer lifespans, improved learning, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution against overhyping these positive signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171458" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable.jpg" alt="Cannabis use" class="wp-image-171458 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171458" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cannabis use has been linked to both positive and negative health effects.

In people, we've seen it have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-study-yet-on-cannabis-and-brain-function-finds-a-worrying-link"&gt;damage memory function&lt;/a&gt; in one study, while also protecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/male-cannabis-users-seem-to-show-less-cognitive-decline-study-finds"&gt;against cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in another. These aren't easy results to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also keen to acknowledge that staying healthy into old age is dependent on a whole host of factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;what we eat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-much-sleep-you-need-for-successful-aging"&gt;how much sleep&lt;/a&gt; we get. Cannabis is only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While these compounds show promise in addressing specific age-related challenges, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet, regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and stress management remains crucial for promoting healthy aging and overall well-being," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cautious optimism, and the review does highlight a gap in our knowledge: we need more research into the effects of cannabis on people, involving greater numbers of participants, longer periods of time, and clearer signs of cause and effect when it comes to anti-aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drug is now being used more and more for medicinal purposes, and is legal in an increasing number of places in the world. However, there are still plenty of questions over &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-use-is-linked-to-epigenetic-changes-scientists-discover"&gt;just how cannabis use impacts us&lt;/a&gt; – based on age, dosage amount, and accompanying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population is getting older, and our bodies are being asked to live for longer than ever before, on average. Scientists are keen to figure out ways to ensure that longer lifespans can be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-past-100-experts-recommend-these-four-habits"&gt;enjoyed in good health&lt;/a&gt;, and careful cannabis use could be something worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With aging emerging as a global challenge linked to chronic diseases, identifying interventions that support a healthy lifespan and healthspan has become imperative," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Cannabis Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The materials are then processed and refined, releasing large amounts of heat-trapping gas along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the disposal end, less than 10% of plastic is properly recycled, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-pollution-health-crisis-disease-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; CBS, which means the majority of our plastic waste winds up in already overflowing landfills and in fragile habitats. Over time, plastic litter may leach chemicals into soil systems, water sources, and food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is plastic pollution concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new report references evidence to suggest that human health can be negatively affected by plastic pollution throughout the life course, from infancy onward, and with risks higher in young children. Potential health concerns include reproductive issues, cognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular problems, stroke, and cancer — and may total over a trillion dollars annually in economic losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In terms of its environmental tolls, the production of plastics generated close to 2 billion tons of heat-trapping gases in 2019 alone, &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/plastics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the United Nations. Just a few years later, the UN would take up the mission of convening global talks to reach an international treaty addressing the plastics crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In conjunction with its new report, The Lancet's Countdown on Health and Plastics was launched as an independent monitoring effort just ahead of the latest round of UN-hosted negotiations this August. Indeed, Countdown co-authors noted the "expected finalisation of this treaty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, by the end of this month's meeting, the talks had failed to reach an agreement, with oil-producing parties refusing to move forward with plastic production caps, preferring to lean on recycling and waste management strategies instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, rising global temperatures and plastic pollution are "causing disease, death and disability today in tens of thousands of people," Landrigan said, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-pollution-health-crisis-disease-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; CBS. "and these harms will become more severe in the years ahead as the planet continues to warm and plastic production continues to increase.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about plastic pollution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While researchers work to develop new and more flexible recycling technologies as well as plastic-sensing methods for detecting pollution, widespread &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/support-eco-friendly-initiatives-by-mainstream-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-plastic initiatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;anti-plastic initiatives&lt;/a&gt; and community cleanup efforts can help individuals tackle the issue as a collective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Households can take steps to reduce use and pollution by making simple &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic-free swaps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic-free swaps&lt;/a&gt; at home.

It’s fast, detailed, and helps catch problems that other scans might miss. Over the years, technology has made CT scans even sharper and more useful, which explains why hospitals and clinics are using them more than ever. In fact, in the US, the number of CT scans being done has climbed back up after the pandemic slowdown and is now higher than before. Simply put, CT has moved from being “special” to almost essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/experts-warn-of-salmonella-dublin-cattle-born-superbug-that-is-spreading-to-humans/articleshow/123487059.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/intermittent-fasting-can-increase-the-risk-of-heart-disease-finds-study-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/123488759.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Intermittent fasting can increase the risk of heart disease, finds study: Here's what it means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="7628252" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="JAMA-study" source="Orion"&gt;JAMA study&lt;/keyword&gt; highlights the life threatening risk associated with annual computed tomography (CT) examinations in the United States&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has found that the widespread use of CT scans in the United States could be linked to about 103,000 new cancer cases over the lifetime of those exposed in 2023 alone. With 93 million CT scans performed that year, researchers estimate that radiation from these scans could account for roughly 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually if current practices continue. The study highlights that while CT scans are an essential diagnostic tool saving countless lives, their radiation exposure is a known cancer risk, especially concerning children, who are more sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did researchers estimate the 103,000 future cancers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers estimated the projected 103,000 future cancers from the 2023 CT scans by combining several key data points and methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of CT scans: They used data showing that approximately 93 million CT scans were performed in the US in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation dose per scan: Each type of CT scan involves a measurable radiation dose, which is known from medical physics and radiology studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk models: Researchers applied well-established cancer risk models, primarily based on data from atomic bomb survivors and other radiation-exposed populations. These models estimate the lifetime risk of developing cancer per unit of radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic factors: The risk assessment accounted for age, sex, and the specific organs exposed during the CT scan, recognizing that younger patients have higher sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifetime risk projection: By multiplying the radiation dose from each scan by the associated cancer risk and the number of scans performed, then summing across all scan types and patient demographics, researchers estimated the total number of future cancer cases attributable to 2023 examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjustments for uncertainty: Researchers included statistical uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analyses to reflect confidence intervals in their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach integrates real-world CT scan usage data with recognized radiation risk science to provide a credible projection of the potential long-term cancer burden from medical CT imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cancers projected to result from CT radiation include lung, colon, leukemia, bladder, and breast cancers. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans contribute to the largest share of these cancer cases. The risk per scan is higher in children but, since adults undergo the majority of scans, most projected cancers occur in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasize that for individual patients, the risk from a necessary CT scan is low and the benefits usually outweigh the risks. However, the growing use of CT imaging, sometimes in situations without clear clinical need, raises concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How should one weigh CT scan benefits versus radiation risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighing the benefits of a CT scan against the radiation risk depends on your specific health situation, and it’s important to discuss this with your healthcare provider. Here’s a simple way to approach it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical necessity: If your doctor recommends a CT scan, it’s usually because the potential benefits, accurate diagnosis, guiding treatment, or detecting serious conditions, outweigh the small risk of radiation. Often, CT scans provide critical information that other tests cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: Consider your age, overall health, and frequency of past scans. Younger people and children are more sensitive to radiation. If you’ve had multiple CT scans recently, it’s worth discussing whether this scan is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatives: Ask if there are non-radiation imaging options like MRI or ultrasound that could provide similar information. Sometimes these are suitable alternatives with no radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation dose: Inquire about the radiation dose for your particular CT scan. Advances in technology have reduced doses significantly, and radiologists strive to use the lowest dose needed for clear images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication: Be open with your doctor about your concerns. Together, you can evaluate the urgency of the scan, potential health consequences of skipping it, and personal risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, if a CT scan is recommended by a qualified provider, the benefit of accurate diagnosis and treatment outweighs the risk. But it’s always good to have a clear, informed discussion tailored to your health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study calls attention to balancing CT scan benefits with their potential long-term cancer risks, urging more cautious and judicious use of this powerful imaging technology in US healthcare. "If current practices persist, CT-associated cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually," the researchers have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>长期新冠肺炎患者的生活与帕金森氏症和中风相当- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/life-with-long-covid-comparable-to-parkinsons-and-stroke</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When most people think of COVID now, they picture a short illness like a cold – a few days of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="171985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, sore throat or cough before getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for many, the story doesn't end there. Long COVID – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Post_COVID-19_condition-Clinical_case_definition-2021.1"&gt;defined by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) as symptoms lasting at least three months after infection – has become a lasting part of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="171985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research has focused on describing symptoms – such as fatigue, brain fog, and breathlessness. But we know less about their effect on daily life, and this hasn't been well studied in Australia. That's where our new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1071/PY25033"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt;, comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-are-trying-nicotine-gum-for-long-covid-could-it-treat-brain-fog"&gt;People Are Trying Nicotine Gum For Long Covid – Could It Treat Brain Fog?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show long COVID isn't just uncomfortable or inconvenient. People with the condition told us it can profoundly limit their daily life and stop them from doing what they want to do, and need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is long COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID affects about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/post-covid-19-condition-(long-covid)"&gt;6% of people with COVID&lt;/a&gt;, with more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-022-00846-2"&gt;200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt; recorded. For some, it lasts a few months. For "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1759568"&gt;long haulers&lt;/a&gt;" it stretches into years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the problem is hard to measure, because symptoms vary from person to person. This has led to debate about what long COVID really is, what causes it, and even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmqr.2022.100167"&gt;whether it's real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mounting evidence shows long COVID is very real and serious. Studies confirm it reduces quality of life to levels seen in illnesses such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/CPT.0000000000000291"&gt;chronic fatigue syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzac005"&gt;stroke, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's what people with long COVID told us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We surveyed 121 adults across Australia living with long COVID. They had caught COVID between February 2020 and June 2022, with most aged 36–50. Most were never hospitalised, and managed their illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But months or years later, they were still struggling with daily activities they once took for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642.jpg" alt="woman sitting on a couch with her head in her hands" class="wp-image-171991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life with long COVID can make normal activities a challenge. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEVkCgpKHI/"&gt;Pavel Danilyuk/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the impact, we asked them to complete two surveys widely used in health research to measure disability and quality of life – the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health/who-disability-assessment-schedule"&gt;WHODAS 2.0&lt;/a&gt;) and the Short Form Health Survey (&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form.html"&gt;SF-36&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surveys capture people's own voices and lived experience. Unlike scans or blood tests, they show what symptoms mean for everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with long COVID reported worse disability than 98% of the general Australian population. A total of 86% of those with long COVID met the threshold for serious disability compared with 9% of Australians overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, people had trouble with daily activities on about 27 days a month and were unable to function on about 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks such as eating or dressing were less affected, but more complex areas – housework and socialising – were badly impacted. People could often meet basic needs, but their ability to contribute to their homes, workplaces and communities was limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality of life was also badly affected. Energy levels and social life were the most impacted, reflecting how fatigue and brain fog affect activities, relationships and community connections. On average, overall quality of life scores were 23% lower than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the implications?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;International research shows similar patterns. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-023-00572-0"&gt;One study across 13 countries&lt;/a&gt; found similar levels of disability. It also found women had higher disability scores than men. As long COVID disability has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.28.24308048"&gt;many facets and can change a lot over time&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn't fit into traditional ways of providing health care for chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key insight from our study is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5435/JAAOS-D-23-00040"&gt;the importance of self-reported outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Long COVID has no diagnostic test, and people often report &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2025.108665"&gt;health professionals are sceptical&lt;/a&gt; about their symptoms and their impact. Yet our study showed people's own ratings of their recovery strongly predicted their disability and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows self-reports are not just "stories". They are valid and reliable indicators of health. They also capture what medical tests cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, fatigue is not just being tired. It can mean losing concentration while driving, giving up hobbies, or pulling away from cherished friendships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171993" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642.jpg" alt="worker looking fatigued, being comforted by another worker" class="wp-image-171993 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171993" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fatigue can interfere with work, hobbies, and relationships.

So ignoring the scale and severity of long COVID risks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/first-covid-hit-disadvantaged-communities-harder-now-long-covid-delivers-them-a-further-blow-183908"&gt;deepening inequality&lt;/a&gt; and worsening its impact even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building services based on lived experience, we can move towards restoring not just health, but dignity and participation in daily life for people with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need rehabilitation and support services that go beyond basic medical care. People need support to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000002368"&gt;manage fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, such as "pacing" and conserving energy by not overexerting themselves. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-024-10173-3"&gt;Workplaces need to accommodate&lt;/a&gt; people with long COVID by reducing hours, redesigning job demands and offering flexible leave. People also need support to rebuild social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this requires people with long COVID to be thoughtfully assessed and treated. Listening to patients and valuing their experience is a crucial first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We'd like to acknowledge the following co-authors of the research mentioned in this article: Tanita Botha, Fisaha Tesfay, Sara Holton, Cathy Said, Martin Hensher, Mary Rose Angeles, Catherine Bennett, Bodil Rasmussen and Kelli Nicola-Richmond.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263623/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/danielle-hitch-382866"&gt;Danielle Hitch&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Occupational Therapy, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/deakin-university-757"&gt;Deakin University&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/genevieve-pepin-519306"&gt;Genevieve Pepin&lt;/a&gt;, Professor, School of Health and Social Development, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/deakin-university-757"&gt;Deakin University&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/kieva-richards-2461600"&gt;Kieva Richards&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer in Occupational Therapy, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/la-trobe-university-842"&gt;La Trobe University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

							&lt;p&gt;Back in college, I had a roommate who would wrap himself in a thick comforter while our apartment hit 78 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AC was broken, windows were open, and there he was—cocooned like he was camping in the Arctic instead of sweating through a Brooklyn heatwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aren't you dying in there?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Can't sleep without it," he mumbled through the fabric fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought he was just being dramatic. But turns out, the need for blanket security—even when it's physically uncomfortable—reveals some fascinating things about how our brains work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After diving into the research (and interrogating every blanket-dependent person I know), I've noticed six traits that keep showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They're highly sensitive to their environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanket sleepers aren't just picky about temperature—they're tuned into everything. Like that friend who immediately notices when someone rearranges the furniture or can't concentrate if there's even the faintest hum from the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heightened sensitivity is actually a real thing. Researchers call it "&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/highly-sensitive-person"&gt;sensory processing sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;," and about 20% of people have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems pick up on subtleties others miss: the way light hits the wall differently, slight changes in air pressure, even emotional shifts in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these folks, a blanket isn't just about warmth—it's about creating consistent sensory input. The gentle, even pressure acts like a buffer against all those tiny environmental changes that might otherwise keep their brains alert and scanning for threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like wearing noise-canceling headphones, but for your entire body. The blanket creates a predictable sensory environment that lets their mind finally downshift into sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They crave routine and predictability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know those people who eat the same breakfast every day, take the same route to work, and get genuinely thrown off when their favorite coffee shop changes its menu? Yeah, they probably sleep with blankets year-round too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something deeply satisfying about having one part of your day that stays exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everything else feels chaotic—work deadlines, family drama, the general unpredictability of existing as a human—that familiar weight and texture becomes an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing this pattern when I was tracking my own sleep habits last year. On nights when my routine got disrupted—late dinner, different pillow, forgot to charge my phone—I slept terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one constant that helped me drift off, even on weird nights? My lightweight blanket, folded just so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket becomes part of a sleep ritual that signals to your brain: "Okay, we're doing this thing we always do. Time to power down." It's like having a consistent opening chord in the song of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're naturally more anxious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where things get interesting. Anxiety and blanket dependency often go hand in hand, and it's not just because anxious people are "needy" or "childish." There's actual &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're anxious, our nervous system is stuck in alert mode—heart rate elevated, muscles tense, mind racing through worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep pressure from a blanket triggers something called "deep pressure stimulation," which activates our parasympathetic nervous system (the "rest and digest" mode) and helps regulate cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same reason weighted blankets became so popular, or why some people find tight hugs incredibly calming. The pressure creates a physiological shift that anxious brains desperately need but often can't access on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend described it perfectly: "Without my blanket, I feel like I'm floating in space. With it, I feel grounded." That sense of being unmoored, untethered—that's anxiety talking. And the blanket provides literal and figurative weight to counter that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They're deeply introspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a stretch, but hear me out. People who need blankets for sleep tend to be the same ones who spend a lot of time in their heads—processing the day, analyzing interactions, planning tomorrow, or just letting their minds wander through random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introspective people often struggle with what sleep researchers call "&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90673-1"&gt;cognitive arousal&lt;/a&gt;"—their brains don't have an easy off switch. They're the ones lying in bed remembering a conversation from three weeks ago or suddenly solving a work problem at 11 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket creates a physical boundary that helps contain all that mental activity. It's like building a soft fortress around your thoughts, giving them a defined space instead of letting them scatter everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experienced this firsthand during a particularly stressful period where I was obsessing over a career decision. No blanket meant lying there mentally drafting pros and cons lists until 2 AM. With my trusty throw, somehow that same mental energy felt more contained, more manageable. Less like thoughts spiraling outward, more like them settling inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They value emotional security above comfort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, blanket sleepers will choose emotional comfort over physical comfort almost every time. They'll endure being hot, sweaty, or uncomfortable because the alternative—feeling exposed or unprotected—is worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about temperature regulation; it's about emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket represents safety, security, a known quantity in a world full of unknowns. Taking it away feels like removing a shield, leaving them vulnerable to whatever anxieties or worries might creep in during those quiet moments before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: sleep is when we're most defenseless. We're unconscious, unaware, completely out of control. For people who already tend toward anxiety or sensitivity, adding the feeling of physical exposure makes that vulnerability unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've watched friends choose to be uncomfortably warm rather than sleep without their blanket, even when they're complaining about the heat. It's not logical—it's emotional. And emotions don't care about logic when it comes to feeling safe enough to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is about being "weak" or "childish." Needing a blanket to sleep comfortably is just one way some brains have learned to self-regulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty elegant solution, actually—using something simple and accessible to address complex neurological and emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a year-round blanket sleeper, you're probably someone who feels deeply, notices subtly, and needs a little extra help creating the conditions for rest. That's not a flaw—it's just how your particular nervous system works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're sharing a bed with someone who insists on blankets in July, maybe cut them some slack. They're not trying to torture you with their body heat. They're just trying to feel safe enough to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most profound ones. A blanket isn't just fabric—it's a tool for emotional regulation, sensory management, and psychological safety. Not bad for something you can pick up at Target for twenty bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;THANKS to social media platforms like TikTok, there is a lot of hype around magnesium. But is the obsession warranted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Express spoke with general practitioner and social media content creator Dr Mariana Browne to learn more about the different types of magnesium and what they are good for. There are about five different types of magnesium salts that can help boost your magnesium levels. One of the most popular is magnesium citrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often use this to aid with constipation because it helps draw water into the gut and stimulate a bowel movement, explained Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium glycinate is another popular magnesium that many have been using. This can help with anxiety and aid with sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have patients who use it for their muscle cramps because it also aids with muscle relaxation. However, if you take it during the day it can make you feel tired,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium sulphate which was in the news recently is used intravenously in the hospital for severe asthma, pre-eclampsia, paediatric nephritis and to prevent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The least popular are magnesium malate which can help people boost energy and magnesium threonate, a form of magnesium that can help with cognition and memory. The mineral is also available in the form of magnesium oil which is also very popular on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This oil can be applied directly onto the skin and usually contains magnesium chloride which can potentially aid in anxiety, sleep and relaxation, said Browne. The application of magnesium oil is also believed to ease muscle pain and cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not all supplements are for everybody,” said the physician. “As with any supplement, I recommend not relying solely on magnesium, instead try to make necessary lifestyle changes. If you have problems sleeping, try to address the root cause behind your insomnia, exercise and do things that will make you tired naturally, cut back on caffeine and alcohol. If you have digestion issues, instead of relying on the magnesium citrate, eat lots of fibre and drink lots of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browne recommends having a conversation with your physician about whether magnesium or any other supplement is right for you especially if you are on medication or have a chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We're not just seeing CRPV, but we're seeing increases in Lyme disease and other mosquito-borne illnesses and tick-borne illnesses as well,' Dr Omer Awan of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-d44c1a30-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that the type of heat and moist conditions mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas thrive in has been spreading out into parts of the US that have never dealt with those conditions before. And the viruses affecting rabbits, squirrels, and deer are spread by insect bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the northern US and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-fece0f70-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, squirrels have been spreading squirrel fibromatosis, a virus causing wart-like growths that may ooze fluid but usually heal on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rabbits, cases of cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, have been spreading north throughout the Midwest, moving from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-fece0f71-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; to Minnesota, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nebraska/index.html" id="mol-fece0f72-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south-dakota/index.html" id="mol-fece0f73-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast have spotted cases of deer cutaneous fibroma, better known as deer warts. This condition is the same viral family as the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hpv/index.html" id="mol-13f603d0-811d-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt;, causing growths all over a deer's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user recently posted images of a rabbit in Shope papilloma virus in Saint Paul, Minnesota in late July &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Deer warts are spread by a virus which is transmitted through mosquito and tick bites. This deer, posted on X, was photographed in Ohio &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the sightings are taking Americans by surprise, experts assured that these grotesque conditions are not new diseases, but are centuries-old viruses that only infect the species carrying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan emphasized that humans cannot contract any of these conditions from wildlife or the insects that bite them. That's because each virus will not replicate in a tick or mosquito for it to be transmitted to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as the summer heat bleeds into more months of the year, the doctor warned that these disease-carrying pests are living longer and invading more states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That puts more Americans at risk for the other diseases they carry, including Lyme, West Nile, Zika, Dengue Fever, and Chikungunya, all of which are potentially fatal conditions in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The threat will not likely be year-round but certainly will expand by weeks, if not months, in the year. We will start to see these diseases become endemic in areas not thought to harbor these diseases, which is already occurring,' Dr Awan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a prime environment and climate for many of these illnesses to soar. I think it's sort of a perfect storm for many of these diseases to thrive,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AccuWeather has forecasted that the fall will be hotter than normal for parts of 25 states, particularly in the eastern and northwestern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AccuWeather's lead long-range expert Paul Pastelok said: 'There is a clear trend of hot and sticky summer weather sticking around longer into the back-to-school season across much of the East Coast and many other parts of the country.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The AccuWeather team added it's not just the fall forecast that's a problem; warmer temperatures throughout all of 2025 have affected the number of disease-carrying insects people will see the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Disease-carrying mosquitoes cannot transmit deer warts, squirrel fibromatosis, or cottontail rabbit papilloma virus, but they can infect humans with other illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Residents in Canada have also captured images of infected squirrels who were covered in hairless tumors associated with fibromatosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Warmer, humid weather doesn't just bring outdoor fun - it can bring mosquitoes. These insects thrive in wet, hot climates. The location's weather patterns over the past several months can determine how many mosquitoes emerge,' meteorologists explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While climate changes in recent years have helped the virus to spread, Dr Awan noted that there's one other factor contributing to the increase in mutated animal sightings: social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are starting to talk about it more, they're starting to document it more on social media, and hence, there's been a lot more discussion about this,' the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you look at a rabbit, you start to see these outgrowths through the head, the face, the neck. It certainly prompts your attention, and people take pictures of it, and they talk about it,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Colorado, there have been multiple sightings of rabbits with CRPV, particularly near the city of Fort Collins, over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) has urged anyone who sees infected rabbits to stay away and not touch them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reports of squirrel fibromatosis, or squirrel pox, date back to 2023, when residents in Maine captured images of common gray squirrels covered in tumors while visiting their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user posted an image in 2024 of a rabbit in Fort Collins, Colorado, exhibiting signs of Shope papilloma virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late June, a Reddit users photographed a young deer with its face completely covered in warts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While disease-carrying insects can transmit the virus, wildlife experts believe homeowners who put bird feeders in their yards may have also unintentionally caused the virus to spread to more squirrels who gathered there looking for food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shevenell Webb from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said: 'It's like when you get a large concentration of people. If someone is sick and it's something that spreads easily, others are going to catch it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for deer warts, the condition is part of the same broad family of viruses that can affect humans, known as papillomaviruses, which target the skin and mucous membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, papillomaviruses cause conditions like common warts, plantar warts, and genital warts, and some strains are linked to cancers such as cervical or throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts can be small, like a pea, or grow as big as a football, appearing gray, black, or fleshy and often hairless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is rarely fatal. The deer's immune system fights off the virus, and the warts shrink and disappear on their own after a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, if the warts grow too large or become infected with bacteria, they can cause problems like blocking a deer's vision or ability to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These include forgetfulness, difficulty learning, and slower reflexes. So what contributes to an aging brain? A new study has found the culprit behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, has identified a protein that’s at the center of this decline. The findings of the research are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aging and the &lt;keyword id="6361813" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain" source="Orion"&gt;brain&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a certain protein slows the aging brain, and they know how to counter it. Aging is particularly harsh on the hippocampus, which is the brain region responsible for learning and memory. To understand what aging does to the brain, the researchers looked at the genes and proteins in the hippocampus that changed over time. They observed this in mice model. What they found is significant for further research on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6039826/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that there was one difference between the old and young animals. It was the presence of a protein called FTL1. The researchers observed that the old mice had more FTL1, compared to the younger mice. Interestingly, the presence of FTL1 also led to fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand if FTL1 was the culprit, the researchers artificially elevated FTL1 levels in young mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was striking. They noticed that the brains and behavior of the young mice began to resemble that of old mice. In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites — rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers lowered the levels of FTL1 in the hippocampus of the old mice, surprisingly, they began to regain their youth. The old mice also had more connections between nerve cells, and also responded to memory tests in a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, said, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noticed that the FTL1 slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus in old mice.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you have diabetes, the focus is often on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; to better manage the disease and timing your meals with your medications. But understanding what specific foods and drinks interact with your medications is also key. “Diabetes medications are designed to work in a very specific way to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;control your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;,” says&lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/pharmacy/pgy2-pharmacy-residency-programs/pgy2-ambulatory-care-pharmacy-residency/pgy2-ambulatory-care-pharmacy-residency-preceptors" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; Elaina Rosario, Pharm.D., CPh, BCACP, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “When you eat certain foods, they can change how your medication is absorbed, how it works in your body, or how quickly it is used up. This can sometimes make the medication less effective, or in some cases, too strong.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccaemch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rebecca Emch, Pharm.D.&lt;/a&gt;, agrees, “From a pharmaceutical perspective, food interactions with diabetes medications occur through several mechanisms.” The effects vary depending on the type of medication you’re taking. “For medications like metformin, certain foods can affect absorption rates and bioavailability,” says Emch. However, this type of interaction isn’t as common since many times the foods in the diet don’t directly affect absorption of the medications. Instead, Emch says that it’s more common that foods eaten work against their intended purpose. “When you take a diabetes medication to lower blood sugar, and then consume foods that cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rapid glucose spikes&lt;/a&gt;, you're essentially creating a tug-of-war in your system,” she says. Other foods like those high in fat may also have an impact. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of these effects,&lt;a href="https://www.rikernutritionconsulting.com/about-cari" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Cari Riker, RDN, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes the importance of following a diet that helps you best &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;manage your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; while also preventing medication interactions. “Selecting foods that reduce these impacts can help improve tolerance and effectiveness,” says Riker. We’re sharing which types of foods may interact with your diabetes medications and tips on how to stay safe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some dietary fats like unsaturated fats are beneficial for health, but saturated fats in excess are associated with an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased risk for type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, meals that are high in fat may affect the bioavailability of certain medications. “High-fat foods slow digestion which delays how quickly some medications are absorbed and when they take effect,” says&lt;a href="https://nourishedwithdaria.com/about-diabetes-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Daria Zajac, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Examples of high fat foods include whole-fat dairy products, processed meats, fried foods and baked goods like cookies and cake.” Not only can they slow down how fast a medication works, according to Rosario, they can also trigger the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/common-side-effects-of-glp-1-medication-8778573" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-foods-high-in-added-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Foods High in Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  “Limiting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-packaged-foods-for-blood-sugar-8747313" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-sugar foods&lt;/a&gt; can help prevent rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar,” says Riker. This is because foods with added sugar may make it more difficult for your diabetes medication to work as intended. Emch points to high sugar foods like candy, sodas and desserts as well as fruit juices as some of the biggest culprits when it comes to foods that work against your diabetes medication. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These don't stop medications like metformin from working, but they make it significantly harder to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain stable blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;,” says Emch. “It's like trying to bail water out of a boat while someone else is pouring more water in.” This doesn’t mean avoiding all foods with carbohydrates and sugar. Instead, focus on whole food sources of carbohydrates that are also natural sources of fiber like beans and legumes, whole grains, and whole fruits and vegetables whenever possible. “The quality and quantity of carbohydrates matter,” says Riker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Highly Processed and Refined Carbohydrates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods that are primarily carbohydrates and are also highly processed like white bread, high sugar cereals, chips, pretzels, crackers and baked goods like croissants, cookies and pies can often cause a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-for-high-blood-sugar-11741305" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spike in your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;. “If you take a fast-acting insulin or a medication that works with meals, this sudden spike can make it difficult for the medication to keep up, or it could lead to a sudden drop later if the medication works too aggressively to bring it down,” says Rosario.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While your diabetes medication is designed to manage blood sugar, it's much easier for it to work effectively when your blood sugar levels are kept more stable.” If you choose to include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;highly processed or refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; in your diet, it can help to pair them with protein or fat as part of a balanced meal. This combination can help to slow digestion which may prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, most of the diet should not be made up of highly processed carbohydrate sources. “The American Diabetes Association (ADA) specifically recommends that people with diabetes preferentially eat minimally processed sources of carbohydrate that are high in fiber,” says&lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-us/board-of-directors" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Joshua J. Neumiller, Pharm.D., CDCES, FADCES, FASCP&lt;/a&gt;, president of health care &amp;amp; education at the American Diabetes Association.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications that are in the class of SGLT2 inhibitors like Jardiance, Steglatro, and Farxiga work by allowing excess sugar to be removed via urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The diuretic effect of these medications may be compounded by the diuretic effect of excess caffeine. This doesn’t mean a cup of coffee or two will be a cause for concern, but those taking these medications should consider sticking to the recommended limit of 400mg caffeine per day (or approximately three to four cups of coffee).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Alcohol should be limited when taking diabetes medications,” says Zajac. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach or when skipping meals may worsen the effect it has when taking diabetes medications. “Alcohol increases the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-too-low-11746496" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of low blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, especially for those taking insulin or sulfonylureas, since it interferes with the liver’s ability to release glucose into the bloodstream,” says Riker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Riker also says that alcohol can worsen side effects like nausea and digestive upset when taking medications like metformin. “For those on SGLT2 inhibitors (i.e. Jardiance, Farxiga), alcohol’s dehydrating effects can increase the chances of dehydration, low blood pressure and rare but serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following recommendations to limit alcohol is essential when undergoing diabetes treatment. “The ADA recommends that people with diabetes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume alcohol in moderation&lt;/a&gt; by limiting intake to ≤2 drinks per day for men and ≤1 drink per day for women,” says Neumiller. “It is important that people with diabetes understand that hypoglycemia can be delayed after drinking alcohol and that blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully to prevent severe low blood glucose levels.” For these reasons, it’s recommended that any alcohol intake is discussed with your doctor pharmacist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With so many diabetes medications available today, it’s difficult to provide one-size-fits-all recommendations when it comes to your diet and food choices. “Your pharmacist is a great resource for understanding how best to take your diabetes medications in relation to meals and if any specific types of foods should be avoided with your prescribed medications,” says Neumiller. These tips can get you started with making changes that work best for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider Meal Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to time meals and snacks appropriately depending on what’s recommended for your medication as different medications can have different effects. “Some medications need to be taken with the first bite of a meal, while others are taken 30 minutes before, and some are taken with your evening meal,” says Rosario. “Missing the right timing can affect how well the medication works.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; “Hydration is essential, especially for those on SGLT2 inhibitors like Jardiance or Farxiga, which can increase fluid loss and raise the risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance,” says Riker. Drink primarily water and other unsweetened beverages to promote optimal hydration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider Portion Sizes:&lt;/strong&gt; Some medications may require paying special attention to portion sizes than others. “For those on GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Ozempic, Trulicity, or Victoza, large or high-sugar meals may worsen nausea or lead to dumping syndrome,” says Riker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Monitor Your Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; “A tool that can be used to monitor how foods affect your blood sugar is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heres-why-you-shouldnt-measure-your-blood-sugar-with-your-smartwatch-according-to-the-fda-8601517" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;,” says Rosario. “They are available with a prescription and over the counter and provide a great insight on how food and your diabetes medications affect your blood sugar levels.” When you monitor your blood sugar, you can identify trends based on the foods you eat and the timing of your medications. “Pay attention to how you feel after eating certain foods. If you notice a pattern of feeling unwell or having unusual blood sugar readings after a particular meal, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian,” says Rosario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider All Medications and Supplements:&lt;/strong&gt; “Other medications and supplements can affect blood sugar or interact with diabetes drugs, so it’s important to consider your full medication list when planning meals,” says Zajac. Pharmacists are an important resource to patients when identifying potential food-drug interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing diabetes requires paying close attention to when and what you eat as well as the timing of your medication.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Monitoring your blood sugar is the best way to ensure your current plan is working for you. But seeking the care of a registered dietitian or other healthcare provider can be helpful to provide guidance and support, especially if you’re newly diagnosed. “Bottom line, it is important to work with your healthcare professional to be educated on possible side effects of your medication so you can better manage your blood sugar levels and prevent side effects,” says Riker.&lt;br&gt;

Hot pasta is easier to separate, he explained, and plastic breaks down in much the same fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At around 75 degrees, plastic water bottles don't break down all that much. However, people often transport and store water bottles &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/well/eat/plastic-water-bottle-health-microplastics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in their cars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in their cars&lt;/a&gt;, where ambient temperatures can soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The crucial temperature that that starts to happen in is around 140 to 170°F, which is very normal to get to inside of a hot car in the summertime. It's at that point that it starts to become more likely that you're going to pull particles or chemicals into your water," Tuten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is that concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics are particles of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters in size — and while their effects have yet to be fully quantified, a growing body of evidence links them to a number of adverse health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their small size allows microplastics to penetrate virtually every part of the human body, as well as soil, the ocean, rivers, and remote areas like Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ongoing research identified potential reproductive impacts, vascular damage, and cancer linked to exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Wei-Chin Ho, an assistant professor of biology at UT Tyler, cautioned East Texans about a higher risk of microbial contamination in extreme heat. While his warning concerned bacteria, it aligned well with what Tuten discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Just because you can not see [it] does not mean it is not there," Ho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Staying aware;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Staying aware&lt;/a&gt; of environmental risks like microplastics is important as scientific understanding of the issue evolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's difficult to &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid plastic entirely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid plastic entirely&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt; — particularly for personal water bottles and tumblers — is a great way to reduce direct exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec46XrRMPgZfQY79" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOTEg0VEoxekc5N2piVmZoRzdvYUFNcl9td3BreDI3RjcySHNoUFhRM3hyUGp5OUQ0dDhXbE5TUXNhUWk4YzRzOC1UR2ZzREFZemNWdGxid2ZONUtaOHZtM3pLLXVYeUxCX2RybFZCM25uRVBadWZsVUJ4RE5xVEM4cHVuRHg4OVZNZWdxMkFKalhkWENR</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， “毒药之王”正在世界各地的稻田中积聚- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-warming-rice-fields-around-the-world/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice feeds billions. It thrives in warm, wet fields and stores energy in a way that fits busy lives and tight budgets. Those same flooded fields can also make arsenic more available to rice plants, and some of that arsenic can end up in the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of field evidence points to a new twist: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/astonishing-global-heat-in-january-2025-defied-climate-expectations/"&gt;as the planet warms&lt;/a&gt; and CO₂ rises, flooded soils lose oxygen more often and for longer stretches. That chemical shift frees arsenic from soil particles, and rice roots take up more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-rice-and-arsenic"&gt;Climate, rice, and arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of outdoor trials, researchers report that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/world-water-day-2025-preserving-glaciers-protecting-our-future/"&gt;climate conditions&lt;/a&gt; expected by mid-century would increase the flow of inorganic arsenic – the harmful form – from soil to plant to grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work appears in a leading medical journal and was conducted by teams at Columbia University’s &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mailman School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, with collaborators in China and the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that this increase in arsenic levels could significantly elevate the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and other non-cancer health effects,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/lewis-ziska" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Lewis Ziska&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-arsenic-is-in-rice"&gt;Why arsenic is in rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenic occurs naturally in many soils and waters. In paddies that stay flooded, oxygen dwindles. Iron minerals that normally bind arsenic dissolve, and arsenic becomes more mobile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer conditions paired with higher CO₂ push that chemistry along, especially in fields that remain waterlogged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under future settings – temperatures &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-did-ipcc-choose-2deg-c-goal-limiting-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than 2°C&lt;/a&gt; (about 3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels plus elevated CO₂ – the balance tilts toward more inorganic arsenic entering the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not make every bowl risky. Local geology, irrigation sources, soil type, and farming practices all shape grain levels. It does mean that the odds can shift in places where paddies stay saturated for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-rice-and-arsenic"&gt;Studying rice and arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists did not rely on short greenhouse trials. They grew 28 rice varieties outdoors for roughly a decade using a Free-Air CO₂ Enrichment (&lt;a href="https://ess.science.energy.gov/face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FACE&lt;/a&gt;) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process releases extra CO₂ around crops in the open air so that sunlight, wind, microbes, and soil behave as they do in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those long-running field data then fed into models linking plant arsenic levels to typical rice intake and body size across major &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/feeding-the-world-without-harming-nature-the-complex-balance-of-farming/"&gt;rice-eating countries&lt;/a&gt; in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projections indicate a sizable shift in risk. Lifetime cancer risks, particularly for lung and bladder cancer, increased by 44% relative to ambient conditions. China alone may face 19.3 million excess cancer cases related to arsenic exposure through rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a health perspective, the toxicological effects of chronic iAs exposure are well established; and include cancers of the lung, bladder, and skin, as well as ischemic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-cancer outcomes also matter. The modeling points to increased risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases tied to long-term inorganic arsenic exposure in populations with high rice intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-risks-are-the-highest"&gt;Where risks are the highest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet and water sources shape exposure. Regions where rice is a daily staple and paddies are often kept flooded will see the largest impacts under warmer, CO₂-richer conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingesting rice in regions like southern China and Southeast and South Asia is already a significant source of dietary arsenic and cancer risk,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within countries, irrigation that draws from arsenic-rich groundwater can raise grain levels. Varieties also differ in how strongly they transport arsenic from roots to grain, which creates room for practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-bad-what-can-be-done"&gt;This is bad, what can be done?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetic-fixes-may-save-crops-from-climate-stress/"&gt;Plant breeding&lt;/a&gt; can help: select and develop varieties that limit arsenic uptake even when soils push it toward the roots. Breeders already see large differences among rice lines in how much arsenic reaches the grain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trillions-of-cubic-meters-of-water-is-used-to-grow-crops-each-year/"&gt;Water management&lt;/a&gt; is another lever. Continuous flooding increases arsenic mobility, while giving soils time to drain lets oxygen return, which can hold arsenic in less available forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-harvest steps matter too. Milling and cooking methods can reduce how much arsenic ends up on the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single fix works everywhere. Shifting water regimes, for example, can raise cadmium in some settings, so local testing and tailored management are essential to avoid trading one problem for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-moving-parts"&gt;Limits and moving parts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any mid-century projection carries uncertainty. Policies can bend emissions paths, and farmers adapt as technology and economics shift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diets change with income, urbanization, and migration. The underlying processes are well established. The decade of fieldwork done for this study adds weight because it includes real weather, pests, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/engineered-plant-microbiomes-the-future-of-crop-protection/"&gt;microbial communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rice-arsenic-and-human-health"&gt;Rice, arsenic, and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice remains a staple food, and the findings from this research don’t claim that every bowl on every table becomes unsafe. Instead, the scientists point to smarter ways of managing risk and a need to act upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers can adjust irrigation where feasible. Breeders can favor varieties that move less arsenic to the grain. Public health agencies can track arsenic in grains and irrigation sources to guide choices in hotspots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study underscores the urgent need for action to reduce arsenic exposure in rice, especially as climate change continues to affect &lt;a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/topics/global-food-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global food security&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping rice safe in a warming world is within reach: breed smarter, water smarter, process smarter—and cut emissions, because the air over our fields follows us to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:54:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZ3pJbENnR3VuVHZNY2JyWC1EaXZlanJsSVBxbENqWmhNWkJDWDBfUWVjYVdfQ0xqcWpWV0c2NTF5YlRiY3U5eTV0QzJKbEJRVkhUVE0wTElpSmpoYjU2ejNpaWNzcTQ2M2MyaXJ6R1ZSY3U0UVdKSGduZm10RktJckRTd0ZRQ1gyZlMyWE1YUkVFVURiTnNMN0VDM2d4a0V4ak5tSHVHRGlwQQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告疫情威胁，危险病毒病例增加一倍以上： “我们看到令人担忧的增长” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/health-officials-warn-epidemic-threat-235000423.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dozens of cases of a potentially debilitating vector-borne disease have been identified in the United Kingdom this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7419g1l488o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports, almost twice as many as last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the surface, this uptick in cases of chikungunya virus might not appear to be concerning in scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In all, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/chikungunya-virus-uk-symptoms-travel-advice-b2809382.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:73 people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;73 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. contracted chikungunya, up from 27 in the same span of time in 2024 — a 170% increase in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya is a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vector-borne illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vector-borne illness&lt;/a&gt;, infecting humans through mosquito bites.

health and happiness should not be reduced to a single number. The ability to do 11 push-ups doesn’t necessarily correlate with being healthy, happy, and/or confident. True personal growth should be measured by how you feel in your own body each day, rather than by arbitrary metrics such as the number of push-ups you can do. &lt;a title="fitness"

enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harvard Health confirms that the number of pushups a person can do is proportionate to one’s level of fitness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brown goes on to say that while not vitally important, exceeding these age-grouped goals is a sign that the individual is fitter than average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@katieyharrold/video/7488080584363904302"

statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“How many you can do at one time offers a real-time measurement of your strength and muscular endurance and is an easy tool to help you improve,” the Harvard Health website &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/rise-push-ups-classic-exercise-can-motivate-get-stronger-2019021810165" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"

becomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Push-ups don’t just tone your arms – they strengthen bones, improve cardiovascular health, and help fight off the effects of aging, especially for post-menopausal women.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another reason for exercising daily is the fact that muscles deteriorate 3-8% every decade after the age of 30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="doctor-shares-11-push-up-challenge-and-other-ways-to-get-healthier-68ab465550346-png__700"

diseases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brown says that more important than aiming for these popular eleven pushups or the age-specific plateaus she proposed, is keeping track of one’s &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/japanese-walking-trend-may-be-better-than-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;fitness&lt;/a&gt; and “build[ing] strength

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A daily cup of coffee could be blunting the effects of certain antibiotic treatments, according to a new study analyzing the reaction of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; bacteria to caffeine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The international team of researchers behind the study looked at 94 different chemical substances and how they changed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; specifically, how they altered the systems that control what gets into and out of the bacterial cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Around a third of the substances tested were shown to interfere with gene activity related to managing traffic in and out of the cell. But caffeine was the one that stood out. It led to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; absorbing a lower level of some antibiotics, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"&gt;&lt;span&gt;including ciprofloxacin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our data show that several substances can subtly but systematically influence gene regulation in bacteria," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/news-and-publications/press-releases/press-releases/article/study-finds-caffeine-can-weaken-effectiveness-of-certain-antibiotics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; microbiologist Christoph Binsfeld, from the University of Würzburg in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-can-mess-with-your-medication-a-pharmacist-explains-why"&gt;Coffee Can Mess With Your Medication. A Pharmacist Explains Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is part of ongoing research into what's known as low-level antibiotic resistance. Not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-warns-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the fully fledged kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, where bacteria adapt to resist targeted treatments directly, but subtler effects that are triggered by changes in how genes operate and the way that these bugs respond to their environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We already know that bacteria such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0048-6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;use these adaptive responses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to maximize their chances of survival in whatever environment they find themselves in. What's not known are the precise biological mechanisms being used, which can tell scientists more about how bacteria pathogens stay alive and how we might beat them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171596" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CaffeineBacteria.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-171596 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CaffeineBacteria.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CaffeineBacteria-600x355.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171596" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers spotted differences in the bacteria's response to antibiotics after contact with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="171594" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;. (Binsfeld et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis showed that a particular protein called Rob played a bigger role than previously thought in controlling what gets in and out of the bacteria cells. It was involved in about a third of all the changes spotted by the researchers, including those triggered by the introduction of caffeine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Caffeine triggers a cascade of events starting with the gene regulator Rob and culminating in the change of several transport proteins in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; – which in turn leads to a reduced uptake of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/news-and-publications/press-releases/press-releases/article/study-finds-caffeine-can-weaken-effectiveness-of-certain-antibiotics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; biological engineer Ana Rita Brochado, from the University of Tübingen in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's important to note that this research is based on tests carried out in the lab: it's not fully clear how this might work in actual human beings, or how much coffee you'd &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;actually have to drink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to make a noticeable difference to antibiotic response, but this is something future research can look into.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another discovery by the researchers was that the antibiotic weakening effect was not seen in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, another harmful bacteria closely related to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This is a response that seems to only apply to certain kinds of bacteria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are several ways that the research can be taken forward, to get a more precise idea of what we're dealing with here, but a better understanding of this low-level antibiotic resistance is essential to making therapeutic approaches &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psychedelic-drugs-have-huge-therapeutic-potential-an-expert-explains-why"&gt;&lt;span&gt;as effective as possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Based on these findings, we foresee a challenging, but unavoidable and important task in mapping key determinants of transport functions across different bacteria," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260"&gt;&lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research has been published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/aug/20/do-pediatricians-recommend-vaccines-to-make-a-prof/"&gt;PolitiFact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, artificial intelligence and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don’t know seeking to profit from your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-vaccine-hesitancy-may-be-driving-a-spike-in-pediatric-flu-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How vaccine hesitancy may be driving a spike in pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” Kennedy said in an Aug. 8 &lt;a href="https://mvau.lt/media/ab888656-9b01-48fc-8341-fc4588a3bbe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted on X. “They’re pressured to follow the money, not the science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and public health officials have been &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fielding questions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/no-doctors-dont-push-vaccines-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on this&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uvpediatrics.com/topics/who-profits-from-my-vaccine-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;topic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://shotofprevention.com/2014/10/22/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;for years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Four experienced pediatricians told us evidence-based science and medicine drives pediatricians’ childhood vaccination recommendations. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off of vaccines is counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it was really about all the money, it would be better for kids to be sick so you’d see more sick children and get to take care of more sick children, right?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your pediatrician making profits off childhood vaccines? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs money to stock, store and administer a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians sometimes store thousands of dollars worth of vaccines in specialized medical-grade refrigeration units, which can be expensive. They pay to insure vaccines in case anything happens to them. Some practices buy thermostats that monitor vaccines’ temperature and backup generators to run the refrigerators in the event of a power outage. They also pay nursing staff to administer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on pediatric workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-is-diverging-from-cdc-vaccine-guidelines"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the American Academy of Pediatrics is diverging from CDC vaccine guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and for its administration, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians also participate in a federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provides vaccines for free to eligible children whose parents can’t afford them. Participating in that program &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;isn’t profitable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don’t cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it’s valuable for patients, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don’t make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children’s Health Care System in Texas, said a practice’s ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terk’s practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn’t lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice’s patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies’ payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s driving your pediatrician’s vaccine recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics’ or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended vaccine schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, your pediatrician will consider your child’s health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a few children —  less than 1% of all children — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child’s doctor,” Diasio said. “Don’t get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/aug/20/do-pediatricians-recommend-vaccines-to-make-a-prof/"&gt;PolitiFact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, artificial intelligence and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don’t know seeking to profit from your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-vaccine-hesitancy-may-be-driving-a-spike-in-pediatric-flu-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How vaccine hesitancy may be driving a spike in pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” Kennedy said in an Aug. 8 &lt;a href="https://mvau.lt/media/ab888656-9b01-48fc-8341-fc4588a3bbe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted on X. “They’re pressured to follow the money, not the science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and public health officials have been &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fielding questions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/no-doctors-dont-push-vaccines-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on this&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uvpediatrics.com/topics/who-profits-from-my-vaccine-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;topic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://shotofprevention.com/2014/10/22/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;for years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Four experienced pediatricians told us evidence-based science and medicine drives pediatricians’ childhood vaccination recommendations. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off of vaccines is counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it was really about all the money, it would be better for kids to be sick so you’d see more sick children and get to take care of more sick children, right?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your pediatrician making profits off childhood vaccines? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs money to stock, store and administer a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians sometimes store thousands of dollars worth of vaccines in specialized medical-grade refrigeration units, which can be expensive. They pay to insure vaccines in case anything happens to them. Some practices buy thermostats that monitor vaccines’ temperature and backup generators to run the refrigerators in the event of a power outage. They also pay nursing staff to administer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on pediatric workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-is-diverging-from-cdc-vaccine-guidelines"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the American Academy of Pediatrics is diverging from CDC vaccine guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and for its administration, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians also participate in a federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provides vaccines for free to eligible children whose parents can’t afford them. Participating in that program &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;isn’t profitable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don’t cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it’s valuable for patients, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don’t make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children’s Health Care System in Texas, said a practice’s ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terk’s practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn’t lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice’s patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies’ payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s driving your pediatrician’s vaccine recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics’ or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended vaccine schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, your pediatrician will consider your child’s health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a few children —  less than 1% of all children — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child’s doctor,” Diasio said. “Don’t get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy — better known as Bobby, and the father of our current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. — delivered a &lt;a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/speech/address-at-vanderbilt-university/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;rousing address&lt;/a&gt; at Vanderbilt University that came to be known as one of his greatest speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting his presidential uncle John, who had himself &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/05/cia-agent-oswald-kennedy-assassination" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;been assassinated&lt;/a&gt; less than five years prior, Kennedy told those Vanderbilt students that they were the people who had "&lt;a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/university-of-southern-california-19601101" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;the least ties to the present and the greatest ties to the future&lt;/a&gt;" — a future that seemed, thanks to the Vietnam War and civil unrest stateside, dangerously close to not happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bobby Kennedy's hopeful promise to the United States' young voters couldn't seem further away in 2025, as his son's anti-scientific turn at the Department of Health and Human Services has led to all manner of hasty research cancellations that put their futures at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most damningly, the younger Kennedy has elected to "&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;wind down&lt;/a&gt;" the development of mRNA vaccines and cancel $500 million in research contracts because of his &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/measles-patients-vitamin-overuse-rfk-jr" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt;, particularly as it relates to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with its incredible efficacy at staving off further death from the coronavirus pandemic, researchers working with mRNA believe they may be &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/cancer-vaccines-mrna-future" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;close to achieving&lt;/a&gt; a monumental milestone: creating a &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/new-mrna-cancer-vaccine-delivers-stunning-results-sparks-universal-treatment-hopes/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;universal cancer vaccine&lt;/a&gt; using the promising biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2016, virologist Rick Bright headed the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) — the agency that pioneered mRNA research in the US — until he was illegally ousted by president Donald Trump in May 2020 for a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;whistleblower complaint&lt;/a&gt; about his first administration's promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an alarming &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;piece for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this past week, Bright likened American supremacy on mRNA research to a military advantage — one that RFK Jr. is throwing away with his ill-advised anti-vax policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the COVID vaccines, which were primed for success by years of prior research from BARDA, the US has been leading the charge on mRNA cancer vaccines. With the health secretary's errant and dangerous "skepticism," Bright wrote, that lead is at great risk of slipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the United States abandons mRNA, it will not simply be forfeiting a public health advantage. It will be ceding a strategic asset," Bright wrote. "In national security terms, mRNA is the equivalent of a missile defense system for biology. The ability to rapidly design, produce and deploy medical countermeasures is as vital to our defense as any military capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adversaries that invest in this technology," he continued, "will be able to respond faster to outbreaks, protecting their populations sooner than we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former BARDA head is not alone neither in his concerns nor his view of American mRNA research as a military asset. In an &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/08/22/losing-the-mrna-arms-race-00518439" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Johnathan Kagan, the cofounder of a biotech startup called Corner Therapeutics that works with novel mRNA applications, suggested that America could be poised to lose the vaccine war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get the impression that many people in Washington don’t realize we’re in the middle of a new arms race," Kagan told the magazine. We’re not in the middle of a nuclear arms race anymore. We’re in the middle of a biomedical arms race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan named China as our greatest "arms race competitor," and cited a recent visit to the country where COVID was first detected as proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is in an incredible position to take advantage of this," he said.

Women have been using this term to describe what they’ve been noticing in their genital areas after starting Ozempic or some other glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist. And that’s stirred up more discussions about getting labia puffing or labiaplasty to deal with these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Is ‘Ozempic Vulva’?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vulva” is the official way to refer to a female’s between-the-legs external genital parts. This is the proper anatomical terminology as opposed to the word “vagina,” which is often mistakenly used to describe what’s really the vulva. Most of your vagina—if you have one—is usually not visible from the outside as your vagina is the elastic, muscular canal that connects the uterus to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, your vulva consists of the openings to your vagina and urethra, the surrounding glands, your clitoris and the inner and outer lips of your vagina—also known as your labia. Your vulva also encompasses your mons pubis, the rounded area located in front of your pubic bones where hair typically grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, GLP-1 agonists have become the athleisurewear of medications—super-popular and mentioned seemingly everywhere. While GLP-1 agonists began as diabetes medications, the tides of their use really changed with the finding that these medications can cause significant weight loss. Speaking of tides, the active ingredient in the GLP-1 agonists end in “tide”—whether its semaglutide for Ozempic and Wegovy, liraglutide for Victoza and Saxenda, exenatide for Byetta and Bydureon, dulaglutide for Trulicity or tirzepatide for Mounjaro and Zepbound. &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796491" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796491" aria-label="A study published in JAMA Network Open"&gt;A study published in &lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796491"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that weekly semaglutide injections were associated with on average a 15-pound weight loss after three months and a 27-pound weight loss after six months. If you do the math, that’s an average loss of roughly five-pounds a month. That’s got a lot of people, including, surprise, surprise, celebrities, talking about GLP-1 agonists as if they were some kind of magical drug for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but in addition to the magical talk, there have also been people mentioning unexpected findings after beginning GLP-1 agonists, which brings us to the combination of the words “Ozempic" and “vulva.” This term is being used to describe the sagging skin, weaker muscles and dryness in the vulvar region that some GLP-1 agonist users have been noticing. Some have also commented on experiencing increased vaginal discharge after starting GLP-1 agonists. ”Ozempic vulva" is not an official medical term. Your doctor won’t be saying something like, “Looks like you have Ozempic vulva”—at least he or she shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;‘Ozempic Vulva’ Is Likely A Result Of Rapid Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the “O” word is being used, what’s being called “Ozempic vulva” is probably not directly caused by the medication itself. Instead, the sagging skin is a potential consequence of the rapid weight and fat loss that can occur with GLP-1 agonist use. While fat may seem like the enemy, the Thanos, when it comes to weight loss, fatty tissue actually serves various purposes including serving as energy stories and giving your different body parts their volume and shape. That includes giving your vulva, especially your mons pubis and labia majora, the volume and shape that people know and love. And when you use a GLP-1 agonist, you aren’t offered a menu where you can select the locations that you want to lose versus spare fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the fat pads beneath your vulva rapidly shrink, they can be like Ant Man in the movie &lt;em&gt;The Ant Man and Wasp&lt;/em&gt;, when he shrunk and then his hoodie became several sizes too large. That’s because the hoodie didn’t shrink with him at the same time. Similarly, with rapid weight and fat pad loss, your skin may not be elastic enough to reduce in size and area as well, leading to sagging skin and soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pelvic muscle weakness may be due indirectly to the way GLP-1 agonists work. GLP-1 agonists help with weight loss in large part by suppressing your appetite and the “food chatter” that happens in your head, often to the point that people forget and need to force themselves to eat, if you can imagine that. If you aren’t eating enough, you could also not be getting the necessary nutrients. This could lead to loss of lean muscle mass, which, in turn, could result in pelvic muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what may be causing the dryness and increased discharge that’s being reported on social media. Of course, when it comes to posts on social media, you can’t necessarily be sure of whatever’s being said. People may not be accurately conveying what their symptoms may be or what other things they may be doing besides taking GLP-1 medications. This can be unintentional or—here’s a shocker—some people can actually lie on the Internet. Imagine that. Therefore, using social media and other Internet posts for medical observations and advice can be kind of like listening to what’s written on the inside a bathroom stall or what’s said by some random stranger you met on the subway platform but somehow got into a conversation with about your genitals. More scientific studies are needed to confirm what else GLP-1 agonists may be doing to the vulvar region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Can Be Done About ‘Ozempic Vulva’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you do about “Ozempic vulva” depends on how bothersome the symptoms may be. If the only thing that’s bothering you is the appearance of your vulva, you’ve got to ask yourself how much your expectations of the shape down there are being shaped by other people’s unrealistic expectations and unrealistic things like porn. (Yes, that’s another shocker, porn can be unrealistic.) Remember what’s considered attractive is very subjective and greatly shaped by what’s seen in entertainment and various types of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, “Ozempic vulva” could be a sign that you may be going for weight loss a little too aggressively. A slower more measured approach could allow your body and your other daily behaviors to adapt. It’s important to make sure that you are concurrently maintaining proper nutrition and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sagging skin is causing actual functional problems like chafing, then you may want to see your doctor to first explore non-invasive options. Depending on your situation, your doctor may suggest various moisturizers and lubricants. There’s also the possibility that you may have something else going on at the same time. For example, perimenopause can result in dryness, discomfort and other symptoms in that area,&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/15/how-halle-berrys-perimenopause-symptoms-were-misdiagnosed-as-herpes/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/15/how-halle-berrys-perimenopause-symptoms-were-misdiagnosed-as-herpes/" target="_self" aria-label="as I’ve described previously in Forbes"&gt; as I’ve described previously in &lt;em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/15/how-halle-berrys-perimenopause-symptoms-were-misdiagnosed-as-herpes/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why seeing a doctor can be better than simply Sherlock Holmsing on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing muscle weakness, all of the above apply as well. Proper nutrition and exercise are important. Your doctor may recommend Kegel exercises and other types of pelvic floor physiotherapy to strengthen your pelvic muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;‘Ozempic Vulva’ May Be Prompting More Women To Consider Labia Puffing And Labiaplasty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are finding the sagging skin to be too bothersome to be managed via non-invasive approaches, there are procedures available. One of these procedures is labia puffing, This is where a doctor injects some kind of dermal filler, like hyaluronic acid or fat, into your labia majora, the outer lips of the vulva, to give them more volume. It’s ratehr similar to the penis filler and scrotal filler procedures that finance bros have been getting, &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/02/23/men-are-getting-filler-injected-into-their-genitals-to-get-larger/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/02/23/men-are-getting-filler-injected-into-their-genitals-to-get-larger/" target="_self" aria-label="as I’ve described previously in Forbes"&gt;as I’ve described previously in &lt;em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/02/23/men-are-getting-filler-injected-into-their-genitals-to-get-larger/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure isn’t as invasive as surgery but it isn’t completely risk-free. After all, you are getting a needle stuck into your genitals. You could get swelling, bruising, pain and other types of irritation at the injection site. Infection and greater damage are risks, especially if the healthcare professional doing the injection is not skilled, not careful, not qualified or not even a healthcare professional. There’s the rare possibility of allergic reactions. The filler could go in unevenly, resulting in labial asymmetry. Or too much filler could be injected, which could lead to labia with an exclamation mark after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the possibility that the filler could move or change over time. This can form lumps and other not so desired appearances. These are all reasons why if you choose to get labia puffing, you shouldn’t go cheap and look for a place that will offer coupons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A labiaplasty would be more invasive and involved. Typically, you’ll have to under some kind of anesthesia, whether its intravenous sedation plus local anesthesia or general anesthesia—which brings its own set of risks. The surgeon can do different things depending on what you want, ranging from cutting off excess tissue to reconstructing and sewing up different parts to inserting filler like fat. While this presents more options than labia puffing, it also increases all of the aforementioned risks. Remember the saying that the only minor surgery is surgery done on someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ozempic vulva” is yet another example of how GLP-1 agonists—while potentially very effective at helping you lose weight—are not magical, wonder drugs. It remains to be seen how effective they may be for different people over longer and longer periods of time. There’s a need for more studies to better determine this as well as the different potential effects and side effects. After all, there’s already been, oh, quite a few unofficial terms with the word Ozempic in them to describe the unexpected effects that people are experiencing with GLP-1 agonist use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got some good news and some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that a new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the good news is not all potatoes are equal: There are plenty of spuds you can keep on your plate, but one preparation has a clear downside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes —but the good news is not all potatoes are equal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Proxima Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re shifting the conversation from, ‘Are potatoes good or bad?’ to a more nuanced — and useful — question: How are they prepared, and what might we eat instead?” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/potatoes-may-increase-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-depending-on-their-preparation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said lead author&lt;/a&gt; Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed over 205,000 people for more than 30 years, taking a close look a their diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked diabetes chances by 20% — but other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That being said, they also found that replacing any type of potato with whole grain foods can lower your type 2 diabetes risk by 4%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And swapping fries with whole grains? That will cut your risk by 19%, while even replacing them with refined grains like white bread made a positive difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public health message here is simple and powerful: Small changes in our daily diet can have an important impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes,” said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Limiting potatoes — especially limiting French fries — and choosing healthy, whole-grain sources of carbohydrate could help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes across the population.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked their diabetes chances by 20%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fahrwasser – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/potatoes-arent-always-bad-for-you-its-all-in-the-preparation/"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; in the past year that’s looked at the relationship between potatoes and diabetes. The last one, out of Australia, found that people who ate the most potatoes had a 9% higher diabetes risk compared to those who ate the fewest taters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And their findings determined boiled potatoes to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we separated boiled potatoes from mashed potatoes, fries or [chips], boiled potatoes were no longer associated with a higher risk of diabetes. They had a null effect,” said Dr. Nicola Bondonno from Edith Cowan University’s Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute, which conducted the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s only fries and mashed potatoes [that increase risk], the latter likely because [they’re] usually made with butter, cream and the like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picking healthier potato recipes seems to be the key — especially since potatoes actually have plenty of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not increase diabetes risk. A previous study found boiled potatoes, in particular, had no effect on diabetes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Valentina Rychkova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have lots of antioxidants like flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic acids, which can help fight things like cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And while starch gets a bad name, potatoes have resistant starch, which feed your gut nutrients and good bacteria. That’s great for digestive health and controlling blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Polish &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/07/potatoes-could-hold-a-powerful-new-treatment-for-cancer/"&gt;researchers found that glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; — naturally occurring chemicals found in potatoes, peppers and goji berries — have some cancer-fighting properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Potatoes are just fantastic,” Caroline Susie, a registered nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-foods-bad-reputations-coffee-eggs-rcna147196" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens is, unfortunately, we tend to screw them up by not eating the skin or frying or mixing them with everything under the sun, like sour cream and butter and bacon”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing your gut health through a nutrient-packed diet is an important way to support healthy digestion, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;promote probiotic bacteria growth&lt;/a&gt; in your microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why we asked a gastroenterologist, who specializes in all things gut health, to walk us through her typical day of meals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To start the day, de Latour goes for a lighter breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I wake up and have a glass of water, and then I have a protein punch: I eat two egg whites every single morning," she says.

But egg whites are still a protein-packed option, especially for the doc, who isn’t incredibly hungry in the morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I don't have a massive breakfast," de Latour explains. "If it was up to me, I would never have breakfast, but it's so necessary to start your day with some protein."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And of course the gastroenterologist has a cup of coffee in the morning, too. Caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-gut-health-8598527" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly option&lt;/a&gt; that can aid in healthy digestion, per recent research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a filling breakfast that can further satisfy your appetite, try a high-fiber gut-healthy smoothie, like gastroenterologist Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8077126/gastroenterologist-breakfast-4-ingredient-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy blueberry-banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For lunch, de Latour goes for a plant-forward option like a salad, which is full of her favorite nutrient to recommend to her patients: fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Unfortunately, our country has a huge, massive issue: we're wildly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;under-eating fiber&lt;/a&gt; and it's very dangerous," she explains. This is supported by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as it’s reported that 90% to 97% of Americans aren’t consuming enough fiber in their diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We think that de Latour would love some of our highly rated high-fiber lunch salads, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8004437/kale-quinoa-apple-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kale, Quinoa &amp;amp; Apple Salad&lt;/a&gt; or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944538/orange-mint-freekeh-salad-with-lima-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Orange-Mint Freekeh Salad with Lima Beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dinner is normally the most filling meal of the day, which at times makes it difficult to prepare. But the gastroenterologist likes sticking with her go-to nutritious choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "For dinner, I'll have cauliflower rice with lentils, because it's a protein and fiber mix, specifically plant protein," de Latour says. "And I add some yogurt and some achar, which is pickled vegetables."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We love the protein and fiber combination from the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cauliflower-rice-recipe-8401635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cauliflower rice&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. These nutrients help you stay satisfied after enjoying a bowl. Yogurt and pickled vegetables are both bursting with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which are amazing for the health of your gut microbiome. The doctor sticks to water for her drink with dinner, ensuring that she is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/milk-hydration-benefits-11686387" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;refreshed and hydrated&lt;/a&gt; leading into the evening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "It sounds very healthy, but it's delicious to me," de Latour says. "Whenever you try to create a habit change, but you enjoy it, you're more likely to stick with it. So that's been really good for my health, and I love it."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you love a healthy meal, why not stick with it? We think it's great that the doctor found a fulfilling dinner she loves including in her regular rotation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the gastroenterologist focuses on nutrients over meal diversity. Including enough fiber, protein and probiotics in her diet is important for her goals, and de Latour considers a plant-forward eating pattern best to meet her health needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Find healthy foods you enjoy eating," de Latour advises. "If it's something that is good for you that you enjoy, you're more likely to do it."

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians bust the top myths when it comes to managing cholesterol including which foods you should and should not avoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all fats are to blame for high cholesterol, but saturated fat is one that should be limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight and age don't determine risk for developing high cholesterol, so routine cholesterol screenings are important for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 25 million adults over the age of 20 in the United States have high cholesterol, so if you’re trying to figure out what you can do to lower yours, you’re not alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some believe dietary cholesterol is the main cause, others think only genetics are to blame. Misinformation about cholesterol is rampant, and that can make it hard to take action.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people report that they’ve been told to cut out eggs and other foods that contain cholesterol after being diagnosed with high cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the latest research shows that dietary cholesterol has a relatively small effect on blood cholesterol levels, whereas &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-cholesterol-8691621" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and trans fat are much more influential in raising LDL (aka the “bad” cholesterol) levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Instead of avoiding cholesterol-rich foods altogether, I tell my clients to limit saturated fats found in fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products,” says &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also a good idea to focus on adding heart-healthy fats, like those in nuts, seeds, avocados and fatty fish, she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dietary modifications are recommended to help improve abnormal cholesterol levels, they may not be enough to make a significant impact on their own. “This is because blood cholesterol may be impacted by several other factors like sleep, stress levels, exercise and genetics,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “It is important to set small attainable goals outside of diet to improve your sleep, incorporate joyful movement and stress-management techniques,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that you need to cut out all fats from your diet if you have high cholesterol, but that simply isn’t true. “While some fats can play a role in the development of high cholesterol, not all fats are created equal,” says &lt;a href="http://carlyinthekitchen.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carly Hart, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that consuming too much &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and trans fat can increase the risk of developing high cholesterol, but unsaturated fats may actually help to minimize that risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Unsaturated fats have anti-inflammatory properties and can help to increase your HDL cholesterol (the “good” kind) and lower your LDL (the “bad” kind), reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke,” Hart adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of eliminating fats from your diet completely, work on increasing your consumption of unsaturated fats—by adding more nuts, seeds, avocado and fatty fish—and decreasing your intake of saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people with high cholesterol don’t have any symptoms, so it’s hard to know if you have it without testing. Some people with extremely high cholesterol may show physical signs of the condition, typically fatty deposits and xanthelasmas—yellow deposits around the eyelids. However, in more moderate cases, symptoms can be rare. That’s why it’s important to have regular checkups with your primary care doctor to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;monitor your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might think that only people in larger bodies can get high cholesterol, “but it’s possible to have high cholesterol at any size because it’s related to things like genetics, family history and the foods we eat,” says &lt;a href="https://tweducate.wordpress.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mandy Willig, Ph.D., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to have your cholesterol levels checked regularly regardless of body size. This means every five years for healthy adults over the age of 20, or every year if you have diabetes or a family history of heart disease. Monitoring your lab work allows you to catch any problems early on so you can address them and make any necessary changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-6-you-dont-need-to-worry-about-cholesterol-until-youre-older"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #6: You Don’t Need to Worry About Cholesterol Until You’re Older &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High cholesterol can develop at any age and often starts young, especially in those with a family history of heart disease,” explains &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In fact, about 7% of U.S. children and adolescents ages 6 to 19 have high total cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ideally, you shouldn’t wait until you’re diagnosed with high cholesterol to start being mindful of your eating pattern and lifestyle. Build heart-healthy habits early, like including more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt;, limiting saturated fats and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly and managing stress. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hardy recommends encouraging kids and adolescents with elevated cholesterol to stay active. Running around at the park with friends, jumping on a trampoline or joining a sports team may also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/walking-and-cholesterol-health-11792294" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost healthy HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Lowering Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes to your eating habits, exercise routine and other lifestyle changes can help lower cholesterol. But in some instances, lifestyle modifications aren’t enough to make a significant impact and your doctor may recommend adding medications to your cholesterol management plan. Here are some habits you can get started on now to help lower your risk:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re trying to lower your cholesterol, be mindful of your added sugar intake. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Added sugar&lt;/a&gt; can be found in places you least expect it, like in packaged bread, pasta sauce and ketchup. The American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugars to less than 6% of daily calories (about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 for men).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Up on Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-a-high-fiber-diet-recipes-to-make-first-11692499" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce LDL and total cholesterol. Willig recommends eating fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes to support healthy cholesterol levels at every body size. Try incorporating more high-fiber foods into your meals and snacks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol. &lt;/strong&gt;Heavy drinking is associated with higher LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt; can make a big difference when it comes to lowering your cholesterol and improving heart health, making all of your other cholesterol-lowering efforts more worthwhile. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Cardiovascular Exercise. &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise has been shown to increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides and LDL-to-HDL ratio.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add exercise that increases your heart rate, like going for a brisk walk, riding a bike or swimming. Try to do some type of movement each day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Try This Meal Plan for Better Cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol is more common than you think, but managing it starts with separating fact from fiction. Focus on increasing your fiber intake, adding heart-healthy fats and getting regular exercise. Remember, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-lower-your-cholesterol-naturally-11769022" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; can make a difference, but monitoring your cholesterol and working with your doctor are important for creating an effective plan for long-term success.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow33wt00123b79co7tvqt7@published"&gt;My husband (we’re both men) brought home a guy for a threesome without telling me, saying he wanted it to be a “surprise.” It was. The guy happened to be incredibly hot, so I went along with it anyway, but I think him springing this on me without consulting me first was pretty thoughtless. Should I try pulling the same trick on him and see how he likes it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow345v00153b7939qwg5c5@published"&gt;You’re asking if you should punish your husband for what? Bringing a hot guy home? Please. I agree with you that he should have asked you first, but he didn’t and you tacitly forgave that by having sex. If the experience was nevertheless unenjoyable or even if the shock of the proposition outshined the actual sex, a conversation is in order. Just ask him to talk about it with you first, explaining that this is not the type of surprise that you find fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow348f00163b79vgbcc3bj@published"&gt;But if the sex was really good and you’re miffed purely on principle, I’m going to urge you to try to center yourself in the realm of the practical. You could look at this as a new era in your relationship: your thirds era. Your husband’s method was a bit sloppy but you had fun anyway, and now there is more of that kind of fun that you can have. By all means, you have been given an implicit pass to do the same (at least once), and you should if you are so inspired and can remain in the original sharing spirit. But doing the same thing to him for sheer retaliation is escalating; he was “thoughtless” in your assessment. Don’t see and raise him with calculating and punitive. Keep sex fun and share a guy because it’s a hot thing to do, not to settle a score. Not only is that adding negativity where it doesn’t belong, it’d be treating the third as a pawn, not a person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbb002o3b79tvdgusgd@published"&gt;I’m a single, straight male who just turned 60. I’ve never really had much of a sex life outside of masturbation. I’m not a bad looking guy, as I’ve been told, but have never had much confidence in myself. The limited sexual encounters I’ve had have been mainly with escorts (that, however, is a topic for another day.) My question deals with ejaculation. Over the last several years, I’ve noticed a marked decrease in ejaculate strength and volume. When I orgasm, the result is often a dribble, and generally one shot. I masturbate 3-5 times a week on average. What I’d like to know is, is this normal for my age? If not, is there something that I can do to get a little more umph in my game?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As men pass the threshold of middle age, their pelvic floor muscles become weaker and less semen is ejaculated with less force—even down to none at all. Also, the seminal vesicles tend to empty less completely and may become partially blocked by the prostate gland as it enlarges. These are normal consequences of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002t3b794j062q7w@published"&gt;To put an even finer point on this, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17430422/"&gt;2007 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of more than 6,000 semen samples found that on average, the peak semen volume came from subjects between 30 and 35 in age, and the lowest volumes came from subjects who were ages 55 and up. Spitz adds that other factors that may play a role in semen volume include hormone balance, hydration, overall health, level of arousal and the strength of one’s pelvic floor.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002u3b79i2z103ao@published"&gt;This may be entirely out of your control, but you may want to consider exercising your pelvic floor (or doing kegel exercises, as they’re called). This typically involves squeezing your pelvic floor muscles repeatedly for periods of time. You can locate the muscle by stopping your flow of urine—working your kegels basically amounts to doing that same thing over and over. There are various online guides for these exercises—I use the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stamena-longer-lasting-sex/id1106687104"&gt;Stamena app&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing to consider is the usefulness of abstinence. A &lt;a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(04)00877-5/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 27 men followed for 16 months found that semen volume increased 11.9 percent per abstained day for the first four days of abstinence and 7.1 percent thereafter. Try taking a few days off and see if that boosts your balls.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002v3b79cv7exzhj@published"&gt;I don’t recommend any kind of supplements that purport to increase semen volume. Any kind of reported success from them is anecdotal and generally on a person-to-person basis (I’ve tried some for the sake of answering these very questions and saw no difference). “I know there are some supplements and despite a friend being one of the ‘founders’ of one of these I would not say they actually do anything,” Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College and my go-to urology source, wrote to me in an email regarding your letter. Something else you might want to look into: Medications (including urologic ones) may cause lower semen volume so if you had any changes recently in your regimen, that may be the culprit. Otherwise, “This isn’t something you need to see a doctor about. There isn’t much you can do,” wrote Welliver.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002w3b79zqfdjv2r@published"&gt;You should also pause to consider why this matters to you. Maybe it’s a way of providing to yourself that your body isn’t as old as the years suggest, or maybe you just like to think to yourself, “Look what I made!,” while gazing at the giant puddle of sperm you just produced. But since your play is largely solo, you’re the only one who’s judging. It’s great to strive for more than what you already are and can do, but self-acceptance is key for happiness. If you can’t boost your volume, find a way to be OK with that. Even if they aren’t big, your loads are still yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002y3b794gowgxf0@published"&gt;I am having an issue that while not the biggest problem in the world, is still something I would rather not deal with.  My wife and I have been together for seven years, married for four. Within the last year and a half, if we don’t have sex the previous night, I wake up with morning wood. I’ve tried jerking off when my wife doesn’t want to have sex, but it doesn’t work. If I don’t get laid or at least a blow job, I will be guaranteed to be standing at attention come morning.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd00313b793gti4kkd@published"&gt;Two thoughts on what’s going on here: Your reporting is imprecise (no shade, you aren’t a one-man scientist/subject and no one except me is truly concerned about your data), or this has something to do with hormones. Anecdotally, at least &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1bftql8/how_longstrong_is_your_morning_wood_my_bf_is_only/"&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt; reports a more likelihood to get morning wood if he &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; had sex the night before. Regardless, a person like you and a person like him are both likely getting multiple erections a night. The exact reasons for nocturnal penile tumescence, as it’s officially referred to, aren’t known, but it may have something to do with the bladder—perhaps as an alert of its fullness or because a full bladder &lt;a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/hippocampus/story/2020/male-erections"&gt;stimulates nerves&lt;/a&gt; that end up causing these spontaneous erections.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd00323b7917dursc4@published"&gt;Morning erections can be a sign of penile/overall health. They are something a lot of guys deal with, mostly by walking them off or peeing upon waking. If your wood is persistent, jerk off or ask your wife if she’s down for a morning bone. Morning wood can be annoying, but its absence can indicate something worse. “Morning and overnight erections are normal! They are good for penile health, bringing in nourishing and oxygenated blood,” wrote Welliver, the urologist I quoted elsewhere in this column. Embrace your morning wood—however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m healthy, fairly handsome, very intelligent, successful, musically talented, generous, and have a great sense of humor. But, I have the absolute most difficult time engaging any type of sex that involves my penis because it’s smaller than average, and noticeably so. It’s been over a decade since I’ve had sex, been on a date, or even had a kiss, because at this point, I have so little self-confidence that I haven’t even attempted to ask a woman out. The penis size issue is a mental block for me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/07/small-penis-solution-average-size.html"&gt;How do I move beyond this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cd92d0d7-721f-445b-938f-cbce28981299"&gt;Immune cells in the human brain may be critical to orchestrating the organ's development in the womb because they trigger a dramatic increase in an important type of nerve cell, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates suggest that these key cells, known as inhibitory interneurons, make up some 25% to 50% of the neurons in the adult cortex, the wrinkled tissue that covers the surface of the brain. In fact, the human cortex carries &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35737810/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35737810/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than double the number of interneurons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the mouse cortex does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These interneurons relay signals between other brain cells and help keep that signaling in check with a chemical messenger called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GABA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As the brain's main "inhibitory" messenger, GABA helps turn down brain activity by making neurons less likely to fire, thus balancing out the "excitatory" signals that amplify brain activity. Various disorders have been tied to problems with interneurons, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6256185/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6256185/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;epilepsy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6742424/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6742424/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3090452/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3090452/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="243cfeed-2538-43a7-aab4-998eadc98cd0"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This figure shows examples of organoids grown by the researchers, where in the center column you can see that IGF1 drives cells to proliferate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Yu, D., Jain, S., Wangzhou, A. et al. Nature (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09362-8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="b7cd3eee-1d89-451d-bb49-90df9d69727c"&gt;Now, in a study published Aug. 6 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8697653650723576302&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09362-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fminibrains-reveal-secrets-of-how-key-brain-cells-form-in-the-womb" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09362-8" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09362-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fminibrains-reveal-secrets-of-how-key-brain-cells-form-in-the-womb" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have uncovered a force that drives interneurons to multiply in the developing human brain — and they say it may be unique to our species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b7cd3eee-1d89-451d-bb49-90df9d69727c-1"&gt;"That's why we cannot use traditional animal models," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/diankun.yu" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/diankun.yu" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diankun Yu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant researcher in pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), told Live Science.

This structure is temporary, appearing around the eighth week of pregnancy in humans and disappearing about eight months after birth, Piao said. The researchers found a way to incorporate microglia into this model, which hadn't been done before, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the microglia in their organoids were a key source of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in the developing minibrains and that the substance helped to drive the dramatic increase in interneurons seen in early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ffdd769b-eba3-468e-9dc2-4c64705f040c"&gt;When the team tested what would happen when they turned off IGF1 signaling in various ways, they found that it blocked the rapid increase in interneurons. However, "when we deleted this gene in microglia in the mouse model, we did not see any change," Piao said. That suggests that this chain of events kicked off by microglia-made IGF1 may be unique to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings indicate an evolutionary adaptation of microglial function to support the increased demand for interneurons in the human cortex," the researchers wrote in their report. In short, this finding hints at a feature of human evolution that might help to explain our unique cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, organoids aren't exact replicas of the human brain, so there's a limit to what the 3D models can tell us. "So far the model is good enough for especially the proliferation stage, very early stage" of development, Yu said. But currently, these organoids don't do as well with later stages of brain development, he noted.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring cellular memory blocks cancer cells from adapting to escape treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/northwestern-university/"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Northwestern University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Northwestern University, based in Evanston, Illinois, is a leading research university with strong programs in materials science, energy, and biomedical engineering.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineers have developed a completely new approach to cancer therapy that doubled the effectiveness of chemotherapy in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on directly killing cancer cells, this pioneering method stops the cells from adapting in ways that allow them to resist treatment. By blocking this evolutionary escape route, the disease becomes more vulnerable to drugs already in use. The strategy not only nearly eliminated cancer in cell cultures but also greatly enhanced the impact of chemotherapy in mouse models of human ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the&lt;em&gt; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cancer cells are great adapters,” said Northwestern’s Vadim Backman, who led the study. “They can adapt to almost anything that’s thrown at them. First, they learn to evade the immune system. Then, they learn how to adapt to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation. When they resist these treatments, they live longer and acquire mutations. We did not set out to directly kill cancer cells. We wanted to take away their superpower — removing their inherent abilities to adapt, to change, and to evade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backman is the Sachs Family Professor Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering, where he directs the Center for Physical Genomics and Engineering. He also is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University, the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the International Institute for Nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chromatin is key to cancer’s survival&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer displays many unique characteristics, but its defining trait is its extraordinary capacity to survive. Even under attack from the immune system or aggressive medical therapies, tumors may shrink or slow down, yet they rarely vanish entirely. While genetic mutations contribute to this resilience, they occur too gradually to fully explain how quickly cancer cells adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backman and his team uncovered a central mechanism behind this phenomenon. They found that the structural organization of chromatin—the complex of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule involved in coding, decoding, and regulating gene expression. It acts as a messenger between DNA and protein synthesis and plays crucial roles in both genetic function and viral replication. Variants like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA support different stages of protein assembly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;, and proteins—governs cancer’s adaptability and survival against powerful drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromatin serves as the framework that determines which genes are active and which remain suppressed. Because nearly two meters of DNA must be compressed into a cell nucleus only one hundredth of a millimeter wide, chromatin is densely compacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining imaging, computer simulations, systems modeling, and live-animal experiments, the researchers revealed that the three-dimensional layout of chromatin not only controls gene expression and stress responses but also encodes a kind of memory of transcriptional activity within its packing geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 3D arrangement functions much like a self-learning algorithm, constantly reorganizing into thousands of nanoscopic chromatin packing domains. Each domain preserves a piece of transcriptional memory that guides how a cell behaves. Over time, these domains are shaped and reshaped by cellular experiences, reinforced, stored, and rewritten. When this system goes awry, it can contribute to cancer, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Alzheimer’s&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Alzheimer&amp;amp;#039;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia. The disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and communication. There is currently no cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, and even the process of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cancer specifically, disrupted chromatin packing gives cells greater plasticity, meaning they can more readily adapt and ultimately learn to resist therapies such as chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reprogramming chromatin to boost chemotherapy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest research, Backman and his colleagues created a computational model grounded in physics to examine how chromatin organization affects a cancer cell’s likelihood of surviving chemotherapy. When they applied the model across different cancer cell types and multiple classes of chemotherapy drugs, it successfully predicted survival outcomes even before treatment began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that chromatin structure plays a central role in cancer cell persistence, the researchers explored what would happen if they deliberately modified that structure. Rather than designing entirely new medications, they screened hundreds of existing drug compounds to identify those capable of reshaping the nuclear environment in a way that influences chromatin packing. From this effort, they identified celecoxib, an FDA-approved anti-inflammatory medication already in clinical use. Commonly prescribed for conditions such as arthritis and certain cardiovascular issues, celecoxib also happens to affect chromatin packing — a property that made it a strong candidate for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Several drugs, including celecoxib, can regulate chromatin and repress plasticity,” Backman said. “With this approach, we now can design strategies that synergize with chemotherapy or other existing therapies. The important finding is the concept itself. This particular drug just proves the point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study opens up novel therapeutic avenues to treat cancer that can supplement existing treatments,” said Rachel Ye, a graduate student in Backman’s laboratory. “It is exciting to see how we are unraveling the mysteries of genome organization through multidisciplinary approaches, and this paper is a strong result of that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experimental results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Backman, celecoxib and similar drugs could become a new class of compounds, called Transcriptional Plasticity Regulators (TPRs), designed to modulate chromatin conformation to prevent cancer cells’ adaptive abilities. The researchers found that combining celecoxib with standard chemotherapy caused a substantial increase in the number of cancer cells that died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After proving its effectiveness in cellular cultures, Backman and his team wanted to demonstrate its potential in a more realistic biological system. The team combined paclitaxel (a common chemotherapy drug) with celecoxib in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. The experiments revealed that the combination reduced the cancer cells’ adaptation rates and improved the inhibition of tumor growth — outperforming paclitaxel alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The animal model that we used has incredible predictive power for what happens in humans,” Backman said. “When we treated them with a low dose of chemotherapy, the tumors continued to grow. But, as soon as we combined the chemotherapy with the TPR candidate, we saw much more significant inhibition. It doubled the efficacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making chemotherapy more effective, the new strategy potentially could also enable physicians to prescribe lower doses of chemotherapy for their patients. Lower, yet still effective, doses could reduce the burden of chemotherapy’s infamously difficult side effects. That would mark a significant improvement in patients’ overall comfort and experience during cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chemotherapy can be so hard on the body,” Backman said. “A lot of patients, quite understandably, sometimes choose to forego chemotherapy. They don’t want to suffer in order to live a few months longer. Maybe reducing that suffering would change the equation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Future directions for other diseases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backman only has focused on cancer so far, but he thinks modulating chromatin conformation might be the key to treating various complex diseases, including heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases and more. Although most cells in a multicellular organism share the exact same genome, there are hundreds of cell types such as bone, neurons, skin, heart tissue, blood and so on. Understanding the physical rules governing how so many different types of cells, with such different functions, can result from the same instruction set is crucial; the conformation of chromatin and the cellular transcriptional memory are what allow all of these different cell types to “remember” which genes to express in order to perform their particular cellular function properly and to work coherently with the cells around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backman posits that some complex diseases, rather than being caused entirely by genetic mutations, may be rooted both in mutations and in cells’ losing their correct transcriptional memories. The loss of a cell type-specific transcriptional lineage in neurons has been associated with early stage neurodegeneration, for example. Cells can also forget which genes to express for normal function when they undergo stress, and that incorrect expression may then become written into the cellular memory, leading to loss of cell function or even disease. Reprogramming chromatin conformation could help restore cells’ correct memories, potentially enabling them to return to a normal state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In many diseases, cells forget what they should be doing,” Backman said. “Many impactful diseases of the 21st century are, to a large extent, related to cell memory. Each cell in our body has several thousand chromatin domains, which are actual physical elements of transcriptional memory. The computational complexity that happens in every single cell is equivalent to a 1984 Apple computer. Cells maintain memory for a long time, but they can also develop spurious memories or lose memories. Cancer cells take that to the extreme. I think what we have found here is the source code of cell memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by a Utah engineering professor shows that gait retraining can reduce pain and slow cartilage damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost one in four adults over the age of 40 live with painful osteoarthritis, a condition that has become one of the leading causes of disability. The disease gradually wears away the cartilage that cushions joints, and there is currently no way to restore this damage. For now, treatment typically focuses on pain management with medication, followed eventually by joint replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Utah, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;New York University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Founded in 1831, New York University (NYU) is a global research institution headquartered in Manhattan, widely recognized for its impact in fields like physics, neuroscience, and computer science.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;New York University&lt;/span&gt;, and Stanford University are now pointing to a promising alternative: gait retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year-long randomized controlled trial, participants who adjusted the angle of their foot while walking reported pain relief comparable to medication. Importantly, these individuals also showed slower cartilage deterioration in their knees compared with those who received a placebo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that for people with osteoarthritis, higher loads in their knee accelerate progression, and that changing the foot angle can reduce knee load,” said Uhlrich, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. “So the idea of a biomechanical intervention is not new, but there have not been randomized, placebo-controlled studies to show that they’re effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tailoring treatment to each patient&lt;/h4&gt;

This type of osteoarthritis is the most widespread, but the best foot angle to lessen stress on the medial knee varies for each individual, depending on their natural gait and how it shifts when they adopt a new walking style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous trials prescribed the same intervention to all individuals, resulting in some individuals not reducing, or even increasing, their joint loading,” Uhlrich said. “We used a personalized approach to selecting each individual’s new walking pattern, which improved how much individuals could offload their knee and likely contributed to the positive effect on pain and cartilage that we saw.”&lt;/p&gt;

These assessments revealed whether turning the foot inward or outward reduced knee loading more effectively, and whether a 5° or 10° adjustment was most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individualized evaluation also excluded participants for whom no foot angle adjustment could reduce knee stress. Including such individuals in earlier studies may explain why those trials produced inconclusive results on pain reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Placebo versus intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial intake sessions, the 68 participants were divided into two groups. Half were placed in a sham treatment group designed to measure the placebo effect. These individuals were instructed to walk with foot angles that were identical to their natural gait. In contrast, participants in the intervention group were assigned a foot angle adjustment that most effectively reduced stress on their knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups then took part in six weekly lab-based training sessions. During these sessions, participants received biofeedback in the form of gentle vibrations from a device attached to the shin, which guided them in maintaining the prescribed foot angle while walking on a treadmill. Following the training phase, participants were asked to continue practicing their new gait for at least 20 minutes each day until it became habitual. Regular follow-up visits confirmed that participants were sticking closely to their assigned gait, typically within a one-degree margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, all participants self-reported their experience of knee pain and had a second MRI to quantitatively assess the damage to their knee cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;

At the beginning of the study, participants received a baseline MRI and walked on a force-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras recorded their walking mechanics.

&lt;p&gt;“The reported decrease in pain over the placebo group was somewhere between what you’d expect from an over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen, and a narcotic, like oxycontin,” Uhlrich said. “With the MRIs, we also saw slower degradation of a marker of cartilage health in the intervention group, which was quite exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the quantitative measures of effectiveness, participants in the study expressed enthusiasm for both the approach and the results. One participant said: “I don’t have to take a drug or wear a device…it’s just a part of my body now that will be with me for the rest of my days, so that I’m thrilled with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A long-term option&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ ability to adhere to the intervention over long periods of time is one of its potential advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Especially for people in their 30’s, 40’s, or 50’s, osteoarthritis could mean decades of pain management before they’re recommended for a joint replacement,” Uhrlich said. “This intervention could help fill that large treatment gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this intervention can be clinically deployed, the gait retraining process will need to be streamlined. The motion-capture technique used to make the original foot angle prescription is expensive and time-consuming; the researchers envision this intervention to eventually be prescribed in a physical therapy clinic and retraining can happen while people go for a walk around their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We and others have developed technology that could be used to both personalize and deliver this intervention in a clinical setting using mobile sensors, like smartphone video and a ‘smart shoe’,” Uhlrich said. Future studies of this approach are needed before the intervention can be made widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever played hide and seek with your pups? If not, then this video will give you a glimpse into what it’s like to hide from your &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy. The clip will not only make you laugh, but it will also encourage you to do the same with your pet just to see their reaction. The reel is so adorable that it has fetched more than 13K likes at the time of writing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-puppy-s-reaction-to-owner-hiding-from-him-is-adorable"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy’s reaction to owner hiding from him is adorable&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This dog dad was in a playful mood when he decided to play a trick on his &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; pup, Goose. What did he do? He hid from his fur baby and recorded his reaction, which is nothing less than adorable. The adventure begins when the pet parent covers himself with the blanket and lies down on the floor. He then whistles to call his beloved four-legged pal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after hearing the cue, the white pooch comes running into the room, thinking to cuddle with his dad. However, the furball is surprised to see no one in the room. Confused, Goose sniffs around, even the blanket the dog dad is hiding in, but still could not find his parent. The dad whistles again, leaving the pup perplexed with the whole situation and wondering, “Where is the hooman?” He even checks in the “shoe box” just to be sure that his dad is not hiding there. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But soon enough, the good boy finds his companion and jumps on the blanket to tell his father he has been found. What follows next is lots of cuddles, kisses, and tail wagging. This adorable reaction of the pooch has encouraged the dad to “do this one again but with goose all grown up now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the video of the Golden Retriever puppy, uploaded on @gooseandhisadventures, left many netizens smiling from ear to ear. One person was smitten by the cuteness overload and commented, “Omg so cute babyyy.” Another user mentioned, “Goldis are so golden.” Meanwhile, another person said, “Those lil four paws jumps.” A pet lover even asked, “Is there anything on earth cuter than a puppy????” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
