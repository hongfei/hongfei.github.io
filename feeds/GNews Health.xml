However, small mutations in mitochondrial DNA can affect tissues with high-energy demands such as the heart, muscle and brain, causing devastating disease and, in some cases, death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother, and although males can be affected, they do not transmit the disease, researchers said. About 1 in 5,000 babies are born worldwide each year with mutations that can cause the disease, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, scientists have detailed how an IVF technique called pronuclear transfer has been used to combine the DNA of three people to reduce the risk of mitochondrial disease being passed down the generations, in accompanying studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The technique uses 99.9 percent of the DNA from a man and woman, with another 0.1 percent from a second woman’s donor egg. It works by transplanting the nuclear genome of an egg from the mother with the condition - which contains genes essential for individual characteristics like hair color and height - to an egg donated by an unaffected woman that has had its nuclear genome removed, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The resulting embryo inherits nuclear DNA from its two parents, but the mitochondrial DNA comes from the donated egg, researchers said. The treatment was offered to certain women at very high risk of passing on serious mitochondrial disease, in accordance with U.K. regulations that assess each application for the procedure on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eight infants &lt;strong&gt;- &lt;/strong&gt;who range in age from newborn to over 2 years old&lt;strong&gt; - &lt;/strong&gt;were assessed to be healthy, meeting developmental milestones and reported levels of mitochondrial disease-causing mutations that were undetectable or at levels unlikely to cause disease, the Newcastle University statement said. Three of the babies had levels of disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations of up to 20 percent, which is still below the 80 percent threshold for clinical disease, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doug Turnbull, a neurologist at Newcastle University who co-wrote the study, said it was the first to document a “cohort” of children who had received the treatment. He said it is the result of an extremely cautious approach by scientists and regulators that has been more than two decades in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People have used very similar techniques, but nobody’s quite used this particular technique,” he told The Washington Post in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s just absolutely critical when you’re doing a new technique to be cautious and to make sure … it’s as safe and efficient as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The procedure has also raised concern from some, including religious groups, about its ethics and the fear that it could open the door to further genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Peter Thompson, chief executive of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, which regulates the process in Britain, said that only people with a “very high risk” of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease are eligible for the treatment and that every application is assessed individually. As of July 1, 35 patients have been granted approval by U.K. authorities to proceed with the treatment since it was first licensed in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These robust but flexible regulatory processes allow the technique to be used safely for the purposes that Parliament agreed in 2015,” Thompson said in a statement in response to Wednesday’s news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have cautiously welcomed the findings, while stressing the importance of long-term monitoring and raising the prospect of whether the procedure offers advantages over embryo screening for genetic disease. Others have raised the issue of cost in the long-term project that is supported by Britain’s National Health Service and medical charity the Wellcome Trust, among other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mary Herbert, who is professor of reproductive biology at Newcastle University and lead author of the research paper, said “the findings give grounds for optimism” but further research is needed to “bridge the gap” between reducing risk of mitochondrial disease and preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turnbull said the team is also looking to improve medical techniques and follow up with the children involved for as long as possible to track their health outcomes. He said researchers are offering health assessments for five years, but it “would be lovely to be able to follow them up much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Joanna Poulton, a professor in mitochondrial genetics at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said “time will tell” whether the treatment results in “dramatic clinical advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The births come amid a wider boom in genomic sequencing and IVF start-ups that have sparked a wider debate about the ethics and science behind embryo screening and genetic preselection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the United States, those undertaking IVF typically test for rare genetic disorders stemming from a single gene mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. The use of donor mitochondria, however, is not permitted under U.S. regulations. In Britain, the creation of babies using DNA from three people was first made legal in 2015, hailed for its ability to prevent serious disease being passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/honduras-trans-woman-asylum-trump/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:An asylum seeker abandons her claim and leaves Trump’s America;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;An asylum seeker abandons her claim and leaves Trump’s America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/07/11/trump-rally-shooting-aaron-zaliponi-swat-team/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:He may have stopped Trump’s would-be assassin.

Even some of the possible causes require more research, they say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ccbed" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.10218" target="_blank"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in JAMA, gastrointestinal cancers have become the fastest-growing type of cancers diagnosed in adults younger than 50 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-306289" class="body-graf"&gt;The review, one of the most comprehensive looks at gastrointestinal cancer trends, summarized the findings of major international and U.S. cancer databases, plus 115 papers on gastrointestinal cancers published from January 2014 to March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-786d2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors underscore the need for people to follow the screening guidelines for colorectal cancer, which &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;suggest that people with an average risk start screening&lt;/a&gt; — usually a colonoscopy or stool test — at age 45. Since doctors don’t routinely screen for pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers in the U.S., the authors also call for new ways to screen more people for these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b076ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“This really points to the importance of trying to improve screening and early detection,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the review’s co-author and director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b6487" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the review, colorectal cancer is by far the most common early-onset gastrointestinal cancer, with nearly 185,000 cases reported worldwide in 2022 and nearly 21,000 cases reported that same year in the U.S. Diagnoses in the U.S. have risen 2% annually in people younger than 50 since 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb3245" class="body-graf"&gt;“It never used to happen in this age group, and now a very significant rise in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds are getting colon cancer,” said Dr. John Marshall, chief medical consultant at the nonprofit &lt;a href="http://colorectalcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research. In one of the most high-profile examples, actor Chadwick Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016 and died of the disease four years later at age 43.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f1ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Early-onset cases of pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers are also rising, according to the new study. Previous &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?searchresult=1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown a disproportionate share of those gastrointestinal cancer diagnoses were among Black and Hispanic people. Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest forms of cancer, with just &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;13% of patients&lt;/a&gt; surviving five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6677ef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because colorectal cancer is the most common, doctors said they have a better grasp of what might be contributing to these early-onset cases compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c691c5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can understand what’s going on in colorectal [cancer], I think it would really provide a lot of guidance to help us understand the other GI tract cancers,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb5c48" class="body-graf"&gt;Kopetz said there are likely multiple factors driving the increase in early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7083ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“The leading theory is that there is no single leading theory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6405bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s new review in JAMA suggests that most gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 are associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. One &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the review found that women who consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during adolescence had a higher risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46cefa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as a young adult,” Ng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb79f" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the association between &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184" target="_blank"&gt;sugary beverages and health issues&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola will start being made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup in the U.S., but the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/coca-cola-dodges-trump-says-soda-will-switch-back-cane-sugar-rcna219225" target="_blank"&gt;did not commit to the change&lt;/a&gt; when asked about it by NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93909" class="body-graf"&gt;Marshall said he suspects the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer could have something to do with changes in people’s gut microbiomes — the bacteria that live in our gastrointestinal tracts. Diet, antibiotic use, microplastics and exposure to environmental chemicals likely all influence a person’s gut bacteria, but scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of what a healthy microbiome looks like nor how it affects our health. That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;. But Ng’s review found that younger patients often have worse outcomes, despite typically receiving more treatments, including more surgery, radiation and aggressive combinations of chemotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b2210" class="body-graf"&gt;One reason could be that primary care doctors may overlook symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn or reflux in younger patients, thereby delaying their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cc69f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeling is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage, because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” said Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-732ba8" class="body-graf"&gt;But Ng said that even after controlling for the stage at which patients are diagnosed, young people still seem to have worse survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4322c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This makes us wonder as researchers whether that means that the cancers that develop in younger people may be biologically different and more aggressive, or maybe less responsive to treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 15:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNC13cnJFQlMxb21GUjQxdGtCcFFqLXRsTkprMUhYVkhLWWxSQmZmbURycFNrdlBHZXpkT2ZrbFUwZnJKYUtwME91emJiaWZmc1ctQUs3Rk9Wa2FQOUNXcGhGc1h3NTRBZFkwczlpUEN6ZGZvVEo0SDRmeVdlZGwyOTJUbGJzRzJHLTVXRzRYdXJPdWVEMTFjYU84d01acFZNVWtmd2dCTHAyTmNYVU5ITF9n0gFWQVVfeXFMTm1qc29YLUpsczRRdTJNRGtPZWV6dkpNTmVpVkRNY2JFZkdZR21FZDVnMUtVdDZyTkdWVVpmOWJvaVRzSkRib3lvS3ZqNGVCaXQ4TTNjX1E</guid></item><item><title>肩膀疼痛意味着我抬不起胳膊。这是令人惊讶的原因-每日邮报 | Shoulder ache meant I couldn't raise my arm.

The theory is that persistently high blood sugar can make the surrounding shoulder tissue thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he adds it is women in the 40 to 60 age bracket - the age at which most women go through the menopause - who are most at risk of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The question is, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested a link to the drop in oestrogen that occurs around menopause to an increased risk of frozen shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, says that women in their 40s to 60s - the age at which they go through the menopause - are most at risk of suffering from frozen shoulder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study by Duke University in the US, involving 1,952 women - of which 152 were taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) normally given to make up for the drop in oestrogen that occurs during menopause - found that patients who were not taking HRT were 99 per cent more likely to develop a frozen shoulder compared to those receiving HRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine in 2023 make sense, says Dr Elise Dallas, a menopause specialist at The London General Practice, as oestrogen 'plays several important roles in musculoskeletal health'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Oestrogen has anti-inflammatory properties and supports bone growth, as well as connective tissue health,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As oestrogen levels drop during menopause, collagen (an integral part of the connective tissue that forms the muscles, ligaments and tendons) can become stiffer, reducing the flexibility of joints, including the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fall in oestrogen levels also leads to an increase in levels of cytokines, compounds which can trigger inflammation in the shoulder joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This inflammation can cause pain, thickening of the ligaments, and tightening of the joint capsule - hallmarks of frozen shoulder,' says Dr Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, others argue that one study is not enough proof that the hormonal change that occurs during menopause is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Sharma says that as women aged 40-60 years account for most frozen shoulder patients, the condition 'will often get correlated with menopause, even though there is no direct link to the hormonal changes of menopause'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, as it is there is no 'cure' for frozen shoulder but treatments can help improve symptoms while the healing process takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, says Mr Sharma, is hydrodistension or hydro-dilatation, where a combination of saline, local anaesthetic and a steroid is injected into the joint capsule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The steroid helps in reducing the symptoms of the pain and the high volume of saline attempts to relax the capsule for increased mobility of the shoulder joint,' says Mr Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physiotherapy and exercise can help maintain shoulder strength - 'though sometimes exercises and physiotherapy can cause more pain when the frozen shoulder is in its initial and aggressive phase,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma tried physiotherapy and home remedies such as ice, wheat bags (small sacks that you heat up in the microwave), massages, a massage gun and 'every type of painkiller', which all helped short term, 'but sometimes the pain was horrendous'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even sitting to relax and watch TV was painful. I had to prop my left arm on a cushion because I couldn't let it drop to one side as it was too painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases patients may need an MRI scan to confirm diagnosis. Then a hydrocortisone injection. Mr Sharma says steroid injections 'help reduce inflammation and provide pain relief while the condition resolves itself naturally and can make the recovery journey more comfortable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Emma's GP initially refused to refer her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then fate intervened just before Christmas in 2023 when Emma fell, injuring her shoulder. She was given an X-ray and MRI in A&amp;amp;E, which confirmed her frozen shoulder diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor said they see many women of my age with it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma was referred a specialist at Kingston Hospital for a hydrocortisone injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had the injection in January last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I must admit, I've never felt pain like it,' says Emma. 'It was excruciating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within a week she felt some improvement and over the course of the next couple of months, her shoulder got progressively better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on holiday with her partner Stuart, 57, to Indonesia and Singapore, where as it happens, 'they refer to frozen shoulder as "50s shoulder" – clearly they have a better awareness of the link to menopause', says Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year on, the mobility in Emma's shoulder has improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My shoulder mobility is now around 97 per cent and although I find it too painful to do something like play tennis, which I used to do two or three times a week, I'm mostly back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm doing three or four aqua aerobic sessions each week to help it improve further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just want more women to know that if they start experiencing shoulder pain around this stage of life, it's worth seeking medical advice sooner rather than later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He will describe symptoms he thinks he is experiencing and has even asked me to look at various moles on his body (thankfully in non-intimate places) to ask if I think he should have them removed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6dkwz600153b77cw3bpnsz@published"&gt;Your boss does seem to have a real illness, but it has nothing to do with moles. I can’t diagnose him through a letter, but you might be right that he has hypochondria. Also known as intense health anxiety, it is a form of mental illness that can be disruptive and dangerous, but treatable. Two main syndromes are defined in psychiatry’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554399/"&gt;illness anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or excessive fear of developing a medical condition, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532253/"&gt;somatic symptom disorder,&lt;/a&gt; which involves excessive concern about physical symptoms. The COVID pandemic&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000120"&gt; exacerbated many people’s health anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. (Masking at work isn’t necessarily a sign of hypochondria, though; dangerous respiratory diseases are still circulating.) The availability of Dr. Google has created a new twist on hypochondria called “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29324396/"&gt;cyberchondria&lt;/a&gt;,” or excessive searching for medical information. You aren’t your boss’s psychiatrist, and this (among other things!) is definitely not your job, but you or one of your colleagues could tell him that intense worry about health is getting more &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-hypochondria-can-be-deadly-and-how-newer-treatments-help/"&gt;medical attention as a common and treatable problem&lt;/a&gt;—and potentially nudge him toward seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;

You could tell him that you’re simply too busy with your actual work to help search for medical information. You could say that it’s inefficient for you to do these searches since you aren’t experiencing the symptoms yourself and wouldn’t know what to follow up on. Or try the privacy approach: His perceived symptoms might lead to a diagnosis he wouldn’t want to share, and out of respect for his privacy, you don’t think it’s appropriate for you to dig into the medical literature. There’s also the “this is too serious for me” option: “I don’t feel qualified to evaluate and discuss information about health conditions, but the doctors covered by our employer’s insurance can help.”&lt;/p&gt;

I have been told I’ll receive a severance package, but I’ve had a few potential employers express interest in me. I don’t want to leave my already understaffed store without the help they need, but I know I need to protect myself in an uncertain job market. Nothing has been offered directly to me yet, but I’m very tempted by one potential employer. The employer I’m interested in knows my current employer well, and I’m scared my current employer will find out I’m on the hunt and fire me preemptively. He’s known for making snap decisions. How do I know when/if to jump ship?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qqy001z3b7704k8qrtt@published"&gt;Your current employer did the right thing by admitting that the company is going out of business. And they are right to offer severance to reward people who stay until the end. Did they tell you how much severance? If it’s, say, three months’ worth of your salary or more, it would probably make financial sense to stay. You could use the severance-funded time to do a thorough job search, and maybe take some time off between jobs. But if they’re being vague about the amount, or if you’re worried the severance could disappear when the company does, don’t let it tie you to a doomed employer. Companies fire people all the time for their own reasons; you have every right to quit for yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr000203b77j3448qbt@published"&gt;It sounds like you need more information, and I think it’s worth the risk to have honest-ish conversations with both your current and potential employers. I suggest you start with the latter. Tell them you feel a sense of loyalty to your existing team. (Taking your job seriously makes you even more attractive as a potential hire.) Follow up by saying that you admire the future employer’s work and are intrigued by the possibility of joining them. It’s usually a good idea in a job interview (or pre-interview) to express enthusiasm for the future employer, which explains why you’re talking with them despite your loyalty to your current job. Say explicitly that you would like to keep this conversation confidential for now since you’re not actively looking for work. A potential employer should never share hiring conversations, period, but people are lousy at secrets, and it’s reasonable to confirm that they won’t mention it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Are they open about their timeline for hiring you? If they do make an offer and want you to start right away, you could use your dilemma during negotiations. Mention that you would be giving up a severance package if you leave your other job before the end of the year … but if there’s room to increase their salary offer, that would make your decision easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr300223b77y4r46chf@published"&gt;If you decide to stay in your current job, you could use these overtures to push for more information or opportunities. Tell your boss you appreciate his honesty about the company going out of business. Say you’d like to stay to the end, and you have not been looking for a job, but you have been approached by potential future employers. If Mr. Snap Decisions looks like he’s about to blow a gasket, backtrack by telling him you just thought he deserved to know that competitors are taking an interest in his employees, and cut the conversation short.&lt;/p&gt;

The company is understaffed, and closing down a business is complicated, so there might be opportunities for you to take on interesting new responsibilities and develop different skills. Tell your boss you’re hoping to make the most of the next few months in the job and you’d like to find out more about what you can contribute. You might even be able to get a new title by the end that could help you get a job at the next level, wherever you land next.&lt;/p&gt;

I was offered a new job, and I am two weeks in. It is in the realm of what I want to be doing. My stress levels aren’t as high, and I don’t fear working in an unsafe environment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xib002h3b77p029oz9b@published"&gt;However, there’s a downside. I am struggling with feeling as though I’ve become a babysitter to the older residents who are residing there while receiving medical care. That is not part of the job description. They have aides, they are just not always present in the areas where I am assigned, but the aides should be around at all times due to the fall risks of some of the residents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002i3b77lw85vfj2@published"&gt;Well, the inevitable happened. An unmonitored resident fell while I was leading a program. I felt awful. They couldn’t speak to answer questions, which made matters worse. English is also not their first language. I spent my entire day off ruminating on what happened and thinking about whether I should be working here. I never received a reply or feedback from my supervisor after I messaged them about what happened. Any advice? I know looking for another workplace is a great solution, but it took me a year to land this job.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002l3b770j610v2i@published"&gt;Congratulations on getting out of your terrible last job and finding this new one. The learning curve for any new job can be steep and unsettling. It’s natural to ruminate on work problems, especially at the start. Give yourself time to understand the workplace better, and give yourself grace to know you’re doing your best in an imperfect environment. Be patient with yourself and your co-workers as you learn this new job while still recovering from the trauma of the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="161" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xid002m3b77lrj77qfg@published"&gt;As a new hire, you’ll naturally have a lot of questions. Ask your supervisor for a check-in after your first few weeks. Don’t mention their lack of response to your message; your supervisor might have too many messages to monitor, and you don’t want to set them up to be defensive. Instead, say you want to make sure you understand your responsibilities and proper procedures. Among other things, you want to know how you can help protect the residents if they’re unaccompanied. (Avoid the word “babysitter,” which sounds disrespectful.) If their aides aren’t present, should you alert your supervisor? Or the aides’ supervisor? Go seek the aides out yourself? Or should you monitor residents when they’re participating in one of your programs? If this responsibility wasn’t in your job description, well, job descriptions are often incomplete, and you need to know what’s really expected of you before you make any decisions about whether to stay, go, or stay and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xif002n3b778yq5jume@published"&gt;If the residents aren’t being cared for properly, the problem could be a poor policy, imperfect enforcement of good policies, or a lack of awareness about the policies. In any of these cases, you might be noticing problems with your fresh eyes that long-time employees overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

Yaranov said he spends "a long time indoors," which can contribute to vitamin D deficiency. When he learned his levels were low, he added vitamin D to his list of daily supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is increasing globally. All stages of dementia are marked by declines in memory and executive function. Previous research has examined whether micronutrient levels may relate to cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Copper is an essential trace element that participates in neuronal energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and antioxidant regulation. Previous studies have proposed both protective and harmful roles for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/copper/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; in neurodegenerative disease, depending on its bioavailability and concentration in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural tissue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Association between dietary copper intake and cognitive function in American older adults," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-09280-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cross-sectional+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cross-sectional analysis&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the relationship between dietary copper consumption and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 2,420 participants aged 60 years or older was selected from the 2011–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All participants had complete data on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+intake/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary intake&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary copper intake was derived from two averaged 24-hour dietary recalls. Cognitive function was measured using four instruments: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), the immediate and delayed recall subtests of the CERAD protocol, and a composite Z score reflecting global cognition. Copper intake was stratified into quartiles.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Multivariate linear regression models were used to test associations. In the fully adjusted model, participants in the highest copper intake quartile (Q4, ≥1.44 mg/day) had higher scores than those in the lowest quartile (Q1, &amp;lt;0.76 mg/day): DSST (β=3.80, 95% CI 1.90, 5.70), AFT (β=1.23, 95% CI 0.48, 1.99), CERAD-DRT (β=0.47, 95% CI 0.15, 0.80), and Z score (β=0.20, 95% CI 0.10, 0.29). No statistically significant association with CERAD-IRT was found in the fully adjusted model (β=0.58, 95% CI −0.06, 1.22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the higher copper intake quartiles were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic white, married, and higher income, with lower smoking prevalence and more favorable nutritional profiles, including higher intake of zinc, iron, selenium, and total energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spline-based regression modeling showed an inverted L-shaped association between copper intake and DSST, AFT, and Z score. Cognitive test performance improved with copper intake up to thresholds of 1.63 mg/day (DSST), 1.42 mg/day (AFT), and 1.22 mg/day (Z score).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these thresholds, associations with DSST, AFT, and Z score lost statistical significance, showing near zero change and wide confidence intervals..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with a history of stroke showed a stronger association between copper intake and global cognition. In this subgroup, Q4 intake was associated with a higher Z score than Q1 (β=0.55, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86; p for interaction=0.009). No significant interaction effects were observed for other demographic or clinical variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that copper intake was associated with better cognitive function test scores in older adults. Associations were strongest at moderate intake levels and most pronounced in individuals with prior stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the precise mechanisms underlying the relationship between dietary copper intake and cognitive function remain unknown, the authors state that the findings "… are considered biologically plausible. Dietary copper is crucial for brain health and may confer protective effects on cognitive function through its involvement in antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter synthesis, and energy metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;

He’s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn’t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f13e9b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06fcbd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76da3c" class="body-graf"&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c2628" class="body-graf"&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a759e8" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7f320" class="body-graf"&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af4654" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41b0b" class="body-graf"&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd465b" class="body-graf"&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" target="_blank"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d63eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b56e5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035921" class="body-graf"&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-052e01" class="body-graf"&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-205a8a" class="body-graf"&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-262dd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b4c4c" class="body-graf"&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6b370" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739ffb" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" target="_blank"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

The results are even more surprising. Researchers have discovered that gut bacteria produce a molecule that not only induces but also causes atherosclerosis, the accumulation of fat and cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This unexpected link between microbes and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-11/three-minutes-of-intense-exercise-a-day-can-improve-cardiovascular-health-in-sedentary-women.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-11/three-minutes-of-intense-exercise-a-day-can-improve-cardiovascular-health-in-sedentary-women.html"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; — the leading cause of death in humanity — is a paradigm shift. The work was published Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09263-w" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09263-w"&gt;in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a showcase for the world’s best science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The in-depth study of Santander employees using advanced medical imaging equipment soon revealed another shocking finding: atherosclerosis was ubiquitous. The volunteers were apparently healthy, aged between 40 and 55, but 63% of the participants showed signs of the disease. The new results show that some gut bacteria, in certain states, produce imidazole propionate, a simple molecule with six carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, two nitrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms (C₆H₈N₂O₂). This compound enters the blood, interacts with immature white blood cells, and triggers an inflammatory reaction in the arteries, which promotes the buildup of fatty plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Imidazole propionate induces atherosclerosis on its own. There’s a causal relationship,” asserts the biologist David Sancho, 53, leader of the new study at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Madrid. His team administered the molecule to mice, which developed the disease. Furthermore, scientists observed elevated levels of imidazole propionate in one out of every five volunteers with active atherosclerosis, the type in which fatty plaques are more likely to rupture and form the blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. The new results demonstrate that atherosclerosis is not only a disease caused by fat, but that it also has an inflammatory &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-02/from-the-wheelchair-to-the-bicycle-car-ts-achieve-spectacular-remissions-against-autoimmune-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-02/from-the-wheelchair-to-the-bicycle-car-ts-achieve-spectacular-remissions-against-autoimmune-diseases.html"&gt;and autoimmune component&lt;/a&gt;, according to Sancho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aorta arteries from a healthy mouse (left), another exposed to imidazole propionate (center), and another treated with propionate and an inhibitor drug, with red staining of atherosclerotic plaque." decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aorta arteries from a healthy mouse (left), another exposed to imidazole propionate (center), and another treated with propionate and an inhibitor drug, with red staining of atherosclerotic plaque.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;CNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The good news is that if C₆H₈N₂O₂ causes the problem in a significant percentage of patients, steps can be taken to prevent it. Researchers have identified the receptor to which the molecule binds and have managed to block it with a drug, reducing the progression of atherosclerosis in mice fed a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-20/is-a-cholesterol-level-over-200-a-death-sentence-antiquated-ideas-about-cholesterol-and-food.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-20/is-a-cholesterol-level-over-200-a-death-sentence-antiquated-ideas-about-cholesterol-and-food.html"&gt;high-cholesterol diet&lt;/a&gt;. “With this inhibitor, we completely prevented the development of the disease,” says Sancho, who has patented the experimental treatment with other co-authors, such as the Italian pharmacologist Annalaura Mastrangelo, their colleague Iñaki Robles, and the cardiologist Valentín Fuster, director general of the CNIC in Madrid and president of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York, which has borne his name for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Another of the study’s authors, the Swedish biologist Fredrik Bäckhed, had already discovered in 2018 that imidazole propionate levels were higher in people &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-03/what-to-eat-to-prevent-and-control-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-03/what-to-eat-to-prevent-and-control-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/a&gt; And just three months ago, independent research led by the cardiologist Arash Haghikia advanced the link between the bacterial molecule and atherosclerosis. “The fact that two different groups came to the same conclusion strengthens our confidence that this is a significant and relevant discovery,” argues Haghikia, of Ruhr University Bochum (Germany). “What is particularly striking is that imidazole propionate appears to promote atherosclerosis even when cholesterol levels are normal. This could help explain why some people develop heart disease despite having few or no traditional risk factors, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Left to right: the biologist David Sancho and the pharmacologists Annalaura Mastrangelo and Iñaki Robles, at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid." decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" class="icon_multimedia_ampliar | _pa a_m_i a_m_i-a _dn" viewbox="0 0 40 40"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Left to right: the biologist David Sancho and the pharmacologists Annalaura Mastrangelo and Iñaki Robles, at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;CNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year. Banco Santander’s chairman, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/10/inenglish/1410337590_990302.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/10/inenglish/1410337590_990302.html"&gt;Emilio Botín, died of a heart attack&lt;/a&gt; four years after signing off on the project, which has allowed for the analysis of more than 4,000 volunteer workers, 400 of whom are included in this new study. The research, conducted using expensive and complex techniques such as computed axial tomography (CAT) and positron emission tomography (PET), has made it possible to detect high levels of imidazole propionate in the very early stages of atherosclerosis, which could greatly facilitate diagnosis at that invisible stage when a person is unknowingly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Sancho and his colleagues acknowledge that further research will be needed to identify the specific strains of bacteria capable of producing the molecule, but they point to “changes in intestinal microbial ecology” following dietary modifications, with an increase in bacterial genera such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Eubacterium&lt;/i&gt;. When Fuster presented the project in 2010, he noted how difficult it is to diagnose cardiovascular problems early and how simple it is to prevent them, with measures &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-08/tell-me-who-you-are-and-ill-tell-you-how-to-exercise-different-personalities-enjoy-different-workouts.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-08/tell-me-who-you-are-and-ill-tell-you-how-to-exercise-different-personalities-enjoy-different-workouts.html"&gt;such as exercising&lt;/a&gt;, following a healthy diet, and not smoking. The new study shows that blood levels of imidazole propionate are lower in people with diets rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, tea, and low-fat dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The Argentine microbiologist Federico Rey and Indian pathologist Vaibhav Vemuganti applaud the “exciting opportunities” that the new study opens for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In a commentary also published Wednesday in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, the two experts emphasize that exposure to imidazole propionate worsens plaque formation in the arteries of mice. “This effect occurs independently of changes in cholesterol levels, a surprising result given the central role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis,” note the two specialists, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “This discovery offers an interesting clue about a possible new factor involved in the origin of atherosclerosis. This is very relevant because, although lowering cholesterol — through drugs called statins, for example — can effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, a considerable proportion of people still experience adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions or strokes,” they warn. The CNIC itself said in a statement that the new study “could revolutionize” the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Sancho stresses that the work has been made possible thanks to the collaboration of thousands of volunteer employees of Banco Santander in Madrid, but also thanks to grants of €1 million from the “la Caixa” Foundation, €150,000 from the European Research Council and €100,000 from the State Research Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The discovery of the decisive effect of imidazole propionate on atherosclerosis takes place against a backdrop in which the scientific community is revealing the unknown role &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-01-21/tell-me-what-bacteria-live-in-your-gut-and-ill-tell-you-who-your-friends-are.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-01-21/tell-me-what-bacteria-live-in-your-gut-and-ill-tell-you-who-your-friends-are.html"&gt;of intestinal microbes&lt;/a&gt; in some human diseases. The biotechnologist Cayetano Pleguezuelos and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute (The Netherlands) demonstrated in February 2020 that a strain of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; produces a toxic molecule, called colibactin, which damages the DNA of human cells and causes malignant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Cases of colorectal cancer are skyrocketing in people under the age of 50, due to unknown causes, doubling in many countries in the last two decades. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt;, led by computational biologist Marcos Díaz Gay, suggested just three months ago that behind this colorectal cancer epidemic is the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; toxin. “In young patients, up to 39 years of age, we see that colibactin pattern in one out of every three cases,” stressed Díaz Gay, of the National Cancer Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:50:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>科学家表示，三人试管婴儿技术使儿童免受遗传性疾病的影响-路透社 | Three-person IVF technique spared children from inherited diseases, scientists say - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOdU1HLUpsdjR4S2xsNER5amNvWXliNGVDb3BlU3dJSGpHdGhLVnFCcUFsMHRHSk15R1JXN3Q4R05OZEZQdVRqbVplQ1Mycmt6VHo5U2VKVTBkbmdjajFVSE9YVXpEV2NZazR6NVBmWDA3RnF3TllYVVVmYjZGaGVvYlJFNWNHSmhLeVJOM1ljbkNEcFh6ZU15YkhWZG9MZzdJeldOcnhLTU14STFhUFYxa3Y4VkpoV1d6T212WkE0NmdaNzlkeTZVZGcwQVBldXFiSWZwUUlleTM1dk5vX1lVWXhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 07:31:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOdU1HLUpsdjR4S2xsNER5amNvWXliNGVDb3BlU3dJSGpHdGhLVnFCcUFsMHRHSk15R1JXN3Q4R05OZEZQdVRqbVplQ1Mycmt6VHo5U2VKVTBkbmdjajFVSE9YVXpEV2NZazR6NVBmWDA3RnF3TllYVVVmYjZGaGVvYlJFNWNHSmhLeVJOM1ljbkNEcFh6ZU15YkhWZG9MZzdJeldOcnhLTU14STFhUFYxa3Y4VkpoV1d6T212WkE0NmdaNzlkeTZVZGcwQVBldXFiSWZwUUlleTM1dk5vX1lVWXhB</guid></item><item><title>随着疫苗接种率减半，苏丹儿童面临越来越大的致命传染病威胁--《卫报》 | Sudan’s children face growing threat of deadly infectious diseases as vaccination rates halve - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxOdTVMRm9HaHNEOVFvLWRUUTBVMUYwOWdtZnU4WVpMeHgtWFU5SmVBdlhWczZ5a25NclNQTlpCUlo5ejNyUTNqWG9ZR0QwcmdZeDRaLU95UFVUb0FKNE1BN0otZV9qb1lJcDczbjF1UDI4WHBvVDFIVXRMN3RjQ3hSOUg3bld2VWxLSTM5bkdTajNPaUdDYmlUbFN3LVcteG1oRHR4NEZySWVIbDlaWEpKekJDUmZOSVpVRE8ydnNJOXhnbXIzYUhHaXR6enVITFg2M2NuUXR5dWhYOXFvN0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children in Sudan, caught up in what aid organisations have called &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/sudan-in-worlds-largest-humanitarian-crisis-after-two-years-of-civil-war" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the world’s largest humanitarian crisis&lt;/a&gt; and threatened by rising levels of violence, are increasingly vulnerable to deadly infectious diseases as vaccinations in the country plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2022, more than 90% of young children in Sudan received their routine vaccinations.

Missing it, Hailegebriel said, meant a “child, and most probably also their parents, have almost zero contact with the health system”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She said the war had hit Sudan’s health service hard, with people displaced and the physical destruction of health facilities, supply lines and information systems “that makes the health service functional”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Health workers – doctors, nurses, midwives, community volunteers – have not been paid in months. And just the basic infrastructure – the clean water available to health facilities, the electricity availability to health facilities – is totally destroyed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Disease outbreaks in Sudan tend to affect people who have “lost your safe place, your home, your protection, however modest that might be”, and find themselves in camps or temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When that is coupled with an already vulnerable child who is not vaccinated, the vulnerability is compounded,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diseases that can be prevented with vaccination, &lt;a href="https://www.msf.org/children-darfur-sudan-urgently-need-immunisation-measles-spreads" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;including measles&lt;/a&gt;, not only kill but can leave survivors with long-term complications, Hailegebriel said, adding that these were “children who are robbed of their future”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c7fd21c4-c605-4d76-9027-401836b87c03" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A measles jab is given by a Médecins Sans Frontières nurse in Jebel Marra.

It opens the door to deadly disease outbreaks and puts even more pressure on health systems that are already stretched,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And while access to vaccination remains the main issue worldwide, “we’re extremely concerned about mis- and disinformation because of the threat it has to worsen the situation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="42429190-609d-4993-bc5e-9300eaad5bd0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A vaccination centre in Kassala state in July.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Mohammed Abdulmajid/Unicef&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;O’Brien said she expected cuts to aid funding to affect vaccine coverage in future years, with countries struggling to raise domestic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Humanitarian efforts had succeeded in boosting vaccination rates in the first half of this year in Sudan, said Hailegebriel, but Unicef’s appeal for the country remained unfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The charity has shipped in containers to rebuild the country’s “&lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/what-cold-chain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cold chain&lt;/a&gt;”, vital for keeping vaccines and other essential medicines at the right temperature so they remain effective on the journey from factory to patient.

And while carbs aren’t the enemy, some foods carry a reputation for being high in carbs—even when they’re not. Whether you’re paying closer attention to your carb intake for health reasons or are simply curious about what’s in your food, it can be helpful to know that some foods are lower in carbs than you might expect.

For instance, while potatoes and pasta are high in carbs, they also contain other nutrients that benefit your health, setting them apart from less nutritious high-carb foods like ice cream and cookies.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Due to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sweetness&lt;/a&gt;, carrots “get unfairly labeled as too sugary, but a cup [raw] only has around 12 grams of carbs,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s only 4% of the Daily Value for carbohydrates, which is 275 grams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, they’re packed with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant that helps fight inflammation and may lower the risk of chronic disease like type 2 diabetes, notes Simpson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Popcorn might surprise, since many popular snack options tend to be pretty high in carbs. Unlike many other snacks, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287900/is-popcorn-good-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;popcorn is low in carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and high in fiber. A 3-cup serving has only 15 grams of carbs and up to 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “That’s double the fiber than a handful of potato chips for the same carbohydrates,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber in popcorn helps slow down digestion and prevent a post-snack spike in blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-green-peas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Green Peas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While peas are sometimes grouped with higher-carb foods, they deserve a closer look. “A lot of people avoid peas because they think they’re super starchy, but a half cup only has about 12 grams of carbs,” says Simpson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s much less than other legumes. For instance, black beans have nearly twice that—around 21 grams of carbs in the same serving size.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll also get 4 grams of fiber, plus &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; and nutrients like vitamin K and magnesium, both of which support heart and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fruit contains natural sugars, but that doesn’t mean it’s off-limits or necessarily packed with carbs. For example,  a cup of diced watermelon delivers just 11 grams of carbs and plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and lycopene—two potent antioxidants that may help protect you against chronic disease, including heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, watermelon is also about 90% water, making it hydrating and refreshing on hot days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like other foods, dairy products are a natural source of carbohydrates. And they contain lactose, a natural sugar, but that doesn’t mean they are all high in carbs. Cottage cheese is a standout, with only 6 grams of carbs per half-cup and nearly 12 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  “It’s great for blood sugar balance and keeps you full—plus, you can go sweet or savory with it,” says Simpson.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to foods high in carbs, most people will include corn on their list. “While mature corn [like corn on the cob] contains a modest amount of carbohydrates, baby corn has much less,” says &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, BASc, MAN&lt;/a&gt;. An ear of corn provides 10 grams of carbs, whereas a half-cup of baby corn has just 4 grams of carbs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-edamame"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Edamame &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike most beans, such as pinto and black, edamame (young soybeans) are significantly lower in this nutrient. A half-cup contains just 7 grams of carbs, plus 9 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its fiber-protein combo helps stabilize blood sugar and promote satiety.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These nutrient-rich foods are easy to include in everyday meals. Here are a few ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go Meatless More Often:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be afraid of the carbs in beans&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;They provide a combination of protein and fiber that can help stabilize blood sugar levels&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Use fiber- and protein-rich edamame and green peas as the star of meatless meals. For instance, toss edamame into grain bowls or salads or add green peas to risottos, pastas or quick veggie soups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack Smart: &lt;/strong&gt;Many packaged snacks can be high in carbs and added sugars, but options like cottage cheese, raspberries or popcorn can satisfy without causing blood sugar spikes. While you can snack on them on their own, you can also get creative. Top cottage cheese with raspberries and chopped walnuts. Add a pinch of chili powder or cinnamon to flavor your popcorn. Or blend raspberries into smoothies or freeze them into yogurt barks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade Your Stir-Fries: &lt;/strong&gt;Vegetables like carrots and baby corn add crunch and vibrant color to any stir-fry, without a ton of carbs. Use carrot ribbons in place of noodles or stir-fry rounds with broccoli and tofu. Baby corn pairs well with mushrooms, peppers, and a light soy-ginger sauce. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need to fear carbs—especially when they come packaged with fiber, protein and beneficial nutrients. Some foods that are often assumed to be high in carbohydrates actually have less than they appear to have. Rather than cutting out entire food groups, focus on choosing nutrient-dense ingredients that help you feel your best. These eight foods are a great place to start: they’re satisfying, versatile and far more blood sugar-friendly than their reputations suggest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So go ahead—enjoy that popcorn, toss some peas into your stir-fry or scoop up cottage cheese with your favorite toppings.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROCHESTER, Minn. — We often hear how AI is impacting jobs and industries, and not always in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's a story about how artificial intelligence is helping the medical world in ways that we likely never imagined. It is changing lives, just ask Joanie and Dave Kraus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything is possible, and she’s definitely got a second chance at life,” says Dave.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave is talking about their daughter Jorie. The Krauses spent a long time trying to get pregnant and ultimately were able to conceive Jorie through IVF. They thought they had cleared the hurdle. Getting pregnant was the hard part, right? The couple thought health issues were in the clear as genetic testing was done as part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At our 20-week scan, they found out that she was a little bit small and they found an undefined heart issue. They didn't quite know what it was, and so we prayed for wisdom, and we went to Mayo for a second opinion,” says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanie, we should note, was a long-time KARE 11 employee, managing our sales department until recently.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 33 weeks, the doctors at Mayo decided a cesarean section (C-section) was the best option, and Jorie Kraus was welcomed into the world.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They immediately ended up putting her into one of those incubator things and shipped her off over to St. Mary's campus where I met her over there and Joanie stayed at the Mayo side of the campus and I had both women in my life in two different buildings and trying to split time with both and keep them both ok,” Dave recalls.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorie went on to spend 73 days in the NICU. It turned out she had not one but five heart issues, among some other physical anomalies, but nothing that couldn't be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How are we going to fix it, and how are we going to address it? And this wonderful surgeon said, 'Hey, don't worry about it. We're going to figure this all out. You just need to worry about who she's taking to prom,'" says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanie and Dave allowed themselves to exhale. But it's not where their baby girl's story ends. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing came back showing a problem. Jorie was missing part of her chromosome 10. A spontaneous deletion during pregnancy, meaning it was not inherited from either parent, which is why it wasn't caught during the IVF process. Jorie was diagnosed with DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that was the cause of her physical issues but would also cause low muscle tone, developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. At the time, just a couple dozen people in the world had the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Joanie was asking a little bit about what does that mean? And I just sort of piped up and said, 'That means it's permanent. There's nothing with this one. This one doesn't have a fix. This one doesn't have a surgery,' and that's when I had to get up and leave the room," Dave said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no cure, early interventions, like physical and speech therapies, were the only options. A year passed, and as Jorie fell behind with her milestones like crawling and talking, Joanie and Dave pushed forward, fighting for answers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're at the best hospital in the world. Where's the groundbreaking genetic research? And she had this big smile. This big, big smile and she goes, 'Have you met Dr. Whitney Thompson?'”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had, in fact, met Dr. Thompson. She was working in the NICU when they ordered the genetic testing or rapid genome sequencing for Jorie right after birth. And since that time, Thompson had started a new project with Dr. Laura Lambert called BabyForce.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can send this comprehensive genetic test Day One in the NICU and get a diagnosis within that first week of life, and it can really make a huge difference for patients, but often we get the diagnosis, but we don't have a treatment, and that's really where Babyforce comes in," says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors take a patient's skin cells and grow them in a lab. Using Artificial intelligence, they search for already FDA-approved drugs that could potentially help. Then they test them on the patient's lab-grown cells to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taking a drug that is already approved, and already known to be safe, and known to have a safety profile in children, really circumvents all of those issues that the rare disease population faces. So, we don't have to have that major investment into running a clinical trial because it's off-label use,” says Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jorie, the top hit from AI was an inexpensive drug commonly used to treat seizures in children. In the lab, it worked like a charm, boosting the levels of her working chromosome to compensate for the deleted one. Since the concept is so new, they had to go through ethics and legal departments first. Jorie just started taking the medicine a few months ago. Turns out, it is working like a charm in real life, too.  Within days, Jorie started walking with a walker, going up and down stairs, and even starting to say words.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like she was getting the information and understanding it but just couldn't figure out what to do with it, and now she's starting to figure out what to do with it,” says Joanie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A treatment for an ultra-rare disease would normally take years—if at all. The success in Jorie's case opens a door of hope for others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're focused on the NICU because, certainly, the earlier we intervene, potentially the more impact we can have on somebody's life, and the hope is we can move that timeline up even more, and start treating before symptoms even develop," says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know this could benefit patients who are born with genetic differences, but it also has applications for cancer, for example, where we could sequence an individual's tumor and understand what's causing the cancer and look for drugs using AI to try to have an impact for those patients as well,” adds Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endless possibilities. Which is also what these doctors have given Jorie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"She's going to be the best Jorie she can be. The barriers have been lifted for her," says Dave. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“She's just such a joy, and you know, we just hope that out of all of the hardship that we went through and all that she has gone through, that it will be a beacon of hope to others,” says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s the reason they are sharing their story, to pay it forward. None of this process was covered by insurance. It was all funding from Mayo and private donors. The Krauses have started both a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-jorie-effect-hope-for-rare-diseases"&gt;GoFundme&lt;/a&gt; and a charity called &lt;a href="https://www.thejorieeffect.com/"&gt;The Jorie Effect&lt;/a&gt; to help other children with rare diseases have access to this kind of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson and Lambert have already presented their findings at several medical gatherings and will publish their work and findings at the end of July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A drug widely used to treat nerve pain and epilepsy has been linked with an increase in cases of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Arizona State University, and the MetroHealth Medical Center in the US crunched the numbers on 26,416 records of patients with chronic &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-exercise-is-an-overlooked-solution-to-lower-back-pain"&gt;lower back pain&lt;/a&gt;, looking at the relationship between prescriptions for the anticonvulsant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"&gt;gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; and dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having six or more gabapentin prescriptions was linked to a significant increase in dementia risk and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), the data showed: those in that group were 29 percent and 85 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and MCI respectively, within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase was higher among patients aged between 35 and 49, and also rose with the number of prescriptions given, the researchers found. Though the study can't establish a cause for the increase, physicians are encouraged to keep a close eye on patients taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gabapentin prescription in adults with chronic low back pain is associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, particularly in non-elderly adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Physicians should monitor cognitive outcomes in patients prescribed gabapentin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold under brand names including Neurontin, gabapentin has proved to be less addictive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/opioids-watched-in-real-time-as-they-work-deep-inside-the-brain"&gt;than opioids&lt;/a&gt;, making it more likely to be prescribed in recent years. The drug does have some known side effects though, including extreme moods and allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have examined associations between gabapentin and dementia, but previous studies &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.031"&gt;haven't agreed&lt;/a&gt; on whether or not concerns are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg" alt="Gabapentin tablets" class="wp-image-167804 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gabapentin is a commonly prescribed medication for pain relief and epilepsy.

A study published in 1997 found no link between gabapentin and cognitive decline in people with epilepsy, so it's important to continue to widen the data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conflicting results could suggest unique mechanisms among patients with the type of backpain that leads to a gabapentin prescription that also increases their risk of dementia, like a certain type of location of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gabapentin works by dampening some of the brain's key communication channels, in order to provide relief from pain or make seizures less likely. So the worry is that it could also be damaging links between neurons in ways that might lead to dementia – a concern backed up by this latest study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a challenging condition to study with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-risk-can-be-cut-by-45-if-together-we-do-these-14-things"&gt;so many potential factors&lt;/a&gt; to account for, but each study gets us closer to the full picture of how the brain breaks down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the current study promotes further research to delineate whether gabapentin plays a causal role in the development of dementia and the underlying mechanisms of this relationship," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, with as many &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/2249-4863.201153"&gt;as a third&lt;/a&gt; of adults reporting problems with it. A new study suggests four low-effort, low-cost types of exercise that could help ensure a more restful night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on 1,348 individuals from 22 separate randomized controlled trials were pulled together to look for associations between exercise types and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-reportedly-cured-73-of-insomniacs-with-a-simple-one-hour-treatment"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. All kinds of exercise were linked to less severe insomnia, but yoga, Tai Chi, walking, and jogging were found to be most helpful of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're all types of activity that are fairly easy to do and don't have to cost you anything, and could be options &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-could-be-multiple-kinds-of-insomnia-all-requiring-different-treatments"&gt;for insomnia sufferers&lt;/a&gt; to explore alongside other medical advice – even if direct cause and effect can't be shown, according to the researchers from institutions across China and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-to-100-these-four-habits-might-help-get-you-there?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Want to Live to 100? These Four Habits Might Help Get You There.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Specifically, yoga may increase sleep duration, Tai Chi may enhance sleep architecture with lasting benefits, and walking or jogging may alleviate daytime dysfunction," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights could inform personalized treatment approaches and guide the development of future clinical guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between more exercise and better sleep &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;is a well established one&lt;/a&gt;, and in that respect the study results aren't surprising. However, what's useful here is the detailed look at exercise types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168123" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart.jpg" alt="Sleep treatments" class="wp-image-168123 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart-610x415.jpg 610w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart-600x408.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168123" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed a range of potential treatments for insomnia. (Bu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ Evid. Based Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the reviewed trials weren't fully consistent in terms of their methods or durations, the researchers were able to compare the effects of exercise on insomnia against approaches such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT), massage, acupuncture, improving sleep hygiene, and doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tai Chi, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-health-benefits-of-tai-chi"&gt;described as&lt;/a&gt; 'meditation in motion' and originating from China, showed more long-term benefits than other approaches. It was associated with improved sleep quality, being able to get to sleep quicker, and 50 minutes more sleep time on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored some of the reasons why these links might exist. Walking and jogging increases energy expenditure and boosts the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, for example, while yoga is known for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-ancient-activity-is-rumored-to-boost-your-longevity-but-is-it-true"&gt;relaxing the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yoga has significantly affected subjective sleep quality, likely due to its focus on body awareness, controlled breathing and attentional training," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Neurophysiological evidence indicates that yoga may enhance GABAergic activity and inhibit amygdala hyperactivation, thereby alleviating anxiety and depressive symptoms that often impair sleep initiation and perception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, part of the concern around insomnia is that it can lead to so many other health issues as well: people who struggle to get enough shut-eye during the night tend to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-disturbances-linked-with-higher-dementia-risk-study-finds"&gt;more likely to develop dementia&lt;/a&gt;, for example – though that could be due to medications or other factors, as well as the insomnia itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to reduce the severity of insomnia could thus reduce the risk of other problems, as well as improving day-to-day quality of life – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-of-us-hit-snooze-but-what-is-it-actually-doing-to-us"&gt;waking up more refreshed&lt;/a&gt; and not dozing off during afternoon meetings, for instance. The findings here could be useful for both insomnia sufferers and health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings will offer valuable guidance for clinicians and help patients to choose the most appropriate exercise methods for managing their insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s true that you’re not alone if you’re struggling with chronic exhaustion, like &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/hershey/story/medical-minute-why-am-i-always-so-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;physical exhaustion, Dr. Katelynn Sheaffer&lt;/a&gt; suggests, there is a diverse range of culprits that could be keeping you in this unhealthy cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From sleep patterns to eating habits and even screen-time usage, several things keep people feeling tired in their daily lives, no matter what’s going on in their routines. Many of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired are representative of these causes, so if you’re struggling, consider addressing these random and unsuspecting items first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. A phone charger right next to the bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/things-youll-always-find-in-the-home-of-someone-constantly-tired-phone-charger.png" alt="Man with a phone charger on his nightstand sitting in the dark." title="phone charger nightstand things you'll always find in the home of someone who's constantly tired " class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Gorodenkoff | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charger on the nightstand, and more specifically, constant access to their phone right from bed, is one of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are chronically exhausted and fatigued throughout the day almost always wake up that way. Their sleep patterns aren’t great; they’re not getting enough sleep, and they wake up feeling drained and anxious. So, what’s the primary motivator behind this lack of quality and duration of sleep? Experts believe it’s their phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7010281/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study from PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, scrolling on your phone before bed every night keeps your brain in a state of constant arousal and stress, making it harder to fall asleep and more challenging to wake up feeling rested. Of course, it’s not always convenient to set an alarm on your phone and put it away from your bed, but doing so can forcefully cultivate time — both in the morning and at night — for your brain to settle without added pressure from a phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/master-bedtime-habits-remain-happy-into-old-age"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts Say If You Can Master These 12 Pre-Bedtime Habits, You'll Remain Happy Into Your 80s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Water bottles next to a bed are a common sight in the homes of people who are constantly tired, as they often drink so much water that they wake up at night and disrupt their sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem unsuspecting, but the more intentional you are with food and water consumption before bed, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/wild-sleep-facts-explain-why-youre-still-tired-no-matter-what"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Wild Sleep Facts That Explain Why You’re Still Tired No Matter What&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Not only do warmer temperatures when we’re trying to sleep make it harder to comfortably fall asleep, but they also often disrupt our body’s cooling mechanisms that allow us to stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why a warm bedroom or a thermostat set about 70 degrees Fahrenheit are some of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired. They’re not only getting bad quality sleep — being woken up and disrupted every hour — they’re also not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The One Habit Well-Rested People Use To Fall Asleep In Minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81f85b" class="body-graf"&gt;Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they've separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3173b6" class="body-graf"&gt;"These DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors," said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2b655c" class="body-heading"&gt;How hearts are saved for donation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a30fb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca0f4f" class="body-graf"&gt;Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn't ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-943528" class="body-graf"&gt;To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor's abdominal and chest organs — after clamping off access to the brain. But it's ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1829aa" class="body-graf"&gt;Another option is to "reanimate" DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke's Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can't be used for young children's small hearts — the age group with the most dire need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-619ae5" class="body-heading"&gt;New ways of preserving hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5512a" class="body-graf"&gt;Turek's team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function — not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cd2d8" class="body-graf"&gt;They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate — and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn't allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek's team test the experimental alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe0b09" class="body-graf"&gt;It took just five minutes to tell "the coronary arteries are filling well, it's pink, it's beating," Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9336a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Vanderbilt's system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor's body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43243a" class="body-graf"&gt;That "replenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport," Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. "Our view is you don't necessarily need to reanimate the heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-f8f1d3" class="body-heading"&gt;More donated hearts are needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-842207" class="body-graf"&gt;There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ce34a" class="body-graf"&gt;Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a84dc0" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation's deceased donors — but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d327d" class="body-graf"&gt;That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial.

Irregular heart rhythms, or blocked arteries cause this symptom which many people may overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These signs during your 30s might seem unconnected to heart disease, but it is important to get yourself checked out, especially if you have High BP, Diabetes, smoke, are obese, or have a family history of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian Heart Institute – Silent Heart Attack Signs, 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cleveland Clinic – Silent Heart Attack Signs &amp;amp; Recovery, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mayo Clinic – Heart Attack Symptoms, 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johns Hopkins Medicine – Heart Attacks in Younger Adults, 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for medical advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQblN6d0hfZ1J1cG5HRHo3MlJndHhNWWdoOHU1VVRyb09ydnNWU2FDc3BaWnI0V2hkaTlYU241dDJWUlBIRXRUNE4wTFJJV1BmYlRKTEFGUFUybF8wQlQxUm5ENmlUSmZKZHdnU0pJLXVJRVMxNzRXZWVJTkdrRlEyeEw5Z0xPazFFYmlnQlRXUzRNd1A3OWx6dnA1RjI0MGlhenVpWUt5V211UjBnNzdzM2Z1ZHozc01qVXMtcnEtemY3RndKX1BzeGFyTVB6c2V1cVBfTnVGNk9sdw</guid></item><item><title>鸡蛋对心脏有害吗？法国科学家提供令人信服的启示--《印度时报》 | Are eggs bad for the heart?

Packed with protein, essential vitamins, and minerals, eggs are a nutritional powerhouse, but do they harm your heart? French biochemist Jessie Inchauspé, author of the bestselling books Glucose Revolution and The Glucose Goddess Method, has weighed in on whether eggs harm the heart. Inchauspé, who is known for her evidence-based approach to nutrition, has detailed the real impact of eggs on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eggs are a nutritional powerhouse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat 3 to 4 eggs a day... and I know what you're going to say: ‘Aren't eggs bad for your heart?’ So let's set the record straight: eggs are amazing!” she said, in a video shared on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are nutritious. An egg contains 78 calories, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single large boiled egg contains: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A: 8% of the DV (daily value)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Folate: 6% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5): 14% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B12: 23% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Riboflavin (vitamin B2): 20% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phosphorus: 7% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium: 28% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs also contain decent amounts of vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, calcium, and zinc&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Are eggs bad for the heart? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to associate eggs with heart disease due to their cholesterol content. According to the biochemist, the cholesterol in eggs does not pose a significant risk to cardiovascular health. “Cholesterol in eggs is not damaging,” she &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLh3H8eIQxm/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, adding that one does not have to be worried about eating eggs. “I have eggs every single day. There doesn't need to be a limit on how many eggs you consume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inchauspé notes that the culprit behind heart disease is not the eggs, but the glucose dysregulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So there are a few different hypotheses in the world of heart disease, but now things are starting to get a bit clearer. It's a two-factor approach. The first factor for heart disease is small, dense LDL particles of cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second factor for heart disease, inflammation and oxidation of particles in your bloodstream,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Eating an egg a day: Is it good or bad for your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What can be done &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/how-many-eggs-should-you-eat-per-day-latest-research-has-surprising-answers/articleshow/122331002.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have been looked upon with doubt due to their cholesterol content. However, now the focus has shifted to managing blood sugar and reducing inflammation rather than avoiding cholesterol-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce heart disease risk, the scientist recommends cutting back on sugar intake. “So, how do we avoid having unhealthy fats in our blood, and how do we avoid oxidation? The first thing we need to do is reduce sugar because sugar and high insulin, and high glucose levels, and fructose in the body will make both of those things worse. It will prompt your liver to produce small particle LDL, and it'll oxidize particles in your bloodstream,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxPOGk0bGMtMjJQWE81bnk0VndRQ1R5TXg2cjVBLTZVUkFCbHJMaThkWTJMNjkwakNieUhpeXhPMXlnT0dhTFdSbDZudW5hd2NTd3NmS0Qxb3MwbzUyNXJCMndsbmRvcnBURHQzRkhxaVJVSllUTUp2M0FWbnFLYVBKYm5mR2MzR2JtUlhvTDgtYk81YnphN3I4WTZIdzBzaFNFX3RubVlXeWNSdWhmOFhmRUZPNFlHTnBDa1BqSFh0cFh0aTZHYUFSazFaalo3U3huNlQxeDZIZVh5OHd0UXlSanpFeG9rQmxQRW9QdjhDY2ZxWS1EYTd0SlNnWmo1NnE2T3c</guid></item><item><title>在科学家使用三个人的DNA来避免遗传疾病之后，在英国出生的健康婴儿- CNN | Healthy babies born in Britain after scientists used DNA from three people to avoid genetic disease - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBNMHg1dExla191NUN0Zi1HX2pLclp3YUNaSnJvMVoxNzJIbURmQkZ1ak5pdlFlWDJpRW13ckJmUDBMclNXWWpTQXhvQWVyOHp5NnAzenlXU2U3NlpkSHJ5bWJqaEZnaEhKZWlHTTBBem5NMzcwdTA40gF8QVVfeXFMUENSeG0tSUNkZi1kb0pqTDBzUVc1SWFDS3lUNlVJZFlqdERCd09WOXlXakJ2YXEzei02dVlndUhWQmJlY1BEeWw2d0V6YkV4LWhVemZYeGRLVERDLV96RENsVlV2OS1mWU9rYU52YVZqZnBnUUM4emd0QXRFdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00063b6nj1ud8a7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it’s that genetic material — some inherited from mom, some from dad — that makes us who we are. But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00073b6nbwmlg8dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00083b6nzv1d63kp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-genetic-babies-mitochondria-three-parent-6d826809d66a4474bc9dc455c475ad58" target="_blank"&gt;first babies&lt;/a&gt; had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00093b6n0za4hust@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000a3b6n0nhj9gly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using this method means the embryo has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-9f87d8bbf8cb46b5b811f984ac7bba4e" target="_blank"&gt;DNA from three people&lt;/a&gt; — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-parenting-relationships-69d7ed6e2c6b4072b0e3d036ecb939a3" target="_blank"&gt;2016 U.K. law change&lt;/a&gt; to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000b3b6nokpt794d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000c3b6nxgwt5h98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000d3b6nqgcil7gf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work “a triumph of scientific innovation,” and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000e3b6nrtqx45m5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000f3b6ne3c78ayi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor … you will have much more DNA from another person,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000g3b6n0qqhgkdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country’s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000h3b6n1d2n5b4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it’s impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000i3b6njfcoaipd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Currently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,” Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000j3b6npe34y2ff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000k3b6ne84bah9x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000l3b6nddz7r2e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000m3b6nw6km0s1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the diagnosis “turned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.” Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter’s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000n3b6nlg16vr8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s super exciting for families that don’t have much hope in their lives,” Curtis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Called DCD, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/heart-transplant-donation-shortage-047da7c0bc9935e98421ad64ec6506bd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:or donation after circulatory death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;or donation after circulatory death&lt;/a&gt;, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they’ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,” said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How hearts are saved for donation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn’t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor’s abdominal and chest organs — after clamping off access to the brain. But it’s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another option is to “reanimate” DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke’s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can’t be used for young children’s small hearts — the age group with the most dire need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;New ways of preserving hearts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turek’s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function — not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate — and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn’t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek’s team test the experimental alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It took just five minutes to tell “the coronary arteries are filling well, it’s pink, it’s beating,” Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vanderbilt’s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor’s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That “replenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,” Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. “Our view is you don’t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More donated hearts are needed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-organ-transplants-government-and-politics-308bfae0c70c3377d595b9a0a3a5a381" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:huge need;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;huge need&lt;/a&gt; for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation’s deceased donors — but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Innovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If alternatives pan out, “I absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The fertility regulator granted the first licence in 2017 to a fertility clinic at Newcastle University where doctors pioneered the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The four boys and four girls, including one set of identical twins, were born to seven women and have no signs of the mitochondrial diseases they were at risk of inheriting. One further pregnancy is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Doug Turnbull, who was part of the team that spent more than two decades developing the procedure, said the healthy births were reassuring for researchers and the families affected. “You are inevitably thinking it’s great for the patients and that is a relief,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Mary Herbert, another senior member of the team, said to have eight healthy babies from the procedure was “rewarding for all of us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vast majority of a human’s 20,000 genes are curled up in the nucleus of nearly every cell in the body. But the fluid surrounding the nucleus contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria that carry their own set of 37 genes. Mutations in these genes can impair or completely disable mitochondria with catastrophic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People inherit all their mitochondria from their biological mother. Mutations in the tiny battery-like structures can affect all the children a woman has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The first symptoms of mitochondrial disease tend to appear in early childhood as energy-hungry organs such as the brain, heart and muscles start to fail. Many affected children have developmental delays, require wheelchairs and die young. About one in 5,000 newborns are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondrial donation treatment, or MDT, aims to prevent children from inheriting mutated mitochondria. The procedure involves fertilising the mother’s egg with the father’s sperm and then transferring the genetic material from the nucleus into a fertilised healthy donor egg that has had its own nucleus removed. This creates a fertilised egg with a full set of chromosomes from the parents, but healthy mitochondria from the donor. The egg is then implanted into the womb to establish a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/vitro-gametogenesisexplainer/giv-32554fs4UJ2dngZD7/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"How mitochondrial donation therapy works","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"b4098f2c-6bd7-4d48-9618-33fbaf7d0d36","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="b4098f2c-6bd7-4d48-9618-33fbaf7d0d36" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="How mitochondrial donation therapy works" data-testid="interactive-element-How%20mitochondrial%20donation%20therapy%20works" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/vitro-gametogenesisexplainer/giv-32554fs4UJ2dngZD7/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;How mitochondrial donation therapy works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The first eight babies born to the procedure are described in &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415539" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503658" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. All eight were healthy at birth. One child developed a urinary infection that was treated, and another developed muscle jerks that resolved on their own. A third child developed high blood fat and a disturbance in their heart rhythm, which was also treated. The condition is thought to be related to a medical issue the mother had in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Genetic tests showed that the babies had no or low levels of mutant mitochondria, with some carried over from the mother during the procedure. While the levels are considered too low to cause disease, it suggests the procedure could still be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All the children are well and they’re continuing to meet their developmental milestones,” said Bobby McFarland, director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders at Newcastle hospitals NHS foundation trust. Five of the children are less than a year old, two are aged between one and two, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/09/first-uk-baby-with-dna-from-three-people-born-after-new-ivf-procedure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the other child is older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The mother of one of the girls said: “As parents, all we ever wanted was to give our child a healthy start in life. After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope – and then it gave us our baby … we’re overwhelmed with gratitude. Science gave us a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some women who carry the genetic disorders produce eggs with varying levels of faulty mitochondria. For them, a technique called pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) can be used to select eggs for IVF that have a very low chance of passing on a disease. Other women do not have this choice because all their eggs have high levels of mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Newcastle team said eight of 22 (36%) of women became pregnant after MDT and 16 of 39 (41%) of women became pregnant after PGT. It is unclear why the rates differed, but some mitochondrial mutations may have knock-on effects on fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Writing in an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2507753" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Robin Lovell-Badge, a principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the long road to this point had “no doubt been frustrating to women at risk of having children with mtDNA disease”, but praised the scientists’ cautious approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVnVDdmJUOGpyT0ZHenY1dnVXdHZxU3I3bjdSWHJzYUxRcV9iNjk1YW5KU1YtT3NFMjZRQi16VmNqZGhTZkpuVG4xUWI2dnRZTmRaN2dNVVNXVi1YT2tuOG92WklZd2lzNUJTUHlTeHFRd2pubXRydVV2Um9IMTJjQ0RfZ1NDck1aWFVjQVlha2NBaGx3VU8zRE44ZXJhdkp4RS1ZekhaT2FIWnpvZ292dg</guid></item><item><title>研究人员尝试了为移植保存更多心脏的新方法-美联社新闻 | Researchers try new ways of preserving more hearts for transplants - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPMzBRRkNBQ25NSUJkRlE5ejctMnZRLXBwZWxHTm9fbnVkRHNfY0tUSlp3azh1QVFEUHNLNzM0TWNkUDQ3LXFITWtUZDRtYUlnc3RHMmFiZWJDanlfU2o2TFJiZlBUcnF1MVpEREhFWEVpZC1uNDRvTkkwVFc4YUJkdVpCdndNakxzVEdudTlIaUwyYXhl?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPMzBRRkNBQ25NSUJkRlE5ejctMnZRLXBwZWxHTm9fbnVkRHNfY0tUSlp3azh1QVFEUHNLNzM0TWNkUDQ3LXFITWtUZDRtYUlnc3RHMmFiZWJDanlfU2o2TFJiZlBUcnF1MVpEREhFWEVpZC1uNDRvTkkwVFc4YUJkdVpCdndNakxzVEdudTlIaUwyYXhl</guid></item><item><title>波罗公园的镜头： 25年7月16日周-波罗公园24 | The Lens of Boro Park: Week 7/16/2025 - Boro Park 24</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9VUXpuV3ZaRnBNNjJkcXVtaUFHc2FreHdZMXFid2Z0R3lVOHlCX2Nja3hMazJSY0VHTWFGdWZsTkswX0V0ZzYzU0IwNG9iNnpFdTlNVXNlUmk4ZzE5T0hKeWhWYy13bUJhZEFKZFQzeHBzSVd6ZXpV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="popup-text"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Learning how to make Greek yogurt at home is simple with this easy recipe. Start by making homemade yogurt by heating milk, combining it with a little bit of already-cultured yogurt and letting it sit in a warm spot until the milk turns into yogurt. Making protein-rich Greek yogurt takes one step beyond regular yogurt: straining the yogurt to thicken it. You can add the leftover liquid—also known as whey—to smoothies, or you can use it in place of buttermilk in baking.
&lt;/p&gt;

Current US childhood vaccine coverage is 95%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies the team conducted in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/62/9/1111/1745278?login=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/2/285/5741633?login=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggested that the vaccines generate at least 30 years of immunity against the life-threatening infections, far beyond the current 10-year booster recommendations and previous recommendations for even more frequent boosters (eg, every 3 years in 1955). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, childhood vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria have achieved roughly 95% and 99.9% reductions in those diseases, similar to those of other routine pediatric vaccines such as measles (99.9%), mumps (97.6%), and rubella (99.9%), the researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed, as indicated by the incidence of disease falling to less than one case of tetanus per 10 million person-years and approximately one case of diphtheria per 1 billion person-years in the U.S. population," they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First author Mark Slifka, PhD, of Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, said in a university &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090984"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that childhood vaccination has ensured that diphtheria and tetanus are "incredibly rare" today. "In fact, you're 10 to 1,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be diagnosed with tetanus and diphtheria in the United States," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Closer alignment with WHO guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like the United States, France recommends tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccines for adults. But the United Kingdom hasn't recommended them for anyone older than 14 since the 1950s, except for pregnant women or for those with tetanus-prone wounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet the investigators found that the United Kingdom had a slightly lower rate of tetanus and diphtheria infection and that population immunity remained strong even through a 2022 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266723001755?pes=doc&amp;amp;utm_source=asm&amp;amp;getft_integrator=asm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of 73 imported diphtheria cases among immigrants seeking asylum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Remarkably, despite this proportionally large influx of imported diphtheria cases, there was no evidence of transmission reported among other asylum seekers who arrived by other routes or among staff or health care workers," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors caution that adult boosters should still be considered for emergency use in cases involving susceptible wounds, pregnant women, travelers to areas endemic for diphtheria, and anyone who didn't complete the childhood vaccine series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population," the researchers wrote, adding that the move would more closely align US recommendations with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which haven't recommended adult boosters against tetanus or diphtheria since 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This scent is strong enough for a canine nose to detect with remarkable accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery could open the door to faster, cheaper, and entirely non‑invasive screening for a condition that currently lacks an early diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together &lt;a href="https://www.medicaldetectiondogs.org.uk/"&gt;Medical Detection Dogs&lt;/a&gt; in Milton Keynes with scientists from the Universities of &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/%C3%B9"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several months, the charity’s trainers conditioned two retriever-type dogs to recognize the odor that clings to sebum. This oily substance, which our skin naturally produces, changes when &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (PD) is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-training-dogs-to-detect-disease"&gt;Training dogs to detect disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, the canines encountered more than 200 gauze swabs. Some were taken from recently &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-that-dogs-can-alert-humans-to-valley-fever-disease/"&gt;diagnosed patients&lt;/a&gt;, others from volunteers with no neurological illness, and a few from people living with different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pad was clipped to a stand. When a dog paused and pointed at a positive sample, the handler quietly clicked and offered a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final double-blind trial – where neither the dog handler nor the overseeing scientist knew which positions held a patient’s swab – the dogs showed sensitivity of up to 80 percent and specificity of up to 98 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they were also able to detect Parkinson’s in swabs from people with multiple health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scent-of-parkinson-s"&gt;The scent of Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dog noses are legendary, but &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; researchers turned to them for a very specific reason. Excess sebum and a change in body odor often precede the familiar motor symptoms – shaking, slowed movement, and rigid muscles – by years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Scottish nurse named Joy Milne famously noticed a musky shift in her husband’s scent long before his diagnosis. Her observation inspired scientists to hunt for molecular fingerprints in skin oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A laboratory method based on mass‑spectrometry is inching forward, yet requires expensive instruments and trained personnel. Canines offer a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are extremely proud to say that once again, dogs can very accurately detect disease,” said Claire Guest, CEO and Chief Scientific Officer at Medical Detection Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is currently no early test for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and symptoms may start up to 20 years before they become visible and persistent leading to a confirmed diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Timely diagnosis is key as subsequent treatment could slow down the progression of the disease, and reduce the intensity of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-detection-rates-that-rival-medical-tests"&gt;Detection rates that rival medical tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even seasoned neurologists can misclassify early Parkinson’s, and imaging scans or spinal fluid assays are costly. By contrast, the gold-coated sensitivity and specificity reported here exceed those of many existing point-of-care tests in medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying diagnostic biomarkers of PD – particularly those that may predict development or help diagnose disease earlier – is the subject of much ongoing research,” said lead author Nicola Rooney, an animal behavior specialist at the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rooney noted that the dogs in the study achieved high sensitivity and specificity and showed there is an olfactory signature distinct to patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sensitivity levels of 70 percent and 80 percent are well above chance, and I believe that dogs could help us develop a quick, noninvasive, and cost-effective method to identify patients with Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blinded-trials-confirm-the-results"&gt;Blinded trials confirm the results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guard against subconscious cues or handler bias, the researchers also presented every testing line in reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer kept track of which sample sat where, and only after the dog’s choice did researchers learn whether to dispense a treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rigorous protocol mirrors clinical trial standards and boosts confidence that the animals relied on smell alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-help-build-smell-sensors"&gt;Dogs help build smell sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs will never replace neurologists, but the findings give chemists a shortlist of volatile molecules to capture with sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds to the growing body of evidence showing that simple, noninvasive skin swabs can be used to diagnose Parkinson’s disease,” said Perdita Barran, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Barran’s lab is already dissecting the swab chemistry; the canine results confirm those molecules belong on the diagnostic radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-and-other-neurological-diseases"&gt;Dogs and other neurological diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and dog trainers are beginning to explore how these animals can detect other neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, and even conditions like migraines or autism-related sensory episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Alzheimer’s, for example, people in early stages of the disease may emit subtle changes in body odor – things a human nose would never catch, but a dog’s nose picks up with ease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scent cues could one day help in screening or early detection, well before symptoms become obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also stories of dogs acting differently before their owners have a migraine or during MS flare-ups – becoming restless or unusually attentive – as if they sense something’s coming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some families of children with autism even report that service dogs notice sensory overload before it escalates, helping calm things down before a meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-the-science-of-scent"&gt;Expanding the science of scent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials aim to include people with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-disruptions-could-signal-the-onset-of-alzheimers/"&gt;REM sleep behavior disorder&lt;/a&gt; – a risk state for Parkinson’s – to see whether dogs can spot the disease before a neurologist could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel chemical analyses will hunt for the exact compounds responsible for the odor. If those molecules prove consistent worldwide, engineers could embed them in low‑cost sensor chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now the message is hopeful: a straightforward skin swab carries hidden information about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-grounds-could-help-prevent-neurodegenerative-diseases/"&gt;neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, and a dog’s nose can read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That knowledge could accelerate the quest for a rapid, painless test. It would offer one more tool to bring Parkinson’s onto clinicians’ radar while there is still time to slow its march.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1877718X251342485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:46:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWlhtQ1c3UmMycFlFQVFEN3c0b2E3aFc4UzktS1dDc1RycEpzVk4zdlQzUkRMNHZzcXpISzRNelVHWlBocDFZZ0MyZHozcEFqN2dTU3dQRDU2SlZ2NW04WWs3TWFvVWZIa2NZZkw1YU5TNkJvNFZDLTFqRXZUTGt2ZmV1UTRFNUJuY2JZY1MyQmFjTWV3OUdWbE1qeWVyZEdjUVZMU1BldFozOHdnd1hV</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹疫情能否阻止？ - WIRED | Can US Measles Outbreaks Be Stopped? - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE03akhoOE55VFlQb001ektpMURnSXR6R3FvWnhVTG1EdVh1ZmM5QmVDQXNnZk5mcUNMRnpBUnVlTEVwY3NCbnl5QzU3QVRlSnZxX3dxY19mdGJmcHFzdmd4ZXg1N1c3ZzhWaTRHZVM3T2NNQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;The US is&lt;/span&gt; experiencing its worst &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-rising-other-diseases-could-follow/"&gt;year for measles&lt;/a&gt; in over three decades, with more than 1,300 cases in 40 states as of July 16. Cases were almost as high in 2019, putting the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; at risk. Six years ago, health officials were able to stop the spread. But amid growing public backlash against vaccines, many of the tactics used then may not work now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles elimination means there has been no continuous transmission in a country for longer than 12 months. That almost happened in the 2019 outbreak, which largely affected Orthodox Jewish populations in New York City and some surrounding counties. In fall 2018, US travelers returning from Israel tested positive for measles. The disease quickly spread throughout close-knit communities, especially among children, due to low vaccination rates. While the statewide measles vaccination rate for school-age children was 98 percent the previous school year, vaccination coverage in schools in the outbreak area &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a4.htm"&gt;was only 77 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Because measles is highly contagious, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9197781/"&gt;95 percent vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; is needed to protect a community from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As a result, the majority of measles cases occurred in individuals 18 and under, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;nearly 86 percent&lt;/a&gt; of whom were known to be unvaccinated. Some of those people developed severe complications, including pneumonia, and nearly 8 percent were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The current surge is being fueled by an outbreak that started in an undervaccinated Mennonite community in West Texas. Cases have since spread to other Texas counties, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Two children in Texas with no underlying conditions and one adult in New Mexico have died this year as a result of measles. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There are definitely parallels. What we saw in New York was very much the result of years and years of spread of misinformation and disinformation around the safety of vaccines,” says Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source Coalition and previously a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped respond to the 2019 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cases eventually burned out in New York after a months-long effort that included both traditional public health approaches and policy changes at the local and state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“You need to take the first case seriously, because it's like kindling. You never know when that fire is just going to break out,” says Oxiris Barbot, the current president and CEO of the United Hospital Fund, who served as New York City’s health commissioner from 2018 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As the disease spread, Barbot realized the city health department would need to go to the source of transmission, largely the Orthodox Jewish schools in affected neighborhoods. Working with school administrators, they reviewed vaccination records to identify unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children. Following an exposure, those children were prohibited from attending school and childcare for 21 days, the incubation period for measles. Similar measures were taken in some counties outside the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It took a lot of staff time, a lot of leg work,” Barbot says. In one school, a contagious child led to more than 25 infections in other students and further spread outside the school. She says the health department was “heavily involved” in making sure schools were abiding by the quarantine measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE03akhoOE55VFlQb001ektpMURnSXR6R3FvWnhVTG1EdVh1ZmM5QmVDQXNnZk5mcUNMRnpBUnVlTEVwY3NCbnl5QzU3QVRlSnZxX3dxY19mdGJmcHFzdmd4ZXg1N1c3ZzhWaTRHZVM3T2NNQQ</guid></item><item><title>西南卫生区又有1例麻疹诊断标志着犹他州有10例病例- KSL新闻 | 1 more measles diagnosis in southwest health district marks 10 cases in Utah - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZU5RUXlxUmZXUHZRMXl1N0pTWUdsdjg2bzFqelpyT3BZejI3V2hqemVHMlJ1UkQzTDF2cGRZb2RIbEZQMldHaDg0S05ORXl2eVlrQ0JMdHB4NUJuc0VYbFpTQzNVa2Y0dWRaLV9CQnJVQUxKM0s4YWQ3ZlNKcUM1QXI1ZlMxaWlPYnc1R0ZKZFg3aFNDaU9fNzFhV25NZ2lfQUl4ZnZvdTgyVWhINUE4dDlLSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Another case of measles has been diagnosed in Utah, bringing this year's state total to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest case involves an unvaccinated person residing within the Southwest Utah Public Health District, according to a press release issued by the Utah Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person reported self-isolating when they became sick, the release states, and the individual is already past the infectious period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 10 individuals who have been diagnosed with measles in Utah, at this point, are unvaccinated, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of them live in the Utah County Health Department.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6fg000o3b77kjcvhjta@published"&gt;I’m in a loving relationship with a woman I absolutely adore. We have sex two to three times a week, and it’s wonderful. But I’ve been using AI tools for masturbation nearly every day. It’s just so easy to explore wacky and fun scenarios (specifically in the fantasy and sci-fi genres) that I’ve found it dividing my attention from my girlfriend. I feel selfish and immature for not giving her all of my desire, and she’s told me she would like to have more sex. I really don’t know how to feel about this. Your perspective would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6k1000r3b77lew82vhr@published"&gt;I’m going to circumvent getting into the specific ethics of AI from an environmental/representational level because that’s not really what this column is about. Plus, you’re probably hearing about AI &lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/06/ai-chatgpt-generator-grok-gemini-writing.html"&gt;ethical concerns &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/07/ai-college-cheating-gemini-chatgpt-students-policy.html"&gt;everywhere these days&lt;/a&gt; (and if you’ve somehow missed the discourse, you &lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/artificial-intelligence"&gt;can get up to speed on Slate&lt;/a&gt;). I think AI’s only going to become more integrated in our culture, whether we like it or not. So I’m accepting it as a given and treating it here like garden-variety porn, as you’re using it as a masturbation aid and the content is basically immaterial, or at least not nearly as important as its role as said aid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6lg000s3b77b9g7b881@published"&gt;You are allowed to have a sexual life of your own. Masturbation is healthy and a great way of keeping in touch (literally!) with your own body and sexuality. It becomes problematic when it causes distress and/or is subtractive from your lifestyle. If you had written to say that all of your sexual energy is taken up by your masturbation and porn viewing, and that you and your partner don’t like this, it would be a different issue. However, you are enjoying it and managing to have sex two or three times a week, which is above average. If you were preoccupied by said porn/unable to focus on your partner, again, it would be a different issue, but it seems as though you have struck a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6qr000t3b773eda0byr@published"&gt;If you think that less masturbation would yield more sex, and you actually want that, then by all means, cut back. You don’t have to abstain. Instead of nearly every day, you could masturbate every other day and see if that increases your energy and desire for partnered sex. Maybe on the days that you are feeling less sexual with your partner, you show up for her anyway and make out with her while she masturbates, give her oral, finger her, use toys on her, or something of the like. Make the session about her, not you. Perhaps there’s some aspect about the fantasies and scenarios you feel comfortable exploring through AI that you can share with your wife, either by viewing/reading porn together or role-playing. But it sounds like you’re having a healthy amount of sex. It could be that you’re at your natural limit for partnered sex, and masturbation is simply not affecting it. Again, experiment. Go a week without masturbating and see if your sex drive for your partner increases. You may surprise yourself, or you might not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu2u002w3b7767jf1678@published"&gt;I’m a 26-year-old single gay man who has recently been dealing with mild &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355766"&gt;prostatitis&lt;/a&gt;, of which the only symptom that presents for me is hematospermia (blood in semen). It’s a very small amount of blood, but it means that the majority of my loads have a light pink or red tinge to them. I’m grateful that this is all I’m dealing with, as I’ve come to learn that prostatitis can present some serious, incredibly painful symptoms for people. From a medical point of view, I’m handling it. I’ve got a good urologist, am attending pelvic floor therapy, and am massaging my prostate regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu32002y3b77pzz8wpgz@published"&gt;But from a sexual point of view, I’m having a hard time. Cumming is not painful, I’m still horny, and my doc has assured me I should still ejaculate on a semi-regular schedule while I’m working to get this managed. But as a single guy who prefers low-key hookups, I’m struggling to figure out a way to finish with someone without having to explain the whole deal. And while I’ve become accustomed to it, I get that the sight of a red-tinged load of cum is not normal for someone (the first time I saw it myself, I actually fainted!) and isn’t a welcome surprise during climax. Unfortunately, I’m not into orgasm denial/chastity play, and getting off is an important part of a hookup for me if I’m going to have one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu33002z3b774gidhlod@published"&gt;From this, I’m left trying to figure out a way I could possibly hook up with someone (and finish) without them actually seeing my load. Should I make a big deal about being very turned on by cumming on a guy’s backside? Are there ways, both creative and ethical, that I could employ to enjoy some fun with a casual hookup that doesn’t require me to give them a spiel about why they’re seeing what they’re seeing? I’m vers, so I am open to pretty much any suggestion. I’m also on PrEP, vaccinated, and tested regularly—it’s just something about the presence of blood that makes me feel like nondisclosure here is more unethical, somehow. Any guidance is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu3500323b77lwddrnkc@published"&gt;Your concerns make sense and underscore a paradox of modern gay hook-up culture: We put ourselves in vulnerable positions again and again with strangers who don’t know (or sometimes don’t &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;) much about us, so they may feel free to dispense their judgment openly, which makes us that much more vulnerable. Your rosé loads could be received by partners with not so much as a shrug, just as easily as they could be regarded with suspicion or even mockery. For you, each shot load is a crapshoot. You could take this as an opportunity: Partners’ reactions will show you whether they’re worth keeping around. You’ll see what they’re made of by what they make of you, to &lt;a href="https://genius.com/Ani-difranco-willing-to-fight-lyrics"&gt;paraphrase Ani DiFranco&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that would mean enduring the bad feedback as well as the good, and it seems like you want to avoid the bad entirely, which is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd69vj6e005x3b77qd4om6jh@published"&gt;Given that hematospermia is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3921834/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;generally regarded as benign&lt;/a&gt; I don’t think you have too much to worry about in terms of the ethics of disclosure here. Sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-in-the-semen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it’s caused by an STI&lt;/a&gt; but you know for a fact that’s not the case here. If it is discovered by your partner, you would definitely want to explain that it’s not the product of an STI, but it makes sense that you want to fly under the radar with your pinkish sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu3600333b77zcgu2xuu@published"&gt;You could come inside of them, whether or not you use condoms. Burying your load is the best way to prevent your partner from seeing its color. Guys who want to be bred typically &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to be bred, so you are unlikely to arouse suspicion. A condom would be even easier to manage, as you can handle the disposal yourself—tie it up, throw it in the trash, and no one is the wiser. And yes, you can pull out and shoot on their backs as well—offer to towel them down yourself after, and, again, handle the disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

This is working out pretty well, all things considered, but we’re not ready for group play at the moment. My wife thinks that means that we can’t reach out to other couples who are looking to swap because her opinion is that a swap means group play with everyone in the same room. I think it’s more likely that you just swap partners in separate spaces. I know there’s no right or wrong answer here, but what’s the more common interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;

If you think about the way the greater culture of swinging and polyamory operates, swapping often takes place at parties/clubs, where the action is out in the open. Yes, some parties have private booths or sections where interested people can go for some one-on-one time, but the general vibe is all out in the open. That, of course, allows for people to scope out the action and potentially join. “Open” often has a multipurpose use when describing relationships—it is often taken as meaning not only that you are open to other partners, but open to a lot of different things that you can do with them.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64w276003l3b77gf8j4roj@published"&gt;But why leave anything up to assumptions? People have boundaries, and they are best stated upfront. Even if people would normally enter a situation with another couple with the expectation that you all play together (or at least in the same room), you can counter said assumptions by stating your limits and preferences. People will then use that information to determine whether or not they’re willing to hook up with you. There may be couples that you encounter who have a rule that they only play together (in the same room). There may be others who are a bit freer (which is to say: open) and will accept your stated parameters because they’re really into you and want you however they can get you. You can explain to them your reasons for wanting the configurations that you do (you’re new to this, moving slowly, and full-on group play is off the table for the time being) or not. Just be clear and let people respond in kind. You’ll be fine. Certainly, what you are asking for is not unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;

They have discovered this about themselves (or perhaps just been more open about it) the last year or so. I’m glad they are finding their truth, and I have tried to be supportive of them, helping them learn to do makeup, buying them nice heels and helping them pick out clothing, defending them to a few members of our families and other bigots. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/01/bisexual-lover-lost-interest-sex-advice.html"&gt;What’s really frustrating me, is lately, or the last year or so, they’ve made comments about lack of sex to our mutual friends and even around our families.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of these signs have a direct link to how active someone is, walking is a particularly effective way to help &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; improve their overall health and quality of life and maintain independence for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a common question remains: How fast should older adults walk to see real benefits? Traditionally, the "talk test" has been used to guide walking intensity: people are encouraged to walk at a pace that makes it difficult to sing but still allows for comfortable conversation. However, this method is subjective and difficult to apply consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine found that walking slightly faster—14 steps per minute more than a person's usual pace—led to meaningful improvements in physical function among older adults who were frail or at risk of becoming frail. "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank"&gt;Walking cadence as a measure of activity intensity and impact on functional capacity for prefrail and frail older adults&lt;/a&gt;," was published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, the researchers developed and tested a smartphone app designed to accurately measure walking pace, making it easier to integrate this beneficial practice into &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/daily+life/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;daily life&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;a href="https://karger.com/dib/article/doi/10.1159/000545982/928754/A-smartphone-application-to-measure-walking" target="_blank"&gt;A smartphone application to measure walking cadence before major abdominal surgery in older adults&lt;/a&gt;" was published in &lt;i&gt;Digital Biomarkers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Why study walking pace?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking cadence—the number of steps taken per minute—is an intuitive and pragmatic way to measure walking intensity. Daniel Rubin, MD, an anesthesiologist at UChicago Medicine, became interested in cadence because of his &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+experience/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical experience&lt;/a&gt; evaluating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older patients&lt;/a&gt; preparing for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Older adults have a high risk of complications associated with surgery," he said. "Traditionally, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/surgical+teams/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;surgical teams&lt;/a&gt; have relied on physical function questionnaires to risk stratify patients, but I thought there must be a way to develop more objective metrics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking faster is healthier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, Rubin and his colleagues studied older adults classified as frail or prefrail. Participants were enrolled in structured walking programs within their retirement communities, guided and assessed by clinical research staff, and cadence was measured by a device fitted to their thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was encouraged to walk "as fast as safely possible," while another group walked at their usual comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's results showed clear benefits: those who increased their cadence by at least 14 steps per minute above their usual pace (to roughly 100 steps per minute) experienced substantial improvements in their functional capacity, demonstrated by their ability to walk longer distances in a standardized test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People who haven't experienced frailty can't imagine how big a difference it makes to be able to not get tired going to the grocery store or not need to sit down while they're out," Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;An intuitive walking app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, Rubin's team created a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/smartphone+app/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smartphone app&lt;/a&gt; called "Walk Test," which they designed specifically for measuring walking cadence accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We didn't necessarily trust smartphones' built-in analytics," Rubin said. "Instead, we built an app that uses a novel open-source method to analyze the data measured by the phone and lets us actively engage users in brief, deliberate walking tests, ensuring accurate measurement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation testing showed that the app counts steps per minute with exceptional accuracy, closely matching specialized, research-grade accelerometers. Rubin noted that Walk Test was designed for accessibility and user-friendliness in addition to accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to make it as low-barrier as possible so it's easy for older adults to use without additional equipment," he said. "The people who need the most help are usually the least well-equipped to get started."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical advice for daily life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights walking as a widely accessible exercise with substantial health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even casual walking had positive effects on our study participants," Rubin said. But for those who are able, increasing their walking pace judiciously can yield even greater results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use cadence to guide your walking intensity, start by measuring your usual walking pace in steps per minute to establish a baseline. From there, try increasing your pace slightly to find a level that still feels comfortable but brisker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain a steady and elevated cadence, Rubin recommends using a metronome app to match your steps to a consistent beat. While the Walk Test app developed by the research team is not yet available to the public, metronome apps are a simple alternative that can help walkers stay on pace and track progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods can help integrate faster-paced walking into daily routines, offering a simple yet effective strategy to people who want to stay healthier and more independent as they age.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse experiences and environments in childhood&lt;/strong&gt; may cause a chain reaction of mental and physical health problems later in life, according to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40289919/"&gt;new University of Georgia research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_102393" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter.webp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-102393" class="wp-image-102393 size-medium" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-300x292.webp" alt="Environmental portrait of researcher Sierra Carter in an office in front of bookshelves" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-300x292.webp 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-768x747.webp 768w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-549x534.webp 549w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-810x788.webp 810w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter.webp 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-102393" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sierra Carter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests growing up with negative events and in dangerous communities in early adolescence can alter an entire lifetime, particularly for Black men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things that happen to you in childhood — from how you’re raised as a child to the environment that you’re in — can lead to long-standing issues,” said &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/a-new-associate-director-for-cfr/"&gt;Sierra Carter&lt;/a&gt;, co-author of the study and the new associate director of UGA’s &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/"&gt;Center for Family Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unfavorable environments, treatment in childhoods influence substance use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on data from the UGA-led &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/for-researchers/projects/fachs/"&gt;Family and Community Health Study&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1996, the ongoing study follows more than 800 families, all of which had a fifth grader at the start of the study. The researchers reinterview participants every two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study found starting at age 10, children were already able to register when their environments and treatment around them were unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsafe community environments affected not only the way the children acted but also created a physical, inflammatory response in their central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in young adulthood, these stressors on both body and mind translated to earlier and more frequent use of substances as a way of self-medicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found a lag with these background childhood experiences and drinking,” said &lt;a href="https://psychology.uga.edu/directory/people/steven-beach"&gt;Steven Beach&lt;/a&gt;, corresponding author of the study and director of the Center for Family Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once kids moved out of the protective environment of their homes, the delayed inflammatory responses had a chance to emerge and influence their behavior in a bigger way, setting the stage for elevated alcohol consumption.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol misuse causes lasting physical consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol over time created measurable health complications in adulthood for participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who reported drinking heavily as young adults were at higher risk of heart problems as they got older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, those 29-year-olds had worse aging outcomes as a result of this drinking, meaning there was a possibly shorter life expectancy, and faster signs of aging across numerous body systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect of alcohol on aging was especially pronounced for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous childhoods have disproportionate effect on Black men, women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of adverse childhoods were compounded for Black men and women, largely due to the added effects of discrimination in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being exposed to racial discrimination puts you at risk for early alcohol use, which then puts you at risk for later alcohol use and other diseases down the road,” Carter said. “That’s a well-established pathway that gets people on this difficult trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black participants who experienced racism in early life were more likely to binge drink and experience cardiac issues and faster aging in their appearance and body functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I firmly believe that we can do better than we currently are in terms of protecting children in a whole variety of ways,” Beach said. “It’s just really important for us to think about the delayed effects of childhood experiences that carry forward and have an impact on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study also underscores the likely payoff of investments in children and building strong, safe communities. If we can intervene early, if we can support kids, the payoffs are likely to not just be immediate. They’re likely to be very long lasting, all the way out through adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was published in Development and Psychopathology and was funded by the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse awarded and National Institute on Aging. Co-authors include the late Ron Simons, Regents Professor in the UGA Department of Sociology, who passed away in March.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;A scientific team supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a new, ultra-high-resolution brain imaging system that can reconstruct microscopic brain structures that are disrupted in neurological and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. The new system is a significant advance over conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners that cannot visualize these tiny but clinically important structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system, called the Connectome 2.0 human MRI scanner, overcomes a significant hurdle for neuroscientists: being able to bridge different brain regions and probe tiny structures necessary to define the “connectome,” the complex matrix of structural connections between nodes in the nervous system, and to do it noninvasively in living humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research is a transformative leap in brain imaging – pushing the boundaries of what we can see and understand about the living human brain at a cellular level,” said John Ngai, Ph.D., Director of NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “The new scanner lays essential groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/neuroimaging-technologies-across-scales/brain-initiative-connectivity-across-scales"&gt;BRAIN CONNECTS&lt;/a&gt; program’s ultimate goal of developing a wiring diagram for the human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanner is innovative in two major ways: it fits snugly around the heads of living people, and it has many more channels than typical MRI systems. These advances greatly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the system, providing much sharper images of very small biological brain structures than previously possible. These technical upgrades will enable scientists to map human brain fibers and cellular architecture down to nearly single-micron precision to study how subtle changes in cells and connections relate to cognition, behavior, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team showed that the scanner was safe in healthy research volunteers, revealing subtle microstructural differences (individual axon diameter or cell size) between individual brains. Before this new system, this was only feasible in postmortem or animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to build an imaging platform that could truly span scales – from cells to circuits,” said senior author Susie Huang, M.D., Ph.D., of the Department of Radiology at Mass General Hospital. “It provides researchers and clinicians with a powerful new tool to study brain architecture in health and disease, in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is an important step toward developing a complete wiring diagram of the brain, an achievement that requires novel approaches to map the brain at different scales: across large brain regions and circuits, as well as at the level of tiny cells and connections. It also opens the door for future advances in precision neuroscience, in which noninvasive brain stimulation may help treat brain disorders tailored to an individual’s unique brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded in part by The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. It supports the BRAIN Initiative Connectivity Across Scales (BRAIN CONNECTS) program, which aims to develop the research capacity and technical capabilities to generate wiring diagrams that can span entire brains across multiple scales. The findings were reported July 16 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These changes were especially pronounced during non-REM sleep and in younger adults, suggesting that age and sleep stage both influence how the brain responds to caffeine at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings shed light on how caffeine influences the brain’s internal rhythms beyond simply keeping people awake, offering new insights into its potential effects on sleep quality and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant in the world, commonly found in coffee, tea, soda, chocolate, and many medications. While its alerting effects are well known, scientists have yet to fully understand how caffeine alters brain activity during sleep—a time when the brain undergoes important restorative and regulatory processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study aimed to uncover how caffeine changes the structure and complexity of brain activity during different sleep stages. Researchers were particularly interested in whether caffeine affects the brain’s “criticality”—a theoretical balance between order and chaos believed to optimize information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work has shown that in waking states, higher brain complexity is associated with better cognitive functioning. But it remained unclear how caffeine might influence this complexity during sleep, when the brain’s dynamics naturally shift toward lower activity and more regular patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread use of caffeine among the public makes this topic an important health consideration. Understanding how caffeine affects sleep architecture and brain dynamics, as measured through EEG, can help clarify its impact on neural health,” said study author Philipp Thölke, a research trainee in the Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab) at the University of Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers analyzed the brain activity of 40 healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 58. Participants spent two separate nights in a sleep laboratory—one after ingesting 200 mg of caffeine (roughly equivalent to two cups of coffee) and one after ingesting a placebo. The study used a double-blind crossover design, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew which condition was administered on a given night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants were free of medical and psychiatric conditions, had moderate daily caffeine habits, and abstained from caffeine after noon on the days of testing. Their sleep was monitored using EEG, which records electrical signals from the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. The researchers divided sleep into two main categories for analysis: non-REM (which includes light and deep sleep) and REM (the stage associated with dreaming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team extracted a wide range of features from the EEG data, including both traditional frequency-based measures and more sophisticated metrics that capture the unpredictability and information content of the signal. They focused on several markers of brain complexity, including entropy (a measure of randomness), Lempel-Ziv complexity (which quantifies how compressible a signal is), and long-range temporal correlations (which assess how similar a signal is to itself over time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined the brain’s power spectrum—the distribution of electrical activity across different frequencies. This spectrum has two components: oscillatory rhythms, like the familiar delta and alpha waves, and an aperiodic background signal often referred to as “1/f noise.” The slope of this aperiodic signal is believed to reflect the balance between neural excitation and inhibition. A flatter slope is thought to indicate greater neural excitation and closer proximity to a “critical state,” where the brain is most responsive and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that caffeine produced widespread and consistent effects on brain complexity during non-REM sleep. Compared to placebo, caffeine increased several measures of entropy and complexity, and it reduced long-range temporal correlations. It also led to a flattening of the aperiodic slope in the power spectrum. Together, these findings suggest that caffeine shifts the sleeping brain toward a more excitable and dynamic regime, one that resembles the critical state associated with wakefulness and cognitive engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these changes were far more pronounced during non-REM sleep than during REM sleep. In REM, the effects of caffeine were smaller and more localized, mainly appearing in occipital (visual) regions. One measure—spectral entropy—stood out as the most effective at distinguishing caffeine from placebo in non-REM sleep, achieving a classification accuracy of 75% when used in machine learning models. This performance surpassed all traditional EEG measures of oscillatory power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine delays but does not prevent sleep, so even though we can sleep under the influence of caffeine, the brain and therefore also sleep is impacted by the drug,” Thölke told PsyPost. “It leads to shallower sleep with increased information processing during the sleep stages where the brain normally enters deep restorative rest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how age affected caffeine’s influence on the brain. In general, younger adults (ages 20–27) showed stronger responses to caffeine during REM sleep compared to middle-aged adults (ages 41–58). These age differences were especially apparent in measures of entropy and criticality. However, during non-REM sleep, the effects of caffeine were similarly robust across both age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for the age-related difference in REM sensitivity is that older adults have fewer adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a chemical that builds up in the brain during waking hours and promotes sleepiness. Caffeine works by blocking these receptors, reducing sleep pressure and promoting alertness. If older adults have fewer receptors, the blocking effect of caffeine may be weaker, especially in REM sleep when adenosine levels are already low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of the study was the use of multiple analysis techniques. In addition to traditional statistics, the researchers used machine learning models to classify whether EEG data came from the caffeine or placebo condition. These models reinforced the main findings and highlighted that complexity-related features were more informative than conventional measures of oscillatory power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that their results weren’t simply due to changes in sleep duration or structure, the researchers performed a control analysis. They equated the number of EEG samples from each sleep stage across both conditions. The results remained consistent, suggesting that the observed changes were due to caffeine’s impact on brain activity rather than differences in the amount of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are limitations. “Participants of the study were healthy, which does not allow for generalization to clinical populations,” Thölke noted. “As a result, from the current study it is difficult to determine whether the observed effects would hold in individuals with neurological or psychiatric conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study focused on short-term, nighttime caffeine intake and did not assess the effects of chronic use or withdrawal. Lastly, while the study draws on evidence linking EEG features to neural excitation and inhibition, it does not directly measure neurotransmitter activity or receptor binding, leaving some mechanistic questions open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore how these changes affect cognitive processes that depend on sleep, such as memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and learning. Studies in clinical populations could also help determine whether caffeine’s impact on sleep-related brain activity differs in people with insomnia, depression, or neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="http://Caffeine%20induces%20age-dependent%20increases%20in%20brain%20complexity%20and%20criticality%20during%20sleep"&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Philipp Thölke, Maxine Arcand-Lavigne, Tarek Lajnef, Sonia Frenette, Julie Carrier, and Karim Jerbi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 17:19:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQV0dDOFE5YnVlV2xmT01UTlJEUmZfUVJxY1pPVll3Qkp1dmVuNFBDcXBHSVVzYnhmZEVoOUF2Wm1SeDhaU0xKYmI5bHJ4cnUzVzJOUDVId2dwUEdCYzM3TTFTeXVaTk9tbE1WN3pTTGpMSkxyYmk2clVHSnNqQzlfcld1VjZXWnR1QmQwczVB</guid></item><item><title>我25岁，患有癌症，导致一半以上的癌症患者死亡……医生解雇了两种症状--《每日邮报》 | I'm 25 and I have cancer that kills more than half of those who get it...there are two symptoms doctors dismissed - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNa2pINFhoTjY2b0pjRGV1dWJmUlhHbjV5T1o1YldqZXcxby1ZdGRweThtdmJVU2daamdkOW94ZWdUc3dmdlZRd1JydG96MWp0YjF5M1VRNldsbzNpSTRrT2lma0p6d3VvenpsQWVDUmVxSXozWThpOVRYOFBkdTU2N2YtcXI1ek95RThnRWc3RHFEQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At just 25 years old, Savannah Caldwell had her whole life ahead of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-144e2fe0-6266-11f0-9851-215fe8bc2304"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; native was healthy, active, and cherished time with her friends and the four stepchildren she helped raise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when she began experiencing persistent exhaustion and aching bones, she turned to doctors for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians initially denied her tests saying she was 'too young for cancer', but after a lump was found on her chest they hey agreed to run further tests, and a biopsy was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Days later, she was diagnosed with&lt;span&gt; stage four breast &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c660c480-6258-11f0-9a93-c5561c6ddd82" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that had spread to her ribs, spine, lungs, and possibly her skull.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say breast cancer cases among young women are now &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fb-6039909/WHAT-BREAST-CANCER-PEOPLE-DOES-STRIKE-SYMPTOMS.html"&gt;rising by up to 1.85 percent per year, with an extra 4,000 women being diagnosed with the cancer annually in the US compared to a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While breast cancer in women in their 20s is rare, it's not unheard of.
