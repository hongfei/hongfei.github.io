But instead of wrapping it in toilet paper and tossing it into a bin, she put the tampon in a special plastic sample container, screwed the lid on tight and mailed it to an address in Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The address was that of NextGen Jane (NGJ), a Bay Area-based startup founded in 2014. And now Julia Carr, NGJ’s clinical research coordinator, stands in the company’s lab under a fume hood happily decanting a mixture of the woman’s blood and a preservation solution into a test tube. She will go on to pipette out small amounts to freeze and store for later analysis. NGJ has obtained about 2,500 menstrual blood samples this way – from women volunteering to send in their used tampons – for its research. That Carr is dealing with their period blood does not gross her out in the slightest. “This is a beautiful project for women’s science, and we are exploring a novel sample type,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Menstrual blood] is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;NGJ is one of a handful of small, mostly women-led “femtech” startups that, alongside a few academic research teams, are in a race to develop blood tests using menstrual effluent collected noninvasively at home. Usually, we use urine, saliva and, of course, blood drawn from our veins to test for a range of medical conditions. The FDA-approved Cologuard test allows people to collect their own feces and send them off for screening for colon and rectal cancer. These groups ask: why not also a fluid that half the world’s population produces monthly for a long stretch of their lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The big emphasis is on diagnosing gynaecological and reproductive health conditions for people who send in their period blood for analysis. But that blood could also be used to help track hormones, screen for cancers, monitor diseases such as diabetes and boost stem cell research. If Theranos became shorthand for Silicon Valley junk science, its proponents put menstrual-blood testing at the other end of the spectrum: an underexplored sample source whose clinical potential is only now being examined with scientific care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c4f64c19-b693-4831-b0b5-5eaa13caf14b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;NextGen Jane’s collection kit.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is an obvious biological specimen that has been totally neglected,” says Christine Metz, who co-leads the Research Outsmarts &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/endometriosis" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; (Rose) project out of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health. “It is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one had given much thought to analyzing menstrual effluent – which contains a mix of tissue from the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) as well as circulating blood and vaginal fluid – for the purpose of medical testing until the mid-2010s, when the Rose project and companies such as NGJ arrived on the scene. (“You matter PERIOD,” reads a tag in one of the stalls of NGJ’s arty, graffiti-decorated bathroom.) What &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m112.018390" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;little work that had been done to test period blood prior&lt;/a&gt; was mostly concerned with distinguishing menstrual from circulating blood, for police forensic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That it was overlooked for so long is not exactly surprising to those in the field. Women – their bodies, their health concerns – have been understudied due to a combination of historical exclusion from clinical research, persistent gender bias and societal stigma around menstruation and reproductive health. Much to do with women’s health research is woefully underfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An “ick” factor has slowed research with menstrual blood specifically, according to Renate van der Molen, an immunologist at Radboud University medical center in the Netherlands who uses the fluid to study various gynecological conditions. “It is thought of as dirty, a bit stinky and useless … People hesitate to give a sample,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet tapping menstrual blood makes sense, she says. Not only is it noninvasive and easy to obtain but, most importantly, it is unique in that it contains cells and molecules that reflect the state of a uterus. It can deliver messages to doctors that other bodily fluids may not. It is just “so different” to blood drawn from a vein, says van der Molen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All told, the startups and research groups see huge potential, even if it is early days. And one of the holy grails the field is hotly pursuing is endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="diagnosing-endometriosis" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosing endometriosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Having an easy test for diagnosing endometriosis would be a breakthrough, says Abigail Trotter, a 23-year-old living with endometriosis from Pennsylvania. That’s why she sent her period blood to NGJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f5a3a370-6edd-485c-b2ca-f0aa5b8a1bc2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"From 24/7 pain to tolerable symptoms, Botox is helping people living with endometriosis ","elementId":"f5a3a370-6edd-485c-b2ca-f0aa5b8a1bc2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/29/from-247-pain-to-tolerable-symptoms-botox-is-helping-people-living-with-endometriosis"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Endometriosis – in which tissue similar to the uterus’s endometrial lining grows outside the uterus in spots known as lesions, causing severe pelvic pain and heavy bleeding, and making it harder to get pregnant – is a debilitating disease. It is estimated to afflict more than 10% of women of reproductive age. Not only is there no cure and limited treatment options, but confirming a diagnosis can be a nightmare: the only way to do it is via laparoscopic surgery, typically performed under general anesthesia. Because endometriosis presents differently in different people and its symptoms resemble those of other conditions, it can take years to even get to the surgical diagnostic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trotter was surgically diagnosed with endometriosis late last year, after nearly a decade of pelvic pain and period problems. “All the years you go without it being diagnosed it is spreading, wreaking havoc on your inner parts,” she says. The surgery itself resulted in an under-the-skin infection that laid her so low she missed six weeks of work at the veterinary clinic where she is employed as a technician. (She recently underwent further surgery to remove her lesions robotically and is recovering well.) “A surgical procedure just to have it diagnosed … [That] really does need change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trotter came across NGJ’s work while recuperating from her diagnostic surgery and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;got in touch to receive a collection kit. She wanted to help other women avoid what she went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Developing a noninvasive, at-home test for endometriosis became NGJ’s main focus in 2021, though the company had been asking menstruators to mail in their used tampons for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After receiving enough samples, the company started hunting for molecular signals of gynaecological conditions by analyzing DNA, RNA and proteins. Particularly strong differences in messenger RNA, the molecule that tells cells which proteins to make and when, between women with and without endometriosis stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2e5aab6d-2e75-4159-9eab-6477f1f40712" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--supporting element-supporting dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ridhi Tariyal.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We leaned in,” says co-founder and CEO Ridhi Tariyal, noting that the company has fine-tuned its collection kit and is now confirming the approach works. (She remained tight-lipped about which exact biomarkers NGJ is focused on.) Tariyal adds that NGJ’s trove of stored samples provides it with a “jumping-off point” to explore other molecular signals for different gynaecological conditions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other players such as the Rose project are trying to develop a test for endometriosis using a predominately cellular rather than molecular approach, looking for abnormalities in the whole live cells in the period blood of people with the disease. There are differences in the quantity and shape of certain cells in women who have endometriosis versus women who don’t, explain Metz and her co-lead Peter Gregersen. “From that combination we can develop a diagnostic,” says Metz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rather than tampons, the Rose project collects samples with menstrual cups, so it can get the whole live cells. (Indeed, the perception that period blood is just dead material is wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So does Katherine Burns, an associate professor of environmental and public health sciences at the University of Cincinnati, who is also working on a test for endometriosis based on a different set of cellular abnormalities, and who herself lives with endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet menstrual cup collection, as it stands, could be a barrier. The cups can be messy, prone to spills and difficult to insert and remove, particularly for someone who has pelvic pain or has not had their period long (endometriosis starts in the teenage years, and the earlier the condition can be diagnosed the better). Developing a more comfortable and less spillable cup is a goal, say Metz and Gregersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond endometriosis, proponents point to several gynaecological conditions that menstrual blood could help diagnose – including other disorders of the endometrium such as adenomyosis and chronic endometritis, as well as fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome, and ovarian and endometrial cancers. Many of these conditions also go undetected for years and, in some cases, can only be confirmed through invasive procedures such as an endometrial biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately whichever method proves to be best at detecting endometriosis and when it might become available to buy remains to be seen. All require further studies, including in teens, and none are yet seeking regulatory approval. (While full FDA approval is the gold standard, there is a less tightly regulated but still legitimate &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/laboratory-developed-tests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pathway&lt;/a&gt; that allows companies to bring tests to market more quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, the good news for those with endometriosis, Burns notes, is that there are multiple irons in the fire. “We are all working towards the same goal to help diagnose endometriosis without surgery,” she says. “Do I hope and wish and pray that any of them are correct? You bet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="making-testing-a-reality" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making testing a reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond endometriosis, some startups and research groups are experimenting with a grab bag of other conditions and period blood collection techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;German startup Theblood, founded in 2022, is exploring how to use period blood collected via a menstrual cup to provide women with health status reports. It envisages an at-home test for hormone levels related to fertility, cycle health and perimenopause, typically done via a standard blood draw. It is also looking at inflammation markers with the aim of identifying patterns that might point toward chronic conditions earlier, and has studied using menstrual blood to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13237212" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;monitor vitamin levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In May, researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerland &lt;a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/05/sanitary-towels-morph-into-test-strips.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unveiled a prototype menstrual pad&lt;/a&gt; with a nonelectronic sensor that changes color in the presence of certain proteins in menstrual blood that could indicate disease, including potentially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then there is Qvin, another ambitious Bay Area-based startup also founded in 2014, which may be farthest ahead in the race to make menstrual blood testing a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, the company became the first to receive FDA approval for a special menstrual pad and test for women already diagnosed with diabetes to track blood sugar levels – an A1C test but using period blood rather than blood from a vein. The pad has a special collection strip where a small amount of blood pools and dries before it is mailed in to Qvin for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, Qvin has stopped offering the test directly on its website for the time being and pivoted to include a different market: governments and health organizations, particularly in the global south, seeking inexpensive and more convenient ways of detecting diseases for the millions of women they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health,” says co-CEO Sara Naseri. “We can make it easy for women to get information about what’s going on in their body, and get it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="95968930-93ef-44bd-a8b0-63e9f2648fe3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Qvin’s standing kit and Q-pad for blood sample collection.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Qvin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But only if Qvin’s pads are able to test a menstrual blood sample for more conditions than diabetes. It is selling its pad system to research institutions and large healthcare companies to encourage the development of more tests, including for endometriosis, and looking into getting additional FDA approvals of its own, like a test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), which is linked to cervical cancer and currently screened for with a Pap smear, and another for various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Indeed, it has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qvin-menstrual-blood-diagnostic-device-receives-fda-approval-in-thailand-301736890.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;already secured approval in Thailand&lt;/a&gt; for the former. A big advantage of the pad over tampons or cups is it is the most widely used menstrual product worldwide, says Naseri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kate Clancy is a biological anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she is using period blood to study endometriosis lesions, as well as author of the book Period,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which investigates the overlooked science of menstruation&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She has watched with interest as the field unfolds. Some of what she sees, she likes – including using period blood to test for endometriosis. “Conditions that actually affect the uterus I absolutely see a use case; it totally makes sense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she is skeptical of menstrual blood testing where a standard blood test already exists, such as A1C for diabetes or hormone testing to assess reproductive health. “Why wait until a person menstruates?” she says, adding that if an argument for the menstrual blood tests is that they increase women’s access to healthcare, the real answer lies in addressing the societal issues that limit access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She also raises a broader concern: while diagnostic tests provide clear answers, definitively confirming or ruling out conditions, a wave of new menstrual blood-based screening tests – which might, for instance, flag signs of cancer or STIs in healthy populations – could end up being burdensome, adding extra steps to confirm results and potentially needless anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And she urges caution around menstrual blood tests marketed more for health and wellness rather than medical purposes. Because they are not making medical claims, they are often less regulated and may sell insights about hormone balance or vitamin levels that have not been clinically validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are a ways from good translational work,” Clancy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-potential-stem-cell-source" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A potential stem cell source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is a “medical miracle” that happens once a month in women’s bodies, when the endometrial lining that is shed during menstruation regenerates, thickening explosively as new blood vessels sprout from existing ones, says Thomas Ichim, a scientist and biotech entrepreneur who co-authored &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-5-57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2007 paper&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery of stem cells in menstrual blood. It is stem cells in the endometrium – some of which slough off into period blood – that drive that process. “It’s logical to think that you can use those cells to stimulate blood vessel production in somebody else,” Ichim says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, menstrual fluid does not just have diagnostic and screening potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The big promise of stem cells is that one day they will be used by doctors to regenerate damaged tissue.

And when they were first discovered in menstrual blood, a flurry of research began exploring applications for treating gynaecological disorders, among other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Theoretically, menstrual blood could be a plentiful source of stem cells: donors could give by menstrual cup instead of undergoing an invasive biopsy to harvest them from bone marrow, as is practice now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But little of the initial increase in research ever advanced; according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.957164" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent estimate&lt;/a&gt;, just 0.25% of the adult stem cell research in recent years has involved menstrual blood-derived stem cells. Without a solid understanding of their basic utility, these stem cells are likely decades away from yielding therapies, says Brendan Harley, a tissue engineer also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (he and Clancy are married).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="93bc462f-e319-4a73-bc8d-03227b8390d6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,’ says researcher Caroline Gargett. ‘[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Andrew Brookes/Getty Images/Image Source&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fundamental work, he believes, is being held back in the US by the lack of funding and that ick factor– that anything related to menstrual blood is seen as dirty. “I think it has permeated folk’s thinking about using it for regenerative medicine,” Harley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2004, researcher Caroline Gargett &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.103.024109" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published her discovery&lt;/a&gt; of stem cells in the human endometrium, setting the scene for their later discovery in menstrual blood. These days Gargett, who works at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia, uses stem cells from the endometrium in her own work: helping treat pelvic organ prolapse. She says they have greater regenerative potential and longer lived effects than those in menstrual blood, though getting them requires invasive endometrial biopsy. “A lot of people have just gone, ‘well let’s try,’ with stem cells in period blood, without really understanding” the intricacies, she says. (For instance, menstrual blood contains a mixture of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;true stem cells and stem cell-like cells, making it more challenging to isolate a pure, reliable sample.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet she envisions an alternative use for menstrual blood. She would like to grow tiny, personalized models of the uterine lining for women with endometriosis, so-called “organoids”, from the fragments of endometrial tissue in their period blood. Each woman&lt;strong&gt;’&lt;/strong&gt;s “miniorgan” would be stored in a ‘menstrual fluid biobank’ and used to test how they respond to different drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,” Gargett says. “[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="264ed676-e624-4893-9fd5-3f1df451da99" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":60,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Stained panties, male guards and no privacy: what it’s like to have your period in prison","elementId":"264ed676-e624-4893-9fd5-3f1df451da99","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/prison-period"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Funding remains the biggest hurdle for period blood testing, say those in the field. While NGJ and Qvin, the Bay Area companies, have bagged roughly $20m in funding each since their inception over a decade ago, it is a small sum compared with vast amounts of cash sloshing around in Silicon Valley. The Rose project has no funding in place for the work of developing a better menstrual cup. Burns has had to pause development on her test for endometriosis because it is unfunded. Gargett has not yet secured funding for her biobank, though she continues to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a spot of good news, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched a $10m &lt;a href="https://cgr.mit.edu/2025/07/31/mit-launches-moonshot-for-menstruation-science/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menstruation science initiative&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “This is frontier science,” says Linda Griffith, director of MIT’s center for gynaepathology research and the initiative’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, NGJ wants to keep the flow of blood incoming: as the startup’s CEO Tariyal, not one to miss an opportunity, says: “If you’re thinking about how you can contribute, give us your tampon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNRGMzUG92YlFaYlNKME5yb0RzTE1OS29BVGl4cno2Zmhqakl6UXFfMGJJb2cyZjdJdU93STdwb1k1SE9RaWVhd0tvbDhkMW9TSzdzUVZxMF9wdG94MzBJUmVwRnNIQXZ6R1BNNUY1akpfZDlyTnlwRDc4b3JCMHZnM1Q0bTF2Zi01MFRBMW8tcXRvOWRFTTJWOEpoUWdnQWQ5emR4aC1iMFRlY0U</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19 mRNA疫苗能否帮助对抗癌症？ -半岛电视台</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09655-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has &lt;a href="/news/2025/8/9/how-rfk-jrs-vaccine-funding-cuts-fit-with-trumps-vision"&gt;slashed funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why is this being touted as groundbreaking?

In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-it-work"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_893764" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-893764" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-893764" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2ccf155507c742e595d8797bf6fa7276_18.jpeg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="China pharmaceuticals lab" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-893764" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A technician inspects anti-cancer drugs in vials at a lab of a pharmaceutical company in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China, on March 13, 2019 [File: Stringer/Reuters]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-cancer-patients"&gt;What does this mean for cancer patients?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-scientists-find-in-tests-with-mice"&gt;What did scientists find in tests with mice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRTV3d0xSMVlITGlLVGYtaDZUcjZJZjJTY05NSWpGeW1Wd0NxT1V5ZkhfSGtLd29mX0VTTUFBQTI0THJEZEE0ZFBGQm5ZalE4NEdvWG5IbGRDSEo5ZnZkQlFWZmFBa093WVZOblJMejdwTTZsQlY3aHRCMGYtVy1kMGVEV0l0VGdhM2hVNldmaUtGd9IBlwFBVV95cUxPaU9kV0VWdXJ6VTEtQm1HSUcwRkxSWVBBRk9zcEpvTV9Hd1dpM3M0YnQ1OXM3RjQxUFNrVlh4cU1NSVp1SHU4R3NsSWF3QjJ3UUZKT3JUVkx2bENZcEVPMXpUYmFuS3hVMGZDVnVJc1Q2aXZYaDc0Tk85UXBkeXRxUTFPQ3dRcjZEMVpIdVJWUjNva2VKd2Zn</guid></item><item><title>23岁的Evesham女士告诉BBC ，她太小了，不能得癌症</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly482jzw59o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;'I was told I was too young to have cancer'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b0f/live/fce50f70-b285-11f0-8aca-bd97d0c61a73.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="PA Media A young woman with long brown hair, wearing a black long sleeved top and a necklace.

According to Dr Dmitry Yaranov, MD, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-cardiologist-with-20-years-experience-says-you-dont-need-to-cut-out-every-bad-food-to-protect-your-heart-101761446844493.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiologist"&gt;cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;, who specialises in heart failure, advanced heart failure, heart transplantation, and mechanical circulatory support, it does not lead to good results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How can excess protein harm your heart?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Instagram video shared on October 27, titled ‘This is how a high-protein diet can lead to a heart attack at 35’, Dr Yaranov explained how years on extreme carnivore diets can be detrimental to your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-says-avoid-these-5-foods-to-reduce-heart-disease-risk-red-meat-high-sodium-diet-sweet-beverages-101761052650721.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart health"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote, “He looks like a statue. Shredded. Vascular. Peak performance. But I’ve seen what’s inside those vessels — and it’s not pretty.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the cardiologist, being on extreme diets like carnivore foods for years can lead to several heart health issues, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sky-high LDL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endothelial dysfunction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premature atherosclerosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Athletic ≠ healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov explained that, though when you are on a high-protein diet, your body on the outside looks like a machine, the inside, in most cases, tells a different story. He added, “I’ve cared for ‘fit’ 35-year-olds with heart attacks. No symptoms. No warning. Just a ticking time bomb.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, he warned that being athletic does not mean that you are healthy. Similarly, low body fat is also not equivalent to being low risk for any of the heart diseases. “A six-pack doesn’t protect you from a plaque rupture. If your diet destroys your endothelium — it doesn’t matter how strong your biceps are,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr Yaranov advised that if you really want to be healthy, it’s not about extremes.

They play a key role in many global diets and are often associated with improved heart health, metabolic balance, and overall wellness. However, emerging research highlights a potential link between peanut consumption and liver damage, primarily due to contamination by aflatoxins, toxic compounds produced by fungi during improper storage or processing. These aflatoxin-contaminated peanuts pose a serious risk to liver health, potentially leading to liver cirrhosis or cancer over time. Understanding safe storage, sourcing, and moderate intake is essential to enjoy the nutritional benefits of peanuts while protecting liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional value of peanuts and their effects on liver health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanuts are technically legumes, rich in nutrients that can support general and metabolic health. They contain protein, fat (mostly unsaturated), and dietary fibre. These nutrients help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and improve insulin sensitivity, both of which are beneficial for the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;"Unhealthy Lifestyle Damaging Liver Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these advantages, the risk of liver injury arises when peanuts are contaminated with aflatoxins, a type of toxic compound produced by certain fungi that grow under poor storage conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aflatoxins in peanuts: The key cause of liver damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are aflatoxins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aflatoxins are poisonous substances produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, fungi that thrive in warm and humid environments. Peanuts and other crops such as maize are particularly vulnerable to contamination during harvesting, drying, and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How aflatoxins affect the liver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once ingested, aflatoxin B1, the most potent form, is metabolised by liver enzymes into a reactive compound that binds to DNA. This interaction causes mutations in liver cells, particularly affecting the p53 tumour suppressor gene, which leads to cell damage, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7693493/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A study published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; noted that while nuts have metabolic benefits, they are at high risk for aflatoxin contamination, which can compromise liver function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-020-00420-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Another study published in BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that exposure to aflatoxins increases the risk of liver cirrhosis by approximately 2.5 times compared to non-exposed individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overconsumption of peanuts and fatty liver disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond contamination, another question arises: can eating too many peanuts harm the liver through excess fat intake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanuts are calorie-dense, and excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain and fat accumulation in the liver, particularly in individuals with metabolic syndrome or poor dietary balance. However, moderate peanut intake has generally been shown to improve metabolic health, not worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7693493/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A study published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;reported that nut consumption, including peanuts, was associated with better liver enzyme profiles and reduced inflammation in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The conclusion was that peanuts do not directly cause fatty liver, but rather may aid in its management when consumed appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the link between peanuts and fatty liver is indirect and dependent on portion size and overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When peanuts become dangerous: Risk factors for liver damage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aflatoxin contamination: Peanuts stored in humid or warm conditions without proper drying can grow mould, leading to aflatoxin production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor storage and handling: Lack of air circulation and exposure to moisture encourage fungal growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unregulated processing: Inadequate testing and safety controls increase contamination risk, particularly in low-resource regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-existing liver disease: Individuals with hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis are more susceptible to toxin-related injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive consumption: Large quantities of peanuts or peanut oil may contribute to excess calorie intake and fat accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preventing liver damage from peanuts: Practical safety measures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enjoy peanuts safely while protecting liver health, the following steps are recommended:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy from reputable brands that perform aflatoxin testing and meet food safety standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store peanuts properly in airtight containers, away from heat, sunlight, and humidity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid mouldy or discoloured peanuts; even a small amount of visible mould can indicate contamination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit portion size to around 30-40 grams several times per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversify nut intake to include almonds, walnuts, or cashews for balanced nutrient variety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discard stale peanut oil or any product with a rancid smell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consult healthcare professionals if you have an existing liver condition before significantly increasing nut intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement “peanuts cause liver damage” is only partially correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy, properly processed peanuts do not harm the liver and may even offer metabolic benefits. The danger arises when peanuts are improperly stored or contaminated with aflatoxins, leading to liver cell injury, fibrosis, or cancer over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, peanuts should not be labelled as inherently harmful.

In his latest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/instagram" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; post, cardiovascular research scientist Dr James DiNicolantonio explained, “Recognising these subtle, early signs can make a significant difference in preventing severe cardiovascular events.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the three early red-flags he emphasises and how you can respond to them -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="20949" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="erectile-dysfunction" source="Orion"&gt;Erectile dysfunction&lt;/keyword&gt; as a heart signal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr DiNicolantonio noteed that erectile dysfunction (ED) may serve as an early warning for cardiovascular trouble and cautioned, “About half of people with heart disease experience erectile dysfunction and it can precede heart disease by up to five years.” Since blood-flow issues in smaller arteries (such as penile arteries) often mirror what can be happening in coronary arteries, ED may reveal hidden cardiovascular risk. If you are experiencing ED, especially with no obvious lifestyle cause, discussing it with a clinician is wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="142940" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="shortness-of-breath" source="Orion"&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/keyword&gt; during mild activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One often dismisses it as "getting out of shape" or "just tired" but Dr DiNicolantonio flags dyspnoea or shortness of breath with light exertion as another key sign and warned, “If climbing a few stairs or doing light exercise leaves you unusually winded, it’s a signal that your heart may be struggling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention, whether you are parents juggling school runs or professionals managing long days or anyone who notices breathlessness on simple tasks. It may mean your heart is less efficient at pumping blood or your lungs are getting overburdened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The expert revealed, “Swelling in the feet, ankles, or lower legs can indicate heart failure or kidney dysfunction. Fluid retention is a common but often overlooked symptom of cardiovascular issues.” If you notice persistent swelling (especially alongside breathlessness or fatigue), it is time to see a doctor. It could indicate your heart isn’t effectively pumping blood, causing fluid to pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these early signs matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research supports the idea that the heart sends whispers long before it crashes into a major event. For instance, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-warning-signs-of-early-heart-failure?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 2023 review from Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; identified swelling, fatigue and breathlessness as early heart-failure signals. It is a general tendency for people to ignore heart failure symptoms and attribute them to just getting older but noticing these lesser-known symptoms and starting conversations early may lead to interventions (lifestyle, medical or both) that delay or prevent serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It can flick a light switch early, sometimes via unusual signs. Swelling in ankles, unexplained breathlessness or a shift in sexual health might be your body’s early alert. As Dr DiNicolantonio reminds us, acting when these signs appear can change the story. Wait for the crash? Or catch the whisper first. Tune in. Act early.

According to studies, oranges provide a rich supply of vitamin C that supports the structural integrity of eye tissues. This helps especially with preventing early clouding of the lens, one of the steps toward cataract formation. Vitamin C is concentrated in the eye lens and acts as an antioxidant. Over a lifetime, oxidative damage to lens proteins is a major driver of cataract formation but vitamin C helps slow that damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735187/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2016 meta-analysis in Acta Ophthalmologica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that “higher vitamin C intake and serum ascorbate might be inversely associated with risk of cataract.” In plain terms, people who consume more vitamin C tend to have lower rates of cataract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It is a go-to fruit when your eyes feel overworked. As per the studies, papaya supplies vitamin A precursors and other carotenoids, plus anti-inflammatory phytonutrients. Carotenoids support retinal and lens health and reduce chronic low-grade inflammation that helps preserve eye tissue over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157521001848" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Analyses of papaya in a 2021 carotenoid composition study by Food Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; confirm it as a good source of carotenoids and show bioaccessibility varies by variety but overall papaya offers lutein/zeaxanthin precursors and antioxidants useful for eye health. The broader nutrition literature highlights papaya’s anti-inflammatory nutrients that can lower oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, dice papaya into breakfasts or smoothies or pair with lime and chia for a quick anti-inflammatory snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="125932" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="kiwi" source="Orion"&gt;Kiwi&lt;/keyword&gt;: The green shield for your retina&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overlook kiwi. This green fruit contains plant compounds that support retinal health, especially protective against degeneration that can affect vision clarity over time and is part of the mix for sharper, healthier vision. Kiwi is unusually high in vitamin C and contains lutein/zeaxanthin along with other antioxidants that are a neat package for both lens protection and macular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of kiwifruit nutrition highlight its high vitamin C content and a supportive nutrient profile that can benefit eye health and general metabolic wellness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Clinical and observational evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; links dietary lutein/zeaxanthin (the carotenoids found in kiwis and leafy greens) with better macular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, slice a kiwi after dinner as a refreshing dessert, toss into salads or blend into green smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why diet matters more than you think for eye health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate vision problems with needing glasses or age catching up but behind that are physiological changes like oxidative stress, inflammation, blood-vessel damage and wear and tear on lens proteins. A diet rich in protective nutrients directly addresses these processes. According to the fruit studies, just including these fruits (with their vitamins, antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds) can make a meaningful difference in how your eyes feel and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are spending long hours on digital devices or living in a polluted/regional-smog context (hello big cities), or have diabetes/high blood sugar (which affects eye vessels), then the need to optimise your diet grows stronger. Make sure you pair fruit intake with other good practices for eye health. Take breaks from screens every 20 minutes (the 20-20-20 rule: look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes), ensure adequate lighting, control overall blood sugar and get annual eye check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your eyes are not just passive observers, they reflect what is going on inside your body and while you cannot reverse all age-related eye changes, you can hit “pause” on a lot of the damage with smart diet and lifestyle moves. The four fruits above are easy, affordable, delicious and effective. So the next time you go fruit shopping, think of your eyes too. With the right choices, you might not just see clearer today but you might protect how you see years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Vaping is dangerous, drinking is dangerous, stress is the silent killer, but when a heart surgeon puts them in order of just how dangerous he believes they are, coming from what he sees in the operating theatre, it hits differently. Cardiovascular surgeon Dr Jeremy London recently ranked five everyday lifestyle habits on just how bad he believes they actually are for our wellbeing. The revelations are eye-opening and also oddly empowering because knowledge is always the beginning of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaping — 10 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaping might be cool to behold, fruity-scented, and nicer than cigarettes, but in your body, it's just as toxic. Dr London gives vaping a score of 10 out of 10 for harm. He describes why vaping is so deceptive because individuals think it's a "healthier alternative." Really, though, it's just a different way of administering chemicals that still damage blood vessels and heart tissues. He has seen young patients that have never had a cigarette, but vape every day, develop signs of cardiovascular stress at an early point. The illusion of safety makes it even riskier because they legitimize addiction under a new label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Things that show you have a healthy heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress — 8 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is not necessarily bad, admits Dr London. The stress that compels you to meet deadlines or work yourself to the bone at practice sometimes toughens you up. But when stress becomes chronic, when it tips over into anxiety, burnout, or emotional exhaustion, it starts to nibble away silently in the heart. He calls stress an "invisible injury." You can't see it, but it affects everything from blood pressure to the sleep-wake cycle to food cravings. Chronic stress leads to inflammation, and inflammation is where disease typically begins. He rates it an 8 out of 10, not because it'll kill you, but because it slowly rots away at your health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soda — 4 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soda is not as bad as the rest, but Dr London still does not award it less than 4. He doesn't consume it himself, not just due to the sugar, but due to the addiction habit. The sweet drinks elevate your blood glucose, push the body towards insulin resistance, and ultimately to metabolic issues. Even diet soda isn't safe-he says it leaves people craving junk food, creating a vicious cycle. Soda might not be on the top of the threat list, but it's an insidious part of bad nutrition and unstable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep deprivation — 10 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, according to Dr London, is not an indulgence. It's a matter of medicine. He gives poor sleep a 10 for harm. The reason is simple-if you don't rest, your body doesn't repair itself. Hormones get out of balance, blood pressure rises, and the heart works too hard without rest. He says even he's had his own struggles with bizarre sleep patterns and seen how quickly it can affect mood, focus, and energy. Sleep deprivation not only makes you feel miserable but actually helps you live longer. It's one of those health determinants where folks don't want to believe in it until it gets them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol — 10 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final one on his list, is kind of an old-school one, alcohol, also gets a 10. That might be surprising for some given how prevalent social drinking is. But Dr London makes the point that alcohol damages at the cellular level — specifically brain and heart cells. It interferes with sleep, increases blood pressure, and in most cases, leads to addiction. Research now suggests that moderate drinking can increase the risk of dementia and cardiovascular disease. He describes the impact of alcohol as cumulative. Each leaves behind a residue, and after decades, those residues add up to create dramatic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the list, the message is clear, it's not necessarily what we're putting into our bodies, but how often we expose ourselves to damage. Vaping, sleeping, and booze all take the number one spot because they're both short-term and long-term risk. Stress follows soon after, triggering every other habit on the list. Even soda, which may seem insignificant, is how rapidly we can turn the norm out of something that should not be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. London's ranking game is a revelation, it is not to scare people off, but to help them make what is the most important a priority. His advice is quite simple: Pick one habit, try and discover its triggers, find replacement. Replace vaping with breathing breaks, replace soda with flavored water or fresh juice. Replace late-night scrolling with a bed-time practice. And most of all, tune in to yourself, stress and fatigue usually arrive way before disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究将无糖饮食饮料与更高的2型糖尿病风险联系起来- VINnews</title><link>https://vinnews.com/2025/10/26/study-links-sugar-free-diet-drinks-to-higher-type-2-diabetes-risk/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-613102" class="post-613102 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-breaking-news category-health category-world" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA (VINnews)— Drinking one can of Cola Zero or other sugar-free “diet” drinks daily may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 38%, according to a comprehensive 14-year study from Monash University. The findings, reported by ScienceAlert, reveal a higher risk compared to regular sugary soda, which carries a 23% increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers adjusted for factors such as diet, exercise, and body weight, suggesting the elevated risk is not solely tied to obesity. The study points to artificial sweeteners, commonly found in diet drinks, as a potential culprit. These sweeteners may disrupt the gut microbiome and impair metabolism, contributing to the development of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which tracked participants over 14 years, underscores the need for caution with sugar-free beverages marketed as healthier alternatives. Instead, researchers recommend water as a safe and effective hydration option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those looking to reduce their diabetes risk, swapping diet drinks for water may be a simple yet impactful choice. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind artificial sweeteners’ effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;

They had seen all the illnesses and tantrums. However, nothing prepared them for the odd behaviour of their youngest daughter, Austyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was "just not happy," and "never content," her mother told CBS News. Austyn never slept and cried constantly as an infant. As a toddler, she was "never smiling, never laughing," her mother added. The child had mild developmental delays and a tremor. After months of sleepless nights and growing concern, the family turned to genetic testing. When the results came back, they were shocked. The 18-month-old Austyn was diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare brain condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Chiari malformation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the NHS, a Chiari malformation occurs when the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiari-malformation/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;lower part of the brain pushes down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; into the spinal canal. This is a rare condition. Chiari malformation affects about 1 in 2,000 people, as per Dr. David Harter, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone, Most are born with it, and while its exact cause remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions are caused by problems in the structure of the brain and skull. There are 4 main types, but type 1, called Chiari I, is the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chiari I, the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal, leading to pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord, and obstructing the flow of fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29905521" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-Chiari-malformation" source="keywords"&gt;Symptoms of Chiari malformation&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many people, Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. It is often found after an MRI scan of the brain.

Further tests revealed that Austyn’s spinal cord was under severe compression, blocking the flow of spinal fluid. She needed brain surgery. Dr. Jeffrey Greenfield performed a decompression surgery in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, Austyn woke up different. “She was ready to go. She was trying to get out of bed, and she was trying to walk. She was smiley. It was like the pain she'd always felt was gone, and the pain of surgery didn't match what she'd always felt. She was just ready to run laps around the ICU,” the mother recalled. “When we did the follow-up with Dr. Greenfield, I told him, ‘You gave me her laugh.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the family thought their challenging days were behind, 3-year-old Amelia fell sick. This was just five days after returning home. They thought it was Lyme disease and took her to the hospital, only to find that Amelia also had Chiari malformation, along with a tethered spinal cord, which, according to the NIH, is a condition in which the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/tethered-spinal-cord-syndrome%5C" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;spinal cord attaches abnormally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amelia underwent two surgeries in October 2023, both performed by Dr. Greenfield. She recovered quickly, but the family’s ordeal was far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump’s Bizarre Dance At Malaysia Airport Sparks Health Speculation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, the couple noticed their 7-year-old daughter, Aubrey, was being unusually moody and suffered frequent urinary infections. Recognizing the pattern, the mother pushed for an MRI, and her instincts were right. Aubrey, too, had both Chiari malformation and a tethered spinal cord. The child underwent surgery in November 2023. “She was our happy kid, and it was like one day we were losing her,” Ashlee said. “After surgery, we got her back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the next. 11-year-old Adalee, who had long complained of leg pain, was diagnosed with the same conditions. Adalee underwent surgery in March 2025 and made a strong recovery, even joining her school’s dance team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained that 10% of Chiari malformation cases have a genetic link; however, it’s rare for multiple siblings to share the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eldest two children tested negative for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia spends a lot of time thinking about the last years of his life – and yours too. He's declared war on what he calls the marginal decade, the final years of life that are plagued by sickness and immobility. It's not often that 60 Minutes does a story on a physician who has fewer than 75 patients, but the Stanford-trained Attia has become both a pioneer and a star in the growing field of longevity medicine. His stark diagnosis – and advice on what to do about it – have attracted millions of followers, and billionaire patients who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hear the words "Dr. Attia will see you now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: At 75, both men and women fall off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: At 75?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: At the population level, it's unmistakable what happens at the age of 75. That's what we're up against. That's what I'm thinking about in the practice is, how do I create an escape velocity that gets somebody another 15 years there? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: And so is your goal to minimize or essentially erase that marginal decade?&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life. My goal is to make the marginal decade as enjoyable as possible. The way I explain it to my patients is, that last 10-15 of your years, if you don't do anything about it, you will fall to a level of about 50% of your total capacity, cognitively, physically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: And when people hear that you're like, "I don't wanna be that. That's not how I want to spend the last decade of my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. A lot of people respond that way as though they're hearing this for the first time. Although if you ask them, "Haven't you seen people in this state?" They'll say, "Well, yeah, I guess I have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Right. Likely their own relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Sure. Their own parents even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: So do you consider yourself a new kind of doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: No, I don't think so. What we're doing is creating a framework that fits directly into this idea of how to train for the marginal decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That training begins here in Austin, Texas, where Attia is based. This is where his patients go through two days of physical evaluation, and where we found, after just a few hours, how intense the 52-year-old doctor and his methods are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move? And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: How do we know that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: The data are pretty clear. When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia and his team say the key indicator of overall health and longevity is a test called VO2 max. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like the name of a sports car, but essentially it's a measurement of the size of someone's engine, and their capacity to use oxygen to generate power with their muscles, heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Luke Bennett - "There you go, that's the hardest part of your day done."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Even though you say I-- I scored fairly well on my VO2 max &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Luke Bennett - "There we go, 42.1" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norah O'Donnell - "OK that's good!" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: You say I'm still not good enough for Dr. Peter Attia. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Yes, your VO2 max was gonna place you at the 85th percentile for women your age. And I think it's worth taking a victory lap. But tomorrow, we should come back and plan on what we're gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: You think anyone, whether they're 45 or 65, should be training like athletes. Not for the Olympics but essentially for advanced age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Absolutely. Life is a sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia says the best drug to delay physical and cognitive decline is exercise, and he takes it in large doses. He aims for about 10 hours a week: cardio to burn fat; intense intervals for VO2 max; and weightlifting to maintain strength and muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He developed his program after turning his back on the medical establishment nearly 20 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While training to be a cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins he got burnt out caring for so many terminal patients. He quit his residency, and became a management consultant. After becoming a father and discovering he was at risk of developing diabetes, he made big changes, personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: After my daughter was born, all I could think about was, "Oh my God," like, "I wanna-- I wanna have as much time as possible on this planet with this baby." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's when he decided to become his own first patient in a new specialty: longevity medicine. Today he considers himself neither a primary care physician nor a provider of concierge care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Dr. Attia is prescribing is a radical change in how Americans think about their own health care, driven by the patient, focused on prevention — a practice he calls "Medicine 3.0." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: We're dying of heart disease, we're dying from stroke, cancer, dementia, Type II diabetes, and we I think have sort of come to realize that, "Hey, the playbook of Medicine 2.0 which is treat a disease when a disease is present, doesn't seem to work as well." And so the first principle of Medicine 3.0 is you have to take a much longer arc on the prevention of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means using existing diagnostic tools in novel ways, like the DEXA scan, that checks bone density, as well as muscle mass and body fat. It typically costs under $300 and Attia says it's, quote, "almost criminal negligence" most women don't get one until they're 65. Another scan he employs is more costly, and not covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: There are certain things that you recommend that are controversial, like regular preventive full-body MRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Early detection matters. The earlier you can treat a cancer, the smaller the burden of the tumor at the time of treatment, the greater your odds of success. Now, let's talk about the flip side of that because it is going to detect a lot of things that are not cancer. That means you have a lot of false positives. If you're not willing to go through that experience, as traumatic as it is, you should not engage in this level of screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Do you get them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also suggests patients get tested for the APOE gene, related to risk for Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Dr. Attia oversaw genetic testing for actor Chris Hemsworth, who learned he was eight to ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Dr. Attia sees fewer than 75 patients, and there's a long waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: And how much does it cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: It is a six-figure program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Like, $100,000, or $500,000, or $800,000? 'Cause that's a big range.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc8" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",8]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Much closer to $100,000 than $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: That's a lot of money. I mean, what do you get for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: You don't get-- I mean, you don't live forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Nope. You're getting access to me, a team of a couple other physicians, a strength and conditioning team, a nutrition team. And what you're really getting is a path to help you achieve your goal of living longer and living better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitch has proved extremely popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His book "Outlive,"  part memoir, part medical manifesto, has sold nearly three million copies, and made him a top draw at longevity medicine events like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his podcast, that's been downloaded over 100 million times, tackles a wide range of topics, including menopause and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia wants his patients to eat a lot of protein — more than double what the current nutritional guidelines recommend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor and a handful of his patients have also taken a drug called Rapamycin that's FDA-approved for use by transplant recipients. The drug has extended the lifespan of mice, but Dr. Attia&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stopped taking it, for now, because it gave him mouth sores, which can be a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are physicians, including a respected professor of public health we spoke to, who are skeptical that his extraordinary regimen will result in an extra decade of healthy life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: When a fellow physician calls some of what you're talking about, "Hocus pocus"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: People are entitled to think what they want. And just because someone is a physician, doesn't mean they're even remotely equipped to evaluate the merits of exercise physiology. Remember, I went to Stanford Medical School, right? How many hours of education do you think I received on exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Probably, a few hours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Zero hours. And how many hours did I receive on nutrition? Zero hours. It was 25 years ago, so, maybe things have changed. But I'm pretty sure that if you're talking to other esteemed physicians, they're in the same bucket as me. So, you know, they might not be the ones that are best equipped to be my critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our last morning in Austin, Dr. Attia took us for a ruck, a hike with weighted backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: This, to me, is as much about mental health and socialization, being in nature. And rucking is simply a vehicle to get that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: How much work do you do on your emotional and mental health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: A lot. I mean, it's-- as much a practice as what I put into exercise or, you know, blood work, and cancer screening, and all the other things that make up physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia has been open about dealing with depression and anger stemming from abuse he suffered as a child. Through therapy, including two stays at inpatient care facilities, he says he turned a corner about five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline. But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says progress was only possible because his wife of more than 20 years, Jill, stood by him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: There is plenty of data on longevity and people-- living long that have very strong relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation. I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: What's the point of living long if you don't have people to share it with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: What's-- or– "What's the purpose of living longer if you're unhappy?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia plans on launching a new digital health app next year. He says that 80% of his program does not require a physician, and is adamant it's never too late to begin delaying the inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: How long do you want to live?&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc12" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",12]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: You know, I want to live to be old enough to have a meaningful relationship with as many of my grandkids as I can. That probably means, making it into my 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: 'Cause you must be plotting that with your VO2 max?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. You know, it's funny, we do an exercise with our patients, which is called the timeline exercise. So if we were doing this for you, we would draw-- you know, we would draw a line for Norah. So you're 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: And then, I would draw a tick at 61, 71, 81, 91, 101, and then, we would draw all three of your kids. And then, we would start to extrapolate, when do you think they're gonna have kids? And so you're gonna draw their first grandkid, and we're gonna map your life out, according to this timeline. And you're gonna see, pretty quickly, what it's all about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: That really kind of puts it in great perspective for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: So, yes, I've mapped my life out, in that regard. And I know that the difference between being 80 and 90 is huge, in terms of what I can have with those kids.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Only since November last year has she been able to eat properly and return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating is never going to be the same for me and you are always worrying about something coming back,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know that I should be looking at my tongue or sticking my tongue right out my mouth to properly look at what’s going on. I didn’t even know that I had anything there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have anything you need to book a test straight away. Obviously it depends if the dentist is trained, which mine luckily was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Diagnosed with breast cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has now been diagnosed with breast cancer and has been undergoing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately I have been diagnosed with breast cancer now which is totally unrelated to the mouth,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been going through chemotherapy. But I think I am doing ok.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mouth Cancer Foundation charity said more than 3,600 people died of mouth cancer last year nationally – a 20 per cent rise over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New cases of mouth cancer in the UK reached 10,825 last year – an increase of 38 per cent in the last decade and by 133 per cent compared with 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two-in-three (68 per cent) of mouth cancers in the UK are diagnosed in men.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s also a school of thought in nutrition that white rice is the poor choice because it’s lower in fiber than brown rice. But it isn’t that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The truth is, white rice is accessible, convenient, quicker to cook, and a staple for many communities of color that has received a lot of judgment from “a foundation in racism and whiteness because brown rice is seen as the elite choice for nutrition and is found readily in stores in affluent areas,” explains &lt;a href="https://thetessanguyen.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tessa Nguyen, MEd, R.D., L.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tessa Nguyen, MEd, R.D., L.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professional chef, registered dietitian, and founder of Taste Nutrition Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both types can be used interchangeably in recipes, but white rice tends to be softer and fluffier while brown rice is heartier and slightly chewy, she adds.

Because brown rice is a complex carbohydrate, it also provides vitamins and minerals (like iron) and can provide more energy than white rice, Perez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Perez says the whole bran and germ can also deliver antioxidants and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28274454/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phytonutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;phytonutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, paired with fiber, can support gut and immune health, as well as cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6025443/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show that brown rice contains phenolic acids, which are the most common antioxidants in our diet that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Cons of brown rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the flip side, brown rice may be difficult to digest because it contains an anti-nutrient known as phytate that can hinder your body’s ability to absorb certain minerals from food, according to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33336992/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As previously mentioned, brown rice also takes longer to cook. A February 2025 study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.70008" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Risk Analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; also reviewed brown rice and detected arsenic in all 145 types that were tested, but determined no general public health risk associated with the findings. (More on that below.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Benefits of white rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When enriched, white rice will have a variety of vitamins and minerals so the differences between brown and white rice are not so significant,” says &lt;a href="https://mayafellernutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian nutritionist at Brooklyn-based Maya Feller Nutrition and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eating-Our-Roots-Home-Cooked-Favorites/dp/0593235088/ref?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.68858435%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites from Cultures Around the World;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites from Cultures Around the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Food labels and packaging will call out if rice is enriched. White rice also provides energy like any other carbohydrate. And although brown rice has more fiber, white rice still has some, which is worth pointing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“One of the most important benefits of white rice is that it is integrated into many cultural cuisines,” Perez adds. “White rice is surrounded by tradition, family, and connection. It goes beyond just physical nourishment. Being able to keep parts of your culture alive absolutely feeds you mentally and helps fulfill you too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you don’t add fat (say, in the form of butter), white rice is low in calories and paired perfectly with with vegetables or lean protein. Our experts note that it also may be easier to digest than brown rice because of its lower fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Cons of white rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;White rice may increase blood sugar, especially if over-consumed, as it’s higher on the glycemic index, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22422870/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted. The aforementioned processing could mean it has less nutrients, but many brands are re-enriched with the good stuff. Lastly, white rice is not as good as a source of fiber as brown rice is, and fiber is “sorely lacking in most Americans’ diets,” says &lt;a href="https://drjanet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Janet Brill, P.h.D., R.D.N., F.A.N.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Janet Brill, P.h.D., R.D.N., F.A.N.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307339114?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.68858435%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cholesterol Down;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cholesterol Down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Is white or brown rice healthier?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating brown rice is a great way to increase your whole grain intake, but both have their benefits, Perez says. When it comes down to it, Perez suggests choosing whichever you love to eat and making sure &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;elements of your plate meet your nutrition goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;White rice is rarely consumed on its own, and you have an opportunity to pack in a ton of nutrients with the other ingredients like fresh vegetables and lean protein, so the type of rice doesn’t make that much of a difference, Perez says. It can come down to personal preference. “People should make food choices based on affordability, accessibility, current health status, and cultural relevance,” Feller says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Can I eat rice every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If someone wants to eat rice each day it’s absolutely ok,” Feller says. “There are a number of cultures around the globe that eat rice as a staple part of their pattern of eating.” As with any food, Brill says portion control is important for those looking to maintain or lose weight, and if you are managing your blood sugar, consult your doctor or a dietitian about eating it in ways that work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why did people stop eating brown rice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You may have heard of people steering clear of brown rice after a February 2025 study detected arsenic—a toxic element that is part of the earth’s crust and ends up in soil, water, and the environment—in a lot of it. In its inorganic form, arsenic is considered a carcinogen, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. However, the brown rice tested in the recent study contained arsenic because of where it was grown, and because it isn’t processed and therefore stripped of its natural state. Therefore, the study found that these small potential exposures posed no acute public health risks to the general American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With that being said, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Fdestini-moody&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa68858435%2Fbrown-rice-vs-white-rice-benefits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Destini Moody, R.D., C.S.S.D., L.D.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Destini Moody, R.D., C.S.S.D., L.D.&lt;/a&gt; dietitian at Live It Up says she doesn’t see brown rice disappearing. “I actually feel as if brown rice is more popular now than I’ve seen it in my professional career,” she says. “I believe this has something to do, in part, with more public awareness about the health benefits of eating for more controlled blood sugars.” People are also wanting to eat less refined grains in excess, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What is the best rice for weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even throwing in the likes of black, red, and wild rice, I’d still say brown rice is the best for weight loss,” says Moody. “Though all rice is similar in calorie content, the high fiber content of brown rice means it hangs out in the stomach for longer, making the meal feel more satisfying for a longer period of time. This level of hunger control can help one eat less throughout the day and can prevent one from feeling as if they are starving while dieting in a calorie deficit.” The consumption of brown rice has even been linked to &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-016-0126-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower body weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;lower body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNbzNDZlBjWDYtSmc0M045TlFjbmcwN3dHS0R6N2p6VHNTcHpGTFdBTjVzN09QRktCbmRtdVlNYldkc2Nfd2ZkTGV1Nm1SSzhSNG51bU1tTkNvb1kzMU1UYm5yZkpoV1B5RmhHRVdnbmlNNExlekJjcTk5eTFhMmJnSw</guid></item><item><title>新的政府科学项目正在全面绘制人类隐藏的“第六感” - Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/our-body-has-a-hidden-sixth-sense-interoception-that-helps-keep-us-alive/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every human body hums with quiet communication. Beneath every heartbeat, breath, and immune signal lies a hidden conversation between the brain and internal organs. This constant exchange keeps us alive, yet we rarely notice it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now decoding this “sixth sense,” called interoception, to reveal how our brains stay tuned to the body’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent initiative by experts at the Scripps Research Institute and the &lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Allen Institute&lt;/a&gt; aims to chart this mysterious network in detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, backed by the National Institutes of Health (&lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;), will create the first-ever neural atlas of interoception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research could ultimately reshape how we understand brain-&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-set-the-record-straight-by-clarifying-common-myths-about-body-language/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; communication and open new pathways for treating complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-vision-beyond-boundaries"&gt;A vision beyond boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project brings together experts from neuroscience and genetics. The team is led by nobel laureate Dr. Ardem Patapoutian, a professor of neuroscience at the &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH has committed $14.2 million over five years to make this vision possible. The project represents a rare collaboration that bridges structural, molecular, and functional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-do-women-live-longer-than-men-animals-reveal-the-answer/"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My team is honored that the NIH is supporting the kind of collaborative science needed to study such a complex system,” said Dr. Patapoutian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-sixth-sense"&gt;Understanding the sixth sense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoception differs greatly from familiar senses such as vision or hearing. While those rely on specialized organs to detect external cues, interoception monitors the body’s internal world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its network of neurons constantly tracks heartbeats, digestion, blood pressure, and immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intricate system operates mostly beyond our awareness. Scientists describe it as the body’s “hidden sixth sense,” responsible for maintaining balance, comfort, and readiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its importance, interoception has long remained poorly understood. Signals from deep inside the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-just-once-or-twice-a-week-has-a-major-impact-on-health/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; are difficult to record and interpret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurons that carry them are scattered across organs, blending into tissues that are hard to isolate. Dr. Patapoutian and his team hope to change that through careful mapping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our results will help other scientists ask new questions about how internal organs and the nervous system stay in sync,” said Dr. Li Ye, a professor at Scripps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-the-brain-body-links"&gt;Tracing the brain-body links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research will unfold in two major phases. The first will involve labeling sensory neurons to trace their routes from the spinal cord to internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced whole-body imaging will produce high-resolution 3D maps of these neural connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second phase will use genetic profiling to distinguish neuron types responsible for sending signals from different organs such as the gut, bladder, or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These combined efforts will form the first standardized reference for understanding how internal sensory pathways are structured and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting neural atlas could serve as a blueprint for the entire field of body-brain research, offering insight into how our nervous system integrates internal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-found-the-metabolic-ceiling-that-limits-human-endurance/"&gt;signals&lt;/a&gt; to maintain stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-significance-of-the-sixth-sense"&gt;Significance of the sixth sense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoception influences almost every vital process in the body. When this communication falters, the results can be severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have linked disrupted interoceptive signaling to autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, high blood pressure, and even neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping how these pathways work, scientists hope to understand why such conditions occur and how they might be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interoception is fundamental to nearly every aspect of health, but it remains a largely unexplored frontier of neuroscience,” said Dr. Xin Jin, associate professor at Scripps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By creating the first atlas of this system, we aim to lay the foundation for better understanding how the brain keeps the body in balance, how that balance can be disrupted in disease and how we might restore it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-listening-to-the-body-s-quiet-signals"&gt;Listening to the body’s quiet signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creation of a neural atlas for interoception represents more than an achievement in neuroscience. It is a quest to understand what makes our internal experience possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sensation – from a fluttering heartbeat to the calm after deep breathing – depends on signals that our brain quietly interprets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By charting this hidden system, scientists hope to transform that silence into understanding. This research will help us tune into the body’s quiet messages and, in doing so, learn how to heal from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mapping-the-sixth-sense"&gt;Mapping the sixth sense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH’s Transformative Research Award recognizes projects that dare to cross boundaries and challenge conventions. Established in 2009, this award funds interdisciplinary work with the potential to reshape human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Scripps and Allen Institute teams, it provides an opportunity to turn a scientific mystery into a measurable map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work is not only about neurons and organs, but also about uncovering how awareness arises from within. The project could illuminate why emotions, stress, and physical sensations are so deeply intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research may also help develop therapies that restore internal balance in conditions where communication between the brain and body breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8ccbe339-cbe1-4cd6-a8be-c11242db49b8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8b05bbf5-d035-4b30-9a95-ff1d53f72d45"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-b12e5732-0b61-49a5-9936-fb4b54f06e7f"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-dcccefa8-a45e-4859-829e-cb01c7743ac3"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:38:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQTzFwUGFYN2lTbnpqc1k2bHVJOWY2Y1JpX0IyRTVZVmwyM21aTE9wM0pCQU1wblZ3SFhWZ2xkQS1vc0NSM25UcXVrV3pOMF90aEZIc1lzSXgxajVCUkMxc3BfWlFaYnVSai1IbS1MMnI4ZFotNjY2MGNQakNIdWdPWXByRHhjMEhyQ0czSEo3ZzlLbmFEZGhKNldIQWNfQjVGRWc</guid></item><item><title>研究显示， 32%的老年痴呆病例与未经治疗的听力损失有关- KOMO</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/october-is-national-protect-your-hearing-month-hearing-loss-and-dementia-linked-in-study-jama</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;October is National Protect Your Hearing Month, and a recent study is linking untreated hearing loss with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An 8-year &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840522" target="_blank" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840522" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)&lt;/a&gt; found that 32% of dementia cases in adults aged 66 to 90 years could be linked to untreated audiometric hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What this study shows is hearing is about brain health,” Hearing instrument specialist Dennis Tembreull said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed nearly 3,000 patients throughout those 8 years and found that dementia cases linked to untreated hearing loss were comparable between mild and moderate or greater hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives us definitive proof for patients that we can show them there is a risk, there is a reason to treat your hearing loss,” Tembreull said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 20% of patients treat their hearing loss, due to factors like cost, or sometimes not even realizing it is there, Tembreull said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hearing loss is not often seen as the disability it is, but it takes us away from our relationships and from connecting us to the world,” according to Tembreull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tembreull said the best practice is to start having screenings after the age of 50.

People in higher-expectancy states tend to have better access to primary care, cleaner air, safer roads, and more walkable neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also show lower rates of smoking and obesity and higher levels of education, which all push life expectancy up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-state-life-expectancy-numbers"&gt;State life expectancy numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolinians have shorter life expectancy than most Americans in other states. The average &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-life-expectancy-is-projected-to-increase-by-5-years-by-2050/"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; in the state sits at 73.5 years, a bottom ten finish based on federal data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States overall reached 77.5 years in 2022, according to a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows a clear gap between South Carolina and the nation. This difference reflects health risks that stack up across years, not just moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis from a digital health group compared states on public resources, food options, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/135-million-people-died-prematurely-due-to-pm25-air-pollution/"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, hospital readmissions, and overall longevity. The index used a percent-rank, a simple score that shows where a state stands relative to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina snapshot shows more unhealthy food outlets than healthy ones, fewer parks and gyms per person, and higher smoking than many states. Those ingredients line up with a shorter average lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-and-life-expectancy"&gt;Mood and life expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind and body do not run on separate tracks. One large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4461039/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; linked mood and mental disorders to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-high-resilience-live-up-to-ten-years-longer/"&gt;shorter lives&lt;/a&gt; across dozens of studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that life expectancy dropped by as much as 32 years in people with mental disorders regardless of the state, with a median loss of around 10 years, highlighting the profound toll that mental health can take on overall longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress loads the body with repeated spikes in hormones and inflammation. That biological wear and tear is called allostatic load, the stress cost your body pays to stay in balance over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimistic outlooks are not magic, but they track with healthier sleep, steadier blood pressure, and more consistent care seeking. A depressed mood can do the opposite by draining energy for activity and treatment follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-states-shape-life-expectancy"&gt;Why states shape life expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index counted parks, trails, pools, and gyms because easy access nudges everyday movement. More active time lowers blood pressure and weight, and it improves mental health symptoms that fuel risk cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air quality matters too. Fine particles known as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-air-pollution-impacts-brain-health/"&gt;PM2.5&lt;/a&gt;, tiny soot that reaches deep into lungs, raise risks for heart and lung disease, according to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food landscapes tilt decisions in quiet ways. If a neighborhood has more fast food than produce, then over time that shows up in cholesterol, blood sugar, and weight, which erode years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals signal system health as well. A higher hospital readmission rate, the share of people who return within 30 days, hints at gaps in follow up care and discharge support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to national tobacco control authorities, cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of disease, death, and disability in the United States, a conclusion supported by decades of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-related-deaths-will-surge-by-2030/"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; prevalence has improved compared with past decades, but it still hovers above the best performing states. That matters because tobacco accelerates heart disease, stroke, several cancers, and severe lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-index-was-built"&gt;How the index was built&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Healthy States Index that predicts life expectancy used counts of parks, gyms, walking routes, and pools from open mapping data, then adjusted those counts by state population size. It also tallied healthy and unhealthy food outlets to reflect access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollution scores looked at major air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. These gases are linked to breathing problems and heart disease, which can shorten life when exposure stays high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scoring used a percent-rank system, which ranks each state from lowest to highest across all categories. This approach makes comparisons fair, even between states with very different sizes and populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-move-the-needle"&gt;What can move the needle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, small consistent steps chip away at risk. A daily walk, a steady sleep schedule, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-improves-when-you-quit-smoking-no-matter-your-age/"&gt;smoke free living&lt;/a&gt; push in the right direction when repeated over months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the community side, more safe sidewalks, park upkeep, and transit routes can raise daily activity for entire neighborhoods. Investments in primary care and mental health clinics increase timely treatment, which eases allostatic load by stabilizing stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;System fixes help, too. Hospitals and insurers can lower readmissions by scheduling fast follow ups, checking home access to food and medications, and coordinating rides to clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-states-can-boost-life-expectancy"&gt;How states can boost life expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health data can feel distant, but it points to real, everyday choices. Many people underestimate how small environmental or lifestyle changes ripple through a community’s health over decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cities invest in cleaner air, better grocery access, or smoke-free policies, the results often show up in lower hospital visits and longer lives. These gains may seem gradual, yet they accumulate into years of difference across an entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State averages hide large gaps between counties and zip codes. Some South Carolina communities outperform the state, while others face higher burdens from poverty, traffic emissions, and storm damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open mapping and administrative data can miss locations or misclassify a few sites. The index notes that counts may be off slightly, but the broad patterns remain clear enough to guide action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:09:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOXgyUWstMkJoTGw5empHekFWUmU4VkR0R3p1elNYY2NCc1gtRFR0cGpTejRmbnA0bGhEc1RPM25iSzMtU0g4NGNnazZmbGxWTENiMTFmQk1FWEdsaTZkX1ZNOGxuU3Jxd05NSGhyeFFyaTZSM1VYYmJtd3NLTW9TSGl0NTllUXRabkpCcG9vS3NWZVRPM1JacTJyVkF6WHpEWE1QWUdB</guid></item><item><title>“危险”的叮咬日蚊继续在湾区蔓延- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/dangerous-invasive-mosquitoes-spread-in-bay-area-21121040.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging people to heed caution after an invasive species of “aggressive, day-biting” &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/invasive-mosquitoes-found-bay-area-21083526.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; have continued to spread in the Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning no longer than a quarter of an inch and distinguished by the white markings on their legs, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are capable of spreading diseases to people like yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.

Those who always listened to music showed a 39% lower risk of developing dementia and better memory performance, while those who played instruments had a 35% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining both activities offered an even greater protective effect against cognitive decline. Researchers suggest that engaging with music could be an accessible, enjoyable strategy to help maintain brain health in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Risk Drop:&lt;/strong&gt; Always listening to music lowered dementia risk by 39%; playing instruments reduced risk by 35%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Music engagement was linked to higher overall cognitive and episodic memory scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support music as a simple, lifestyle-based intervention for brain health in aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Monash University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to music when you are over 70 years of age has been linked to a 39 per cent reduction in the risk of dementia, according to a Monash University-led study of over 10,800 older people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Monash honours student Emma Jaffa, and Professor Joanne Ryan, looked at the benefits of listening to music or playing music in people aged over 70, finding that always listening to music compared with never/rarely/sometimes listening to music was associated with a 39 per cent decreased risk of dementia. While playing an instrument was associated with a 35 per cent reduction in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113561"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows an older lady listening to music." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/music-dementia-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While regularly engaging in both music listening and playing was associated with a 33 per cent decreased risk of dementia and 22 per cent decreased risk of cognitive impairment. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, and the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) sub‐study and was published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that always listening to music was associated with the greatest reduction in dementia risk, with a 39 per cent lower incidence of dementia and 17 per cent lower incidence of cognitive impairment, as well as higher scores in overall cognition and episodic memory (used when recalling everyday events). While regularly engaging in both music listening and playing was associated with a 33 per cent decreased risk of dementia and 22 per cent decreased risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ms Jaffa, the findings of the study “suggests music activities may be an accessible strategy for maintaining cognitive health in older adults, though causation cannot be established,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population ageing has become a global public health concern due to advances in medicine and technology extending human lifespans, and this longer life expectancy has also meant an increase in the prevalence of age‐related diseases, including cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no cure currently available for dementia, the importance of identifying strategies to help prevent or delay onset of the disease is critical,” senior author Professor Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evidence suggests that brain ageing is not just based on age and genetics but can be influenced by one’s own environmental and lifestyle choices. Our study suggests that lifestyle-based interventions, such as listening and/or playing music can promote cognitive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761503085057"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How does music listening affect dementia risk in older adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; People over 70 who consistently listen to music have a 39% lower chance of developing dementia compared to those who rarely or never listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761503095412"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Does playing an instrument have similar benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Potential effect modification by education was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gps70163-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used secondary data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, and the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) sub-study. Included were 10,893 community-dwelling Australian adults who were 70 years and older, without dementia diagnosis at recruitment to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the association between level of music engagement (listening to music, playing an instrument, and a combination of both) and dementia risk from year 3 onwards. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association with cognitive wellbeing. Analyses adjusted for age, gender and level of education completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gps70163-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always listening to music, compared with never/rarely/sometimes, was associated with a 39% decreased risk of dementia (95% CI = 0.45,0.82, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001), and a 17% decreased risk of CIND (95% CI = 0.74, 0.92, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Playing an instrument (often/always) was associated with a 35% decreased dementia risk only (95% CI = 0.42,0.99, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.047). Participants who both listened to and played music had a 33% decreased dementia risk (95% CI = 0.51,0.89, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006) and a 22% decreased CIND risk (95% CI = 0.65,0.92, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always listening to music was associated with better global cognition and memory over time (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, respectively), but not the other cognitive domains. Engagement in music-related activities was not associated with changes in subjective cognitive wellbeing. In general, findings were stronger in individuals with over 16 years of education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gps70163-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight music as a potential promising, accessible strategy to help reduce cognitive impairment and delay the onset of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 18:47:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE4wc1VzUXlYVGFIVDBCcUwxWkVJS3E5TXBqZmdOY05nWTdkZzdhaElzbnhvZTlEZXNBY2pjVm5iYmtBYU5XajBpZnYxMzEwVUhQdVN3RXhvWFY3U3R5Z2JfdWlpeWlHQUE</guid></item><item><title>镁，神话或奇迹：它能修复您的睡眠，压力和消化吗？ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/magnesium-myth-or-miracle-can-it-fix-your-sleep-stress-and-digestion/articleshow/124832057.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast scroll-feed of 2025, one mineral has suddenly become a hot topic: magnesium. On TikTok and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/instagram" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reels, creators with soft lighting and soothing voices whisper about “mag glycinate before bed”, swipe supplements across wellness shelves and tag #magnesium, #sleepaid, #guthealth in posts that rack up hundreds of thousands of views. Welcome to the era of sleep-hacks meeting supplement culture, yet beneath the cinematic glow of pills and promises lies a more complex reality. Can this ubiquitous mineral genuinely reduce insomnia, stress and digestive woes? Or is it another viral health craze dressed in scientific jargon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ancient remedies meet modern magnesium pills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium’s story is not new. Ancient healers recognised the value of mineral-rich springs – for example the Epsom mineral baths in England (magnesium sulphate) – as remedies for aches, restlessness and sluggish bowels. These traditional practices flagged the mineral’s role long before quantified research existed. Fast-forward to today and the same essential element, involved in hundreds of enzymatic processes in the body, is being repositioned through sleek bottles and influencer tutorials. The mainstreaming of magnesium reflects both a surge in wellness culture and a growing awareness of how modern diet and lifestyle may leave key nutrients behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The social media explosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll through TikTok or Instagram and you will quickly encounter videos of young adults showing off their “night-time routine” – a magnesium glycinate pill, low-lighting, bathroom mirror shot, and the caption: “Slept straight through for the first time in years. Health outlets report that videos with the hashtag #magnesium on TikTok exceed a billion views, and that magnesium-serum or spray routines are trending. While this level of exposure drives consumer interest, several dietitians caution that online posts often oversell the benefits and understate the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the science actually says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12412596/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Magnesium Bisglycinate Supplementation in Healthy Adults Reporting Poor Sleep: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial by Schuster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; enrolled 155 adults aged 18-65 with self-reported poor sleep quality. Participants took 250 mg elemental magnesium (as magnesium bisglycinate) daily for four weeks. The magnesium group had a greater reduction in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores compared to placebo (-3.9 vs -2.3). The effect size was small (Cohen’s d ≈ 0.2) and benefits were stronger in participants who had low magnesium intake at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A systematic review, The Role of Magnesium in Sleep Health: A Systematic Review of Available Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; participants across nine studies and concluded that while magnesium status was associated with sleep quality, randomized clinical trials showed inconsistent results and more long-term research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-away: If you are deficient in magnesium, supplementation might help sleep. But for healthy adults with adequate intake, benefits are far from guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stress and mood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is essential to nerve signalling, GABA-receptor activation and regulation of the stress hormone cortisol. A review, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38817505/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Examining the Effects of Supplemental Magnesium on Self-Reported Anxiety and Sleep Quality &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; concluded that supplemental magnesium is “likely useful” for mild anxiety and insomnia, particularly in those with low baseline magnesium status. However the heterogeneity of studies (different formulations, doses, populations) limits firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-away: Magnesium might support mood and stress when there is a shortfall, but it is not a stand-alone anxiety treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Digestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the evidence is stronger but very specific. Magnesium salts such as magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate are employed as osmotic laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38817505/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A randomized controlled study, Magnesium Oxide in Constipation: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that magnesium oxide improved stool frequency and consistency and reduced colonic transit time in patients with mild to moderate constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cross-sectional study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925793/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Association of Dietary Magnesium Intake with Chronic Constipation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that higher dietary magnesium intake was inversely associated with the presence of chronic constipation in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-away: For digestive sluggishness or occasional constipation, certain magnesium forms may work – but they are essentially medicinal rather than general wellness picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much to take, and how&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Diet first:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the National Health Service (NHS) UK guideline, adult men (19–64 years) need around 300 mg magnesium per day, and adult women need around 270 mg. The best way to meet this is through food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium-rich foods include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens such as spinach, kale and Swiss chard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds such as almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds and chia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains including whole-wheat bread, brown rice, oats and quinoa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes such as black beans, lentils and chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocados, bananas and dried fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatty fish like mackerel and salmon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a handful of pumpkin seeds (28 g) can contain more than 150 mg magnesium, which is over half the recommended daily intake for many adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplement dose: Most trials used around 250–500 mg elemental magnesium per day, often in specific forms. For instance, the Schuster (2025) sleep study used 250 mg daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upper limit: UK guidance advises that more than 400 mg per day from supplements can cause diarrhoea, and there is limited evidence about the safety of consistently high supplemental doses. Some European guidelines recommend not exceeding 250 mg magnesium per day from supplements alone, excluding dietary intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Form matters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycinate/bisglycinate – gentle on the stomach, commonly used for sleep and mood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citrate or hydroxide – stronger bowel effect, suitable for constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxide – lower absorption, often cheaper but more likely to cause loose stools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Evening dosing is common for sleep support, but consistency is more important than exact timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactions and caution: Magnesium can interfere with iron, zinc, calcium and certain antibiotics. People with kidney disease or taking laxatives should seek medical advice. Official British guidelines for hypomagnesaemia specify monitoring levels and individualising doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is magnesium myth or miracle? More nuance than hype. It is a legitimate nutrient whose deficiency can cause problems and whose supplementation may help in specific cases (such as poor sleep when intake is low, or constipation). But it is not a miracle cure for everyone. If your diet is poor, you are stressed, sleep deprived and you are not getting enough magnesium, then a well-chosen supplement might help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already eat well, sleep fairly, and take care of lifestyle basics, then the benefits will likely be modest. The social media boom around magnesium reflects genuine interest – but science says: check your intake, meet your food first, pick the right form, follow guideline-based dosing, and stay realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Consider this the general human tendency of hoping "All is Well" until it isn't. When it comes to fatal diseases such as cancer, most symptoms often go ignored until the situation worsens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Cancer Institute's &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, 2,041,910 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2025 with an elevated number of young patients. With breast and colorectal cancer being some of the most common cases, more and more people have been worried about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle choices and environmental surroundings along with genetics form the fatal triangle of causes for the disease, being alert about its symptoms can impact the diagnosis and treatment positively.

What is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a TikTok user explained on the social media platform, along with common symptoms like sudden weight loss and diarrhoea, she noticed that her stools were thinner than normal. Assuming that it was irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), she didn't visit a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she did, the condition had progressed to stage 4 colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Narrow stools: A waving red flag?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Why does this happen? Well, the symptoms occur if tumours are present near the end of the colon or line the inside of it, narrowing whatever the stool passes through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Doctor or no doctor?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

While any noticeable change in the bowel habits is concerning, that's not always the case. Changes in stool shape or consistency could also be the result of going to the bathroom more or less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pencil-thin poop is a rare sign of colorectal cancer but "when it exists, it is highly concerning," said Cecchini. More common signs include blood in the stool, abdominal pain and sudden weight loss. Sometimes, there can be no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experiencing any of these symptoms must prompt a doctor's visit. “It’s very easy in younger individuals to think, ‘Oh, it’s just haemorrhoids,’ or something like that ... and it may be, but also those things can coexist,” said Cecchini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, getting a colonoscopy or colorectal cancer screening is advised to lower the risk or catch the disease in its early stages.

You can even go and sit in an infrared sauna, where instead of hot coals (real or electric) heating the air, your body is warmed directly by infrared light. According to its devotees, it’s like bathing in one of those LED-lit beauty masks, boosting skin collagen, relaxing muscles, relieving inflammation and chronic health conditions while protecting against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It sounds a bit like witchcraft,” says Paul Chazot, professor in neuroscience at Durham University and a convert to the value of light therapy following 20 years of research in the field. Of course, some of light’s effects on our bodies are well established. Sunlight helps us make vitamin D, needed for bone health, immunity, muscles and more. Sunlight regulates our circadian rhythms, too, triggering the release of neurochemicals and hormones while we are awake, and winding down bodily functions for sleep as it fades into night. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/29/best-sunrise-alarm-clocks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sunlight-imitating lamps&lt;/a&gt; are a common remedy for people with seasonal affective disorder (Sad) to boost low mood in winter. So there’s no doubt we need light energy to function well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While Sad lamps tend to use a mixture of light frequencies from the blue end of the spectrum, most other light therapy devices deploy red or infrared light. In serious clinical research, such as Chazot’s investigations into the effects of infrared on brain cells (more on which, later), finding the right frequency is key. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which runs the spectrum from the lowest-energy, longest wavelengths (radio waves) to the highest-energy (gamma waves). Phototherapy, or light therapy, uses wavelengths around the middle of this spectrum, the highest energy of those being invisible ultraviolet, then visible light (all the colours we see in a rainbow) and then infrared (which we can see with night-vision goggles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UV light has been used by medical dermatologists for many years to treat chronic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis and vitiligo. It works on the immune system within cells, “and dampens down inflammation,” says Dr Bernard Ho at the British Association of Dermatologists. “There’s lots of evidence for phototherapy.” UVA goes deeper into the skin than UVB, whereas the LEDs we see on consumer light-therapy devices (which generally deliver red, infrared or blue light) “tend to be a bit more superficial”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="77046311-888a-4853-9fbb-7e2031a24799" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;An infrared light-therapy bed. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: O2O Creative/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The side-effects of UVB exposure, such as burning or tanning, are well known but in medical devices the light is delivered in a “narrow-band” form – meaning smaller wavelengths – which minimises the risks. “It’s supervised by a healthcare professional, so the dosage is monitored,” says Ho. And crucially, the lightbulbs are calibrated by medical technicians, “to ensure that the wavelength that’s being delivered is fit for purpose – unlike in tanning salons, where it’s a bit unregulated, and we don’t really know what wavelengths are being used”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Red and blue LEDs, he says, “aren’t really used in the medical sense, but they may help with certain conditions”. Red LEDs, it is proposed, help boost blood circulation, oxygen uptake and cell renewal in the skin, and stimulate collagen production – a key aspiration in anti-ageing effects. “The evidence is there,” says Ho. “Although it’s not strong.” In any case, amid the sea of devices now available, “we don’t know whether or not the lights emitted are reflective of the research that has been done. We don’t know the duration, how close the lights should be to the skin, whether or not that will increase the risk versus the benefit. There are lots of questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the earliest blue-light products targeted &lt;em&gt;Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ibacterium acnes&lt;/em&gt;, a microbe associated with acne. The evidence for its efficacy isn’t strong enough for it to be routinely prescribed by doctors – although, says Ho, “it’s often seen in medical spas or aesthetics practices”. Some of his patients use it as part of their routine, he says, but if they’re buying a device for home use, “we just tell them to try it carefully and to make sure it has been assessed for safety. Unless it’s a medical device, the regulation is a bit grey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="193df11d-b9f8-4cd6-aaa3-17b95cf52564" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;An LED light anti-ageing mask.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, in a far-flung field of pioneering medical science, Chazot has been experimenting with brain cells, identifying a number of ways in which infrared can boost cellular health. “Pretty much everything I did with the light at that particular wavelength was positive and protective,” he says. It is partly these many and varied positive effects on cellular health that have driven scepticism about light therapy – that it’s too good to be true. But his research has thoroughly changed his mind in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chazot mostly works on developing drug treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, but over 20 years ago, a GP who was developing an antiviral light treatment for cold sores sought his expertise as a biologist. “He created some devices so that we could work with them with cells and with fruit flies,” he says. “I was pretty sceptical. It was an unusual wavelength of about 1070 nanometres, that nobody believed did anything biological.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What it did have going for it, though, was that it travelled through water easily, meaning it could penetrate the body more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More evidence was emerging at the time that infrared light targeted the mitochondria in cells. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells, generating energy for them to function. “Every cell in your body has mitochondria, including the brain,” says Chazot, who, as a neuroscientist, decided to focus the research on brain cells. “It has been shown that in humans this light therapy increases blood flow into the brain, which is always very good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With 1070 treatment, mitochondria also produce a small amount of a molecule known as reactive oxygen species. In low doses this substance, says Chazot, “stimulates so-called chaperone proteins which look after your mitochondria, look after your cells and also deal with the unwanted proteins”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of these mechanisms appear promising for treating a brain disease: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-autophagy – autophagy being the process the cell uses to clear unwanted damaging proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1f30e433-9af6-43f9-bc8b-a3310dd1f936" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A beauty therapist administering blue-light therapy on a teenage boy.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Constantinis/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The last time Chazot checked the literature on using the 1070 wavelength on human dementia patients, he says, about 400 people were taking part in four studies, including &lt;a href="https://www.aginganddisease.org/EN/10.14336/AD.2021.0229" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his own initial clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alzheimer’s Society describes research into light therapy as &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/treatments/alternative-therapies/light-therapy-and-dementia" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“promising”&lt;/a&gt;. However, it adds: “The research is still in its infancy and there is now not enough evidence to recommend using light therapy as an intervention in dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One area where professionals have largely ditched light therapy is physiotherapy, according to Lucy Macdonald, a physiotherapist &lt;a href="https://restartphysio.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;working in Surrey&lt;/a&gt;. Not that this stops high-end gyms and consumer devices offering red-light and laser therapy to aid muscle recovery and reduce musculoskeletal aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Special red and infrared lasers, it has been claimed, could cause micro-injuries deep into cartilage and help it regrow. “It was considered that lower frequency levels would penetrate deeper,” says Macdonald. “Even when I first qualified, about 25 years ago, it was still being used. But no one uses it now for deep tissues like cartilage. It can be helpful and is still used for superficial lesions, wound healing and that sort of thing, hence where you get the overlap with the beauty industry. But for deep applications, there’s no evidence to show that it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The studies behind the claims that it can heal deep tissue are not randomised control trials, she says. “They’ll take two subject groups, and they’ll do a different type of laser on both of them, and then they’ll look at the outcomes of those two, but they’re not controlling it against no treatment. And obviously the body has an innate healing ability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A few decades ago, she recalls, “people would go to the physio, be strapped up to a machine, press the button and off you go”. The placebo effect should never be underestimated, she says: “During that laser session, you’ve been talking to a physio, the problem’s been validated. You’ve got reduced fear levels. You feel more nurtured, and you’re ready to then go and be more active and move more and all the things that we know actually do help with cartilage issues – but it’s not the laser. Because when they control for the laser, it’s not shown to be effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She says that if she or anyone in her family had cartilage issues, she wouldn’t waft a laser over it. “Nowadays there’s so many other highly effective treatments with decent evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What about the full-body beds studded with red LEDs now available in swanky gyms, and the expensive body mats for sale online, promising to aid muscle recovery? Macdonald can’t find any clinical studies to support their claims. “The best thing people can do to aid muscle recovery,” she says, “is keep moving because this maintains good circulation, eat healthily so that you’ve got all the building blocks for repair, and sleep.” Healing peaks during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Similarly, Ho wouldn’t necessarily recommend LED products for the skin, although he suspects the risks are minimal if used as directed. “What overdoing it would probably mean is exerting too much heat on the skin, which can induce either pigmentation or even more inflammation in the skin. So there’s some concerns around the use of these products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="492bce74-80b4-48fe-9f2f-c3345251d54f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A man using an LED therapy mask at home. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But even Ho has been tempted to try one. “It is kind of fun to use. I used it for a bit of brightening, a bit of anti-pigmentation. Mine has different modes to it, but I have to remind myself that it’s not a medical treatment. I think if you go in with the mindset that it’s a splurge, a fun treat to yourself … but I would avoid overuse, and use as it’s directed.” If you can afford it, you may, he says, “in theory have some nice-looking effects, even if it’s short-lived. If it gives you a little boost, or if it makes you feel a bit better, why not? But don’t rely on it as a holy grail.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In aesthetic dermatology practises, says Ho, LEDs are used to reduce some of the side-effects from other treatments that can cause inflammation, such as peels or injections. “The idea is the LED light will help reduce some of that downtime.” Professional or medical-grade equipment should have a CE marking, denoting higher standards of testing than with over-the-counter versions. Still, he says, “the evidence on exactly how much to use it, and at what frequency, is still slightly guesswork. Even if you’re using a medical device, it will depend on the device itself and what the manufacturers’ recommendations are based on their testing.” We also don’t know which, if any, beauty products might reduce or enhance their efficacy, and whether treatment should be before or after applying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The jury also remains out for the new red-light toothbrush, or the myriad other glowing devices you can buy to fix gum disease. The British Dental Association says this is such a young field its experts aren’t yet in a position to assist. As with so many other consumer light-therapy products, while they could theoretically help reduce inflammation and boost cellular health, in terms of their efficacy and safety we remain largely in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxNejhMV2ZmbFdxaGdLUFo0bEhWYnJ1RTg2QmZVeFJCdEJ4WkZyXzBIYUEtWkFhV1RvdHF3a3g3STktd25EUGJnUG9qQkJTdVk4UGNwczJoQW1xNGpKSlpUOVc0b08xM3JIdlRxNE5DbDdEYVBqSDN5ZzhSaVhlR3Qwbmx4c08zVFZ3a0VTOTJxNG9OdXdNRUJtTnNBd0VQakJMby1Cd251RmFfenRIeUx5M3l0QnZHVUNHZVdoU2QxOEY5Z0pWN0Y4YVlmTllNUWxSNC1veU1kWlpBS0JyeHRxcUZjNA</guid></item><item><title>50年之谜解开？科学家揭开精神分裂症患者“听到声音”的原因- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/50-year-old-mystery-solved-scientists-uncover-why-people-with-schizophrenia-hear-voices/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 15:41:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNSDdudVNfcjRIbFJscG9LTTh0dXRFMm9DWkhELXBNNXhjM0lqTUdDQThKRnJWUWQ0MkNRWnlBSmZMblhyWmtoVFBPWmJVQ19IYzFyd0tKRmg4amJLaEs4aGFWZEMzN2pwUTVsd0R5T01WWHBJa20xaFFBQkhtWWkxRGNSdWpDUmttaVpDS09hZU9HYmpVODlPcWp3Tm1relVzdC0zUXU2WmtnbFdkaXVLWkZtNA</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，大脑自身可实时转换为节奏- Dallas Express</title><link>https://dallasexpress.com/health/needs-photo-study-reveals-brain-rewires-itself-to-rhythm-in-real-time/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="cutline"&gt;

Slower waves also synced with faster ones through “cross-frequency coupling,” &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/music-actively-reshapes-the-brain-in-real-time-study-finds/"&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt; sound to memory or emotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1g7jtus r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt;“We are used to thinking of brainwaves like fixed stations — alpha, beta, gamma — and of brain anatomy as a set of distinct regions,” said Dr. Mattia Rosso, a lead researcher, Neuroscience News &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/rhythm-brain-network-29184/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “But what we see with FREQ-NESS is much richer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1x3r274 r-p1pxzi"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt;The team compared brain activity at rest to activity during the tone. Resting brains showed intricate patterns, but the rhythm triggered new networks, weakened some, and moved others, like those for vision or thought. The top 10 brainwave patterns confirmed these shifts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1g7jtus r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The brain does not just react: it reconfigures. And now we can see it,”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/rhythm-brain-network-29184/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Professor Leonardo Bonetti, co-author from Aarhus and Oxford, per Neuroscience News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1g7jtus r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt;Unlike past methods that grouped brainwaves into broad categories, FREQ-NESS analyzes precise frequencies, offering clearer insights into overlapping signals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1g7jtus r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt; “We have designed a method that finds how each frequency is expressed across the brain,” Rosso &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/rhythm-brain-network-29184/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, Neuroscience News reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad post-ad"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="172894" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1g7jtus r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The approach could transform neuroscience, aiding research into epilepsy, depression, or brain-computer interfaces.&lt;/strong&gt; A global program now aims to expand its use, potentially enabling personalized brain mapping for mental health or education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1x3r274 r-p1pxzi"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1x3r274"&gt;“This could change how we study brain responses to music and beyond, including consciousness, mind-wandering, and broader interactions with the external world,” Bonetti said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner runs late by a few minutes, and suddenly, the whole household feels the tension — at least according to Hudson. In a video shared by @hudsonbegood, the usually cheery NYC &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; trades his sunny smile for a stare so intense it could make even the most confident pet parent crumble. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video starts off innocent enough — Hudson sitting pretty, blinking sweetly at the camera while the on-screen text reads, “Golden Retrievers are the happiest, most non-judgmental dogs except…” Cue the dramatic cut to him channeling pure betrayal over dinner being two minutes and thirty-three seconds late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-s-reaction-to-slightly-late-dinner-is-super-funny"&gt;Golden Retriever’s reaction to slightly late dinner is super funny&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson starts the reel looking like the picture of patience. He’s posing for the camera, smiling and blinking blissfully. However, the video then cuts to a shot of him sulking. Once he realizes his bowl isn’t where it should be, things take a turn. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Golden Retriever sits in the hallway, completely still, giving his human what can only be described as the most judgmental side eye. You can literally feel the chill from the other side of the screen. His expression says everything — “I’ve been wronged, and I will remember this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the camera zooms in, it’s even more intense. That single eye, laser-focused, could put any Oscar winner to shame. The caption sums it up perfectly: “The most serious side eye.” The Golden Retriever breed is famously serious about food. Hudson, in particular, has a strong appreciation for snacks, even stalking his &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/182101-golden-retriever-toddler-share-snacks-instagram-video"&gt;little human brother&lt;/a&gt; whenever he is eating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fans couldn’t get enough. “Goldens have perfected the side eye,” one commenter wrote. Another added the correct schedule, “Late is VERY late. Right on time is borderline late. Be early Mom!” And yet another hilariously observed, “One eye is on the food container, the other is on YOU.” With over 13.6K likes, it’s safe to say the internet is loving this little tardy drama — Hudson might forgive, but he never forgets when dinner’s delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="331e4ae2-9510-4799-b44d-c353bdd49522"&gt;Like many first-time mothers, Lisette Lopez-Rose thought childbirth would usher in a time of joy. Instead, she had panic attacks as she imagined that something bad was going to happen to her baby, and she felt weighed down by a sadness that wouldn't lift. The San Francisco Bay Area mother knew her extreme emotions weren't normal, but she was afraid to tell her obstetrician. What if they took her baby away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At about six months postpartum, she discovered an online network of women with similar experiences and ultimately opened up to her primary care doctor. "About two months after I started medication, I started to feel like I was coming out of a deep hole and seeing light again," she says. Today, Lopez-Rose works at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://postpartum.net/about-psi/" target="_blank" data-url="https://postpartum.net/about-psi/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Postpartum Support International&lt;/a&gt;, coordinating volunteers to help new mothers form online connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="331e4ae2-9510-4799-b44d-c353bdd49522-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;About one in eight US women go through a period of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/postpartum-depression" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/postpartum-depression"&gt;postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt;, making it among the most common complications of childbirth. It &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/postpartum-depression" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/postpartum-depression" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;typically occurs in the first few weeks after delivery&lt;/a&gt;, when there's a sudden drop in the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone. As scientists unravel chemical and genetic changes caused by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2022/when-depression-sneaks-menopause" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2022/when-depression-sneaks-menopause" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;those shifting hormones&lt;/a&gt;, they are discovering new ways to diagnose and treat postpartum depression, and even ways to identify who is at risk for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="743303f4-1fdb-415d-b49e-a1d1f2ed6374"&gt;The first-ever drug for postpartum depression, containing a derivative of progesterone, received US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2019. That marked a new approach to the disorder. This winter, in another major advance, a San Diego-based startup company will launch a blood test that predicts a pregnant woman's risk of postpartum depression with more than 80 percent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product, called myLuma, will be the first commercially available test to use biomarkers — molecules in the body, in this case the blood — to predict onset of a psychiatric disorder, much in the way that blood tests can detect signs of diseases like cancer and diabetes. Pregnant women who learn they are at risk for postpartum depression could take preventive steps such as taking antidepressants after childbirth or arranging for extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood test could reduce the stigma that keeps many women from seeking help, says Jennifer Payne, a reproductive psychiatrist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and a lead investigator on the studies that led to the new test. She is a founder and member of the scientific advisory board for the company that makes myLuma, Dionysus Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we have a blood test, it brings psychiatry down to the level of biology, which I think your average person can understand as something that needs treatment and that isn't just in somebody's head," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-etLnbmM54Mj7MVDcGGW3yY" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-etLnbmM54Mj7MVDcGGW3yY slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="d84c2056-80cc-45dc-8d17-8f3a34adb464"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The hormones estradiol (the main form of estrogen) and progesterone rise during pregnancy.

That led her to a key question: Why does the sudden drop in hormones after childbirth greatly affect some women but not others? While it's not uncommon for women to experience transient feelings of anxiety and sadness within days of giving birth, only in some does &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;a deeper and more persistent depression take hold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="0bcde090-e51f-477c-a637-2b53b3eb0296"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Lisette Lopez-Rose overcame her postpartum depression and now helps to coordinate support groups through Postpartum Support International.

Kaminsky is an epigeneticist: He researches how small chemicals called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2025/epigenetic-clock-can-help-save-wildlife" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2025/epigenetic-clock-can-help-save-wildlife" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;methyl groups can attach to genes&lt;/a&gt; and affect how active they are. Environmental factors from pollution to nutrition can affect the extent of this reversible methylation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing female mice given high levels of estrogen to those without it, Kaminsky found that estrogen caused specific gene methylation patterns inside cells in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2025/memory-formation-long-term-potentiation" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2025/memory-formation-long-term-potentiation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain that helps control mood. Those findings suggested what to look for in blood samples Payne had collected from 51 women with a history of mood disorders. The women had been tracked throughout their pregnancies and afterward, with some developing postpartum depression within four weeks of childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two estrogen-sensitive genes emerged from the research — &lt;em&gt;HP1BP3&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;TTC9B&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039252/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039252/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;More than 80 percent of the women&lt;/a&gt; who had postpartum depression showed a distinctive pattern of greater methylation on one gene and less methylation on the other. What's more, the changes in the genes could be detected throughout each trimester of pregnancy, says Kaminsky, now at the University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health Research at the Royal; he also is a cofounder of Dionysus. In other words, even early in pregnancy, Kaminsky says, "you can predict the women that are going to get postpartum depression."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaminsky, Payne and collaborators repeatedly replicated those findings. As reported in a 2016 paper&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7872514999576100431&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnpp2015333&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fnew-blood-test-can-predict-risk-of-postpartum-depression-with-more-than-80-percent-accuracy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2015333" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnpp2015333&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fnew-blood-test-can-predict-risk-of-postpartum-depression-with-more-than-80-percent-accuracy" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they found that through the methylation patterns of those genes, they could correctly predict more than 80 percent of the cases of postpartum depression in 240 pregnant women who had no history of psychiatric disorders. In another collaboration published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7702696/#R18" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7702696/#R18" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2020 in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at Johns Hopkins, Emory University and the University of California, Irvine, including Payne and Kaminsky, tested blood samples from 285 pregnant women and also confirmed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That epigenetic research forms the basis of the myLuma test, which also incorporates additional biomarkers that improve its accuracy, says Kaminsky. Beginning in January 2026, it is expected to become available at some doctors' offices in three states: Florida, Texas and California. Though it isn't yet FDA-approved, doctors are permitted to use such lab tests to help make clinical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-c95d8e0e-efc9-41c4-8b37-173dba20caa2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="zeroing-in-on-steroids-3"&gt;Zeroing in on steroids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3286f473-7689-497e-8ea4-c65741f021f8"&gt;Not everyone with postpartum depression has these epigenetic changes, so Payne and other researchers continue to hunt for other biomarkers to understand how hormonal changes trigger postpartum depression. They are zeroing in, for example, on neuroactive steroids, which the body makes from molecules like progesterone in the brain and other tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those metabolites, called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5420429/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5420429/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;allopregnanolone, has a calming effect&lt;/a&gt; — it affects a receptor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the brain called GABA-A, which is known to be involved in stress reduction. Allopregnanolone rises during pregnancy and drops swiftly after delivery. Another neuroactive steroid, pregnanolone, has similar properties. A third, isoallopregnanolone, tamps down the antidepressant effect of allopregnanolone, increasing feelings of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of 136 pregnant women published in 2025 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, women with an imbalance in pregnanolone and isoallopregnanolone during pregnancy &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8949103154219264715&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41386-025-02052-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fnew-blood-test-can-predict-risk-of-postpartum-depression-with-more-than-80-percent-accuracy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02052-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41386-025-02052-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fnew-blood-test-can-predict-risk-of-postpartum-depression-with-more-than-80-percent-accuracy" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;were more likely to develop postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt;. Measuring the ratio of these chemicals in the blood could be another way to predict postpartum depression, says reproductive psychiatrist Lauren M. Osborne of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who co-led the study with Payne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allopregnanolone, meanwhile, has already proved to be a valuable tool for treatment. A synthetic version called brexanolone was developed by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Sage Therapeutics and FDA-approved in 2019 — the first drug approved specifically for postpartum depression. Originally provided via IV infusion, it has been replaced by an oral version, zuranolone, which was FDA-approved in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b4d98843-a17b-471d-b7cf-01f79768f285"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we have a blood test, it brings psychiatry down to the level of biology, which I think your average person can understand as something that needs treatment and that isn’t just in somebody’s head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jennifer Payne, University of Virginia in Charlottesville&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="8d7255f9-b9b9-4c20-83e6-b9d2544e36f9"&gt;These are "transformative therapies" because they work rapidly, write the authors of a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-med-050423-095712#right-ref-B17" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-med-050423-095712#right-ref-B17" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2025 article in the &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Women at high risk of postpartum depression might even benefit from proactively taking zuranolone, though that hasn't yet been tested, says article coauthor Samantha Meltzer-Brody, a reproductive psychiatrist at the University of North Carolina who was an academic principal investigator in studies of brexanolone and an investigator in zuranolone trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of a blood test, she adds, "opens up that entire line of questioning on how do you get ahead of it, so you don't have to wait until someone starts suffering?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other possible targets for a postpartum depression test. In a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36138128/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36138128/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2022 article in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Sarven Sabunciyan, with Osborne, Payne and Morgan Sherer, then an immunologist at Johns Hopkins, described a small study in which the types of RNA carried through blood in fatty bubbles were different in women who developed postpartum depression — both in pregnancy and afterwards. In particular, there was a decrease in kinds of RNA related to autophagy — the cleansing of debris from cells. Autophagy has been linked to other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another potential lead, Eynav Accortt, a clinical psychologist specializing in perinatal mental health at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, found a pattern of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/protein-biomarkers-identified-in-women-who-developed-perinatal-depression-and-anxiety/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/protein-biomarkers-identified-in-women-who-developed-perinatal-depression-and-anxiety/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;altered proteins in plasma samples&lt;/a&gt; of women who developed perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, a group of conditions that includes postpartum depression. This included proteins involved in neuron function and in inflammation, which &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/posts/2021/may/inflammation-is-a-core-feature-of-depression-new-evidence-from-large-scale-study/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/posts/2021/may/inflammation-is-a-core-feature-of-depression-new-evidence-from-large-scale-study/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;is known to play a role in depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to explore these possibilities, Payne is leading a large clinical trial that will provide more detailed information on the predictive value of the myLuma test. For example, it will explore the rates of false positives (women who are identified as at-risk who do not develop postpartum depression) and false negatives (women who develop postpartum depression but weren't identified by the test). That is a necessary step toward FDA approval, which could make the test available directly to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="33930f1b-0354-4e53-8ac1-7128cd3b562b"&gt;Lopez-Rose remembers how scared she felt in the months after her daughter was born. In those dark times, she quit her job, barely slept and was overwhelmed by negative thoughts. She had many self-doubts, but she now knows that reaching out for help was a sign that she was a good mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, her daughter is four — and thriving, as is Lopez-Rose. But a blood test, she says, would have warned her of what to look out for, "instead of it being so shocking when I was going through my depression."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit publication dedicated to making scientific knowledge accessible to all. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/newsletter-signup" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/newsletter-signup" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for Knowable Magazine’s newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Erectile dysfunction is often overlooked as a symptom, but it can serve as an early warning signal that something may be wrong with your cardiovascular system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;“The second potential early sign is experiencing shortness of breath during mild activity,” he continues. “If climbing a few stairs or doing light &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/exercise" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; leaves you unusually winded, especially if accompanied by chest discomfort or angina, it’s a signal that your heart may be struggling. This is a symptom that should never be ignored, as it could indicate reduced heart efficiency or early stages of coronary artery disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is swelling in feet and ankles a hidden red flag&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lastly, swelling in the feet, ankles, or lower legs can indicate heart failure or kidney dysfunction,” Dr DiNicolantonio warns. “Fluid retention is a common but often overlooked symptom of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/risk-factors-behind-increasing-cardiovascular-issues-in-india-tips-to-safeguard-your-heart-health-101693660491172.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiovascular issues"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt;. Persistent swelling should prompt immediate medical evaluation to rule out underlying heart or kidney problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr DiNicolantonio concludes, “Recognising these subtle, early signs can make a significant difference in preventing severe cardiovascular events. Early intervention, lifestyle modifications, and medical guidance are crucial.

These particular vectors have become &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0060874" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. because warmer winters have been hospitable to their eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The woman described experiencing intense joint pain, a common symptom of chikungunya. She said it felt like her feet, ankles, wrists, hands, and shoulders were being pulled apart, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is chikungunya concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya has not been documented as locally transmitted in the U.S. for about a decade, according to the Times. However, warmer weather across the country has attracted mosquitoes carrying various diseases. Unusually high winter temperatures have also extended mosquito season, which can create and prolong disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not only does human activity impact the planet, but it also impacts our health. The pollution we create, whether that's in landfills or through dirty energy usage, contributes to heat-trapping gases in our atmosphere. This creates warmer weather that allows disease-carrying vectors to become acclimated to new areas. As a result, people can become exposed to illnesses like chikungunya, which is potentially disabling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about chikungunya?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because of how excruciating chikungunya can be, it's important to prevent and monitor its spread. The disease hasn't become a major public health issue in the United States. A Department of Health spokesperson told the Times that transmission remains low. One expert shared insight on how a vector carrying chikungunya may have made its way to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Mosquitoes are sometimes carried back in luggage or in airplanes," Dr. Bruce Farber, an infectious disease expert at Northwell Health, told the Times&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, the infected woman wanted to share her story to raise awareness about the possible presence of chikungunya. She did not travel outside of the country recently, so she would not have known to check for the disease. Her experience reinforces that people experiencing symptoms and doctors should continue to screen for the illness to track its transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, individuals can do their part to cut back on the harmful pollution that warms the planet.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jennifer Aniston adds egg whites to her oatmeal for extra protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One large egg white has about four grams of protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other ways to add protein to oatmeal include milk, yogurt and nut butter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Actress Jennifer Aniston has always been on trend. Whether it’s her hair, her projects or her food, she’s elegant and ahead of her time. While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/2058625/high-protein-dinner-plan/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein meals&lt;/a&gt; are all the rage now, Aniston has been upping her protein all along, as revealed in an interview to &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/beauty/health-fitness/a35335/jennifer-aniston-beauty-interview-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. Case in point: Aniston adds &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/joy-bauers-protein-packed-oatmeal-is-perfect-for-busy-mornings-8709502" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;egg whites to her oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. While a lot has changed since 2016, we think this breakfast hack might be timeless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; star wakes up, her morning routine involves &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291947/the-benefits-of-warm-lemon-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lemon water first thing&lt;/a&gt;. For breakfast, she chooses between a shake, avocado and eggs, puffed millet cereal with banana or oatmeal with a whipped egg white
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of her choices, the oatmeal upgrade stood out to us immediately. “Right before [the oatmeal] is finished cooking, you just whip in an egg white and it kind of gives it this fluffy texture that's delicious," Aniston explained to &lt;em&gt;Elle&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s probably safe to assume Aniston is cooking her oats on the stovetop and not in the microwave when she adds in the egg. Depending on the egg, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7905415/are-egg-whites-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-says/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;most egg whites have about three to four grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; and minimal fat, unlike a whole egg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With very little carbs and sodium, an egg white is an easy way to dial up protein without dialing up much else—which means it can work in plenty of other dishes, too. Plus, whipping it up beforehand, as Aniston does, makes it even easier to fold into the oatmeal for an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/10-minute-breakfast-recipes-with-5-ingredients-or-less-8700312" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy breakfast solution&lt;/a&gt;.

		&lt;p&gt;France’s 60 Millions de consommateurs has tested popular extra-virgin oils and raised a red flag. The magazine says several bottles carried contaminants linked to plastic packaging and processing. The alert targets a short list of brands, and it asks regular users to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the consumer tests found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine reviewed 24 well-known extra-virgin olive oils sold in French supermarkets. Most met expectations on taste and basic quality markers. Concerns emerged when lab screens looked for unwanted chemicals. The tests picked up traces of plasticizers and mineral oil hydrocarbons in many samples, with a handful showing higher levels than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine reports elevated levels of two phthalates — DEHP and DBP — in four extra-virgin references, and urges shoppers to steer clear of those batches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasticizers can migrate from certain packaging or processing materials. Mineral oils can come from lubricants, inks, or transport materials. Even tiny amounts raise questions, because olive oil dissolves lipophilic molecules easily. Regular users face repeated exposure over time, which can lift the total dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why plasticizers land in oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive oil is a fatty matrix. It pulls in chemicals that prefer fat over water. When oil sits in soft plastics, or passes through tubing and seals that contain phthalates, some of those molecules can move into the liquid. Storage heat speeds that process. So do long shelf times and light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phthalates like DEHP and DBP are regulated in the EU and flagged as endocrine disruptors with potential reproductive effects at certain exposure levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mineral oil hydrocarbons have another path. They can drip from machinery grease. They can rub off from recycled cardboard or printed packaging. Some lots show more than others, which points to equipment, logistics, and packaging choices rather than the olives themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The four brands flagged by the magazine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 60 Millions de consommateurs, these extra-virgin oils showed the highest phthalate levels in their panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Brand (as tested)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Issue reported by the magazine&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Naturalia Vierge Extra “Like a Virgin”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;La Vie Claire Vierge Extra&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Terra Delyssa Vierge Extra&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cauvin Bio “La Bio”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine stresses that many other products tested did not raise the same level of concern. Still, it advises heavy users to swap away from the four names above and to favor low-contaminant oils in glass. Results can vary by batch. A single bad lot does not define a brand forever, yet consumer pressure often speeds corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for your kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can lower your exposure without giving up olive oil’s benefits. Focus on packaging, storage, and how you shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick dark glass or metal tins, check harvest dates, and store cool and away from light. These three steps do most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose dark glass or tin over plastic. Fatty foods and plastic do not mix well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for “extra virgin,” “cold extraction,” and a harvest date. Fresher oil needs less aggressive processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep bottles in a cool, dark place. Heat and light speed chemical migration and oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy smaller formats if you cook rarely. An open bottle ages fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smell and taste before a big drizzle. Fresh oil smells green and fruity, with a light bitterness and a peppery finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to read an olive oil label&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels carry clues about both quality and risk. They also help you compare like-for-like products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality cues that matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Extra virgin” signals low free acidity (≤ 0.8 g/100 g) and no heat refining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country or region of origin gives traceability. Single-origin oils tend to be tighter controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvest year beats “best before” for freshness. Aim for the latest harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Varietal mention (e.g., Koroneiki, Picual) aligns flavor and stability with your cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protected designations (PDO/PGI) indicate rules on production and audits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What scientists say about risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context helps. Most tests find small amounts of contaminants in fatty foods. Risk depends on dose, frequency, and who is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phthalates and endocrine disruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEHP and DBP belong to a group linked to hormonal interference in animal and epidemiological studies. Regulators set strict migration limits for food contact materials in Europe. Infants, children, and people seeking pregnancy often sit at the center of precautionary advice. Cutting repeated low-level exposures across many sources — food, dust, packaging — reduces the overall load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mineral oil hydrocarbons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSH (saturated) can build up in the body over time. MOAH (aromatic) raises extra concern, as some fractions include genotoxic compounds. Modern labs can detect tiny traces. Food agencies urge manufacturers to curb sources by fixing packaging and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing contamination usually starts with packaging swaps, clean lubricants, tighter storage, and better supplier controls — changes consumers rarely see but benefit from quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why packaging and process matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft PVC and some flexible materials rely on plasticizers that can migrate into oil. Stainless steel, glass, and modern elastomers cut that risk. Recycled cardboard without functional barriers can release mineral oils. Ink set-offs from labels can migrate through plastic over time. Each small step in the chain matters: harvest crates, mills, pumps, tanks, fillers, caps, and pallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart buying without the stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need lab gear to shop smarter. Build a simple routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer glass. If you must buy plastic, use it quickly and store cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate brands that publish harvest dates and lot numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep one “finishing” oil for salads and a separate, sturdy oil (like Picual) for cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your store about storage conditions. Shelves away from windows serve you better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra context for frequent users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily users stack exposure from many fatty foods: dairy, spreads, nuts, sauces. Swapping one or two high-use items to glass-packed options cuts the total. If you cook for kids or pregnant people, prioritize dark glass bottles and fresh harvest oils. Stainless-steel bulk dispensers at reputable shops can also help, as long as they rotate stock fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about your household’s risk profile? Track your high-fat purchases for a week. Note which come in plastic. Shift the top two to glass or tins on your next run. That small change usually delivers the biggest reduction with almost no sacrifice in flavor or price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article reflects the findings reported by 60 Millions de consommateurs on a panel of 24 oils. Brands may vary by lot and date. If a producer updates packaging or process, results can change fast, so keep an eye on fresh test data when it appears.&lt;/p&gt;

The prolonged exposure to high sodium levels, results in damage to kidney tissues, which eventually reduces their operational capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who do not have diagnosed kidney problems, can develop problems from consuming excessive salt, because it leads to fluid buildup in the body, and disrupts kidney waste removal functions.

In an Instagram video posted on October 26, the physician explains how the body processes vitamin C and highlights that excessive supplementation can increase the risk of kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Excess vitamin C can backfire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood highlights that while vitamin C is essential for immune function, megadoses cannot “supercharge” your immunity and raises the risk of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/is-milk-the-culprit-urologist-explains-if-lactose-overconsumption-can-cause-kidney-stones-101757400488624.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="kidney stones"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;. He explains how vitamin C is absorbed by the body - “Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) breaks down into oxalate, which increases urinary oxalate levels. When this combines with calcium in the urine, calcium oxalate crystals can form - the most common type of kidney stone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk is higher in men, people with a history of kidney stones and those with impaired kidney function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What research suggests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood points out that &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463139/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="studies"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; indicate an increased risk of kidney stones only with excessive use of artificial vitamin C supplements, whereas natural, food-based sources pose no such risk. He states, “In a cohort of over 1,97,000 adults followed for more than a decade, men who took more than or equal to 700 to 800 mg of supplemental vitamin C per day had a higher kidney stone risk, with the strongest signal above 1,000 mg per day. Food-based vitamin C showed no such risk. Metabolic studies found one to two grams of vitamin C per day raised urinary oxalate by 20 to 60 percent, promoting stone formation even in healthy individuals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Immune support versus overuse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physician states, “The NIH notes that vitamin C supports normal immune function, but evidence for illness prevention is limited. High-dose supplements can also raise urinary uric acid and oxalate without proven added benefit.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommends aiming for 75 to 90 mg of vitamin C per day from foods like citrus fruits, berries, pepper, and cruciferous vegetables - these support immunity without increasing the risk of stones. He also cautions against using long-term doses of 1,000 mg or more per day, unless specifically instructed by your doctor. As for high risk individuals, he advises, “For those with a history of stones, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-warns-frequent-nighttime-urination-can-be-a-sign-of-prostatitis-or-kidney-disease-5-symptoms-to-watch-out-for-101760081150911.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="kidney disease"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, or high-dose use, consider a 24-hour urine check and emphasise hydration, normal calcium intake, and sodium moderation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

					&lt;p&gt;A researcher at the University of Haifa says he has found that people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes face a 50 percent higher risk of developing late-onset schizophrenia compared to people without diabetes. For women, the risk may be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Type 2 diabetes is already known to raise the risks of multiple health conditions, including heart disease and dementia,” said lead researcher Prof. Stephen Levine of Haifa’s School of Public Health, who recently spoke to The Times of Israel in a teleconference call. “Our findings show it also increases the risk of schizophrenia in middle and old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher said the findings could allow early identification of high-risk individuals and lead to new protocols that include psychiatric monitoring and support as an integral part of diabetic patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The study followed more than 99,000 Israelis aged 51 to 71, all members of Meuhedet Health Services and without a prior history of Type 2 diabetes or schizophrenia, from January 2005 to February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that those with Type 2 diabetes were 50% more likely to develop schizophrenia than those who did not have the blood sugar disorder. Among women, the figure rose to 64%, while men were 39% more likely, Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Type 2 diabetes patients more likely to develop schizophrenia, Israeli researchers find"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in collaboration with Prof. Arad Kodesh from Haifa’s Department of Community Mental Health and Meuhedet Health Services and Prof. Abraham Reichenberg from the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was published last month in the peer-reviewed Oxford University Press journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/advance-article/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbaf159/8253574"&gt;Schizophrenia Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The research might help prevent considerable suffering for patients and their families,” Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;h3&gt;Why diabetes might cause schizophrenia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine said there are several reasons why Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, and late-onset schizophrenia sometimes occur together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the association might be due to the same genes in both conditions. One diabetes-related gene, TCF7L2, which helps control insulin release and blood-sugar regulation, has also been linked to higher schizophrenia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies find that people experiencing their first episode of psychosis often have unusual blood-sugar readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes often find it difficult to maintain healthy habits. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and poor sleep can worsen overall health, possibly making schizophrenia more likely. Some research suggests that the way the body reacts to stress could increase the risk for both Type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Mark Weiser, who has served as the chairman of the psychiatric division at Sheba Medical Center since 2006 and does research in schizophrenia, epidemiological studies and clinical trials, told The Times of Israel that the medications given to patients with schizophrenia are often associated with a risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, when a schizophrenia patient gets diabetes, we say it’s because of the medication,” Weiser said. “But these findings show something that’s exactly the opposite, which is very intriguing.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siblings of people with schizophrenia are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, and family histories of diabetes and schizophrenia tend to appear together, hinting at shared family risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In women, lower estrogen levels after midlife may also play a role in triggering schizophrenia at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine said that medical teams who follow people with diabetes could give a brief psychological screening test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Investigating an unusual comorbidity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine, who for the past 20 years has studied schizophrenia, including the risks of schizophrenia in Holocaust survivors, said that there is considerable scientific evidence showing that people with schizophrenia are at risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia can lead to changes in an individual’s metabolism, which could increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine said that he thought, “There’s no reason for the association not to be the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody had ever researched that before,” said Levine, who was born in Scotland and moved to Israel in 1988. “I wanted to turn the research on its head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes, which is often associated with obesity and a lack of exercise, is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Characterized by high blood sugar levels and associated with damage to blood vessels, the heart, and the nervous system, the disease could cause blindness, kidney dysfunction and lead to limb amputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have linked rising rates of Type 2 diabetes worldwide to sharp growth in numbers of overweight individuals, as well as declines in physical activity and increased life expectancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, diabetes rates have risen slightly from 6.6% of the population in 2012 to 7.4% in 2023, the last year for which Health Ministry data is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3038944" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2023/06/AP23146705997249.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3038944" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2023/06/AP23146705997249-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Two women stand on August 16, 2016, in New York. High body mass index, an indication that people could be overweight, was linked to more than half of deaths and disability from diabetes. (Mark Lennihan/AP)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, nearly 600 million people suffered from diabetes as of 2024, a number expected to surpass 850 million by 2050, with the highest prevalence expected in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the International Diabetes Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most worrying thing is that diabetes is clearly on an increase worldwide,” Levine said. “There are major contributing factors to the disease which are preventable, many of which are lifestyle factors, including diet and physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population around the world, including in Israel. Onset usually starts when people are in their early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People with the disorder have hallucinations, they have delusions, confusion, and cognitive disorder,” Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;He explained that after the disorder’s onset, it “[persists across] one’s lifespan, incurring functional impairments, occupational impairments, as well as social and family stigma and challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rare for people to develop schizophrenia in middle age, Levine said. There were approximately 1.2 cases of adult onset schizophrenia per 100,000 people per year among those without diabetes during the time of his study. However, among people with Type 2 diabetes, there were about 2.6 cases of adult onset schizophrenia per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Since] we know that people with diabetes suffer from more depression,” Levine said, “there’s no harm in doctors adding a couple of questions to probe patients’ psychotic experiences to be aware of a potential issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Identifying psychosis early in adults with diabetes could reduce patient suffering,” he said. “At the same time, it could help relieve some of the burden of caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's a parasite living in the brains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-us-still-doesnt-test-for-this-common-harmful-parasite-during-pregnancy"&gt;40 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;, and most of these human hosts are completely unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors don't usually treat this bug unless it begins wreaking havoc on the bodies of patients with weakened immune systems, but a new discovery may make short work of the invader without the typical risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitologist Rajshekhar Gaji runs a lab at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, investigating what makes the parasite, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cat-parasite-can-seriously-disrupt-brain-function-study-suggests"&gt;Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The parasite that's sitting in the brain gets reactivated, starts multiplying, and then it's fatal," Gaji &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/vetmed-research-parasite.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "Because of that, the parasite is a dreaded pathogen." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;is closely associated with cats, which are the only known hosts within which the parasite can reproduce sexually. But once its offspring are shed in the cat's poop, there are very few warm-blooded species &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; won't make a home in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, an infection with &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;will fall &lt;span&gt;completely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;under the radar. For those with cancer, HIV, or who are on immunosuppressants, the parasite presents significant risks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a healthy immune system to keep &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;at bay, these patients can quickly develop a disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"&gt;toxoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;, which can bring flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, and brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite can also be transmitted to the placenta of a developing fetus during pregnancy. This form of the disease, congenital toxoplasmosis, can cause developmental problems, and even miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments for acute toxoplasmosis involve medications that target mechanisms in the parasite that are biologically similar to processes in our own bodies. This often puts patients at risk of severe side effects, restricting treatments to situations where infections are considered to be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaji and his team might have found a lead, though: in a new study, they&lt;span&gt; have shown that switching off just a single protein inside the microscopic parasite can kill it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein, &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, appears to be essential to the parasite's ability to invade a host, form plaques, and self-replicate. To prove this, the team genetically modified some parasites so that their TgAP2X-7 proteins function normally unless &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin"&gt;auxin&lt;/a&gt; (a plant hormone that regulates growth) is added, in which case the proteins would quickly degrade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Auxin, they established prior, had no impact on &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;growth or plaque formation on its own, so any effect it had on the genetically modified parasites could be attributed to the fact that the TgAP2X-7 proteins had been destroyed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprived of &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, the parasites couldn't form plaques, and their ability to invade hosts (which, in this lab study, were human foreskin cells) was severely impaired. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usually, they have a near-100 percent success rate invading these kinds of cells, but without that key protein, success dropped to below 50 percent. They also struggled to replicate.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Found The Protein Switch That Drives Widespread Brain Parasite" class="wp-image-178106 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1200x478.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-768x306.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1536x612.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-600x239.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004.jpg 1877w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Strains that had their TgAP2X-7 destroyed (B) were unable to propagate at the same rate as those with the protein intact (A).

Though it is said to strike at any age or at any time of the year, winters pose a special set of problems to individuals with high Blood pressure. Cold weather not only bring chills, but it also impacts the body in many ways. During winters, blood vessels tighten, raising blood pressure levels and adding additional stress on heart. Comprehending high blood pressure during winters is important to avoid complications like heart attacks, strokes, and kidney issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reasons why winters influence blood pressure: Risk factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per PubMed Central, in a study under the heading, '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3883610/#sec2" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Winter Hypertension: Potential mechanisms'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, It includes various factors that cause winter hypertension:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Temperature and BP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Cold temperature is correlated with increased blood pressure, whereas warm temperature lowers BP.

Dizziness leads to cold-induced alterations in blood vessels resulting in blood pressure swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cold hands and feet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During winters, reduced blood supply to the vessels may cause numb tingling feeling in extremities. Although prevalent among most individuals, it can indicate poorly regulated blood pressure, that is susceptible to hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure places greater workload on the heart, becoming more difficult to circulate the blood effectively. Cold air, particularly in winter, can make the strain worse, resulting in shortness of breath or a sensation of chest tightness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected change in temperature or season can aggravate the fatigue in individuals who have high Bp. Being tired now and then is a different issue, but getting weak, could be a sign that the heart is working too hard, due to cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chest pain or palpitations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unpredicted chest pain, tightness, or abnormal heart rhythms may be warning signs of hypertension complications.
