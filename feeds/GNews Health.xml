                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 26, 8:55 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is speaking out on the recent outbreaks in multiple Washoe County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been digging all day trying to get answers and learned the number of schools impacted increased on Wednesday afternoon before the Washoe County School District reported a slight decrease on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 6:42 p.m. on Wednesday four Washoe County schools are on outbreak status, down from six reported Wednesday afternoon and five reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two are dealing with respiratory illness outbreaks, one with gastrointestinal, and one is dealing with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 20 classrooms are now in outbreak status. 15 of them for respiratory and five for gastrointestinal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been pressing the school district all day, but they tell us they will not release the names of the schools affected at this time. Northern Nevada Public Health tells us that's due to HIPAA policies. However, they say the families of the schools impacted have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liliana Wilbert, an epidemiologist for NNPH, says, "In order to protect the confidentiality of the schools and the families that are impacted we do not share that type of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of those affiliated with affected schools have reached out to 2 News Nevada to share that schools attended by their children have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email obtained by 2 News Nevada that was sent to parents at Van Gorder Elementary School said that the school has seen an increase in the number of students and staff members who have been absent or sent home due to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another email obtained by 2 News Nevada confirms that a STEM Night planned for Van Gorder Elementary on Tuesday was canceled and will be rescheduled due to the school being placed on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents at Rollan Melton Elementary reached out to 2 News Nevada about multiple instances of children suffering gastrointestinal issues, with more than a dozen said to have been sent home. While parents have reported illness at Rollan Melton, we have not been able to obtain any notice from the district formally naming it as a school on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District wants to make it clear that if families have not heard from them about their schools, then that means those schools are not impacted by an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says right now the respiratory illnesses they are seeing are RSV, influenza, and general influenza-like illnesses that are more commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is practicing its clean-up procedures for these illnesses. That includes removing all nearby individuals, cleaning and sanitizing contaminated areas, and keeping sick students and staff away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says if your child is starting to show any symptoms of illnesses they should stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, region-wide and not limited to schools, NNPH is reporting there are 187 RSV cases reported, 36 hospitalizations due to flu, and 19 deaths due to flu, two of those deaths being under the age of 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 26, 3:15 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting an increase in the number of schools and classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon the district announced that there are now six schools and 20 individual classrooms on outbreak status, up from five and 19 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six schools, one is on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, two are for gastrointestinal only, and three are for respiratory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 20 classrooms, 15 are on outbreak status for respiratory illness and five are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGINAL ARTICLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several schools and classrooms within the Washoe County School District are on outbreak status as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five entire schools and 19 classrooms are currently on outbreak status according to a WCSD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the schools is on outbreak status for both respiratory and gastrointestinal illness while there are two on outbreak status for respiratory illness and two for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 19 classrooms listed on outbreak status, 15 are for respiratory illness and four are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the specific schools and classrooms on outbreak status were not provided by the School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said in a statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 4 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 4 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death comes amid falling immunisation rates in the US and controversy over the appointment of vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/13/us-senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-as-health-and-human-services-leader?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;as the country’s top health official.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 130 measles cases have been reported in Texas and the neighbouring state of New Mexico this year, almost all of them in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials have said most of the cases have been concentrated in a community of followers of the Mennonite Christian sect, pockets of which are known for being wary of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the outbreak at US President Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/26/key-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-first-cabinet-meeting-with-elon-musk"&gt;first cabinet meeting on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy, who has promoted scientifically discredited research linking vaccines to autism, downplayed the outbreak as “not unusual”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country,” Kennedy told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, there were 16. So, it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases in the US hit a nearly two-decade peak of 1,274 in 2019, before plummeting during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities reported 285 cases in 2024, up from 59 in 2023 and 121 the year before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization declared measles eliminated from the US in 2000 – meaning no outbreaks had persisted for a year or more – but that status has come under threat in recent years amid growing anti-vaccine sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US last reported a measles-related death in 2015, after 12 years without a fatality linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be extremely dangerous for people who are not vaccinated, including young infants who are not usually eligible for immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated people in the US who get measles are hospitalised, and as many as one out of every 20 children with measles get pneumonia, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

Members of the March 13 meeting were set to vote on which flu strains would offer the most protection in next season's flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Influenza vaccines aren't perfect and to get the best influence vaccine each year requires predicting the strain as best we can," said Dr. Andrew Pavia, professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of Utah and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. "There's a lot of complex data that needs to be reviewed and having a number of experts do it gives us the best chance of making the best prediction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The meeting typically takes into consideration recommendations from WHO. It also receives input and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense and vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The timing of this meeting aligns with the six-month lead time typically required for vaccine manufacturing to ensure vaccines are ready for distribution in the fall -- before peak flu season hits in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I can't think of any rational reason to do this other than to throw a hand grenade into vaccine production," Pavia said. "The impact is going to be felt in terms of our ability to reduce flu hospitalizations and flu deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Earlier in the week, officials and specialists at the CDC virtually joined the annual WHO meeting to discuss the upcoming flu vaccine strain for next year, despite being previously ordered to halt all communication with the global health organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Typically, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets after the WHO meeting to finalize recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It remains unclear what impact the meeting cancellation may have on next season's flu vaccine.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky health officials have confirmed a measles case in the state on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials with the Kentucky Department of Public Health (KDPH) and the Franklin County Health Department said an adult "had recently traveled internationally to an area with ongoing measles transmission."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said the Kentuckian went to a gym while infectious, and they are working to contact anyone who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who went to the Planet Fitness on Allen Way in Frankfort on Monday, Feb. 17 from 9 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. may have been exposed health officials said. Anyone exposed and unvaccinated should quarantine for 21 days and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world,” KDPH Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack said. “Fortunately, measles can be prevented with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is safe and effective. Vaccines are an essential tool to keep children and adults safe and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles can cause serious health issues, especially in young children health officials said. It spreads through the air and can survive up to two hours after the infected person leaves an area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, and begins eight to 12 days after exposure health officials said. The rash typically appears three to five days after the initial symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials, the last confirmed case of measles in Kentucky was 2023.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Heat takes it out of you. After a long, hot day, we feel tired and grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sustained periods of heat do more than that – they age us faster. Cumulative heat stress changes our  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="153502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt; – how our cells turn on or off gene switches in response to environmental pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from the United States explores the pressing question of how extreme heat affects humans. The findings are concerning. The more days of intense heat a participant endured, the faster they aged. Longer periods of extreme heat accelerated ageing in older people by more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the climate heats up, humans will be exposed to more and more heat – and our bodies will respond to these stresses by ageing faster. These findings are especially pertinent to Australia, where heatwaves &lt;a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/"&gt;are expected&lt;/a&gt; to become more frequent and intense in a warmer world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How, exactly, does heat age us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ageing is natural. But the rate of ageing varies from human to human. As we go through life, our bodies are affected by stresses and shocks. For instance, if we don't get enough sleep over a long period, we will &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458022000264"&gt;age faster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While heat can directly sicken or kill us, it also has a long tail. Sustained heat &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0913352107"&gt;stresses our bodies&lt;/a&gt; and make them less efficient at doing the many jobs needed to stay alive. This is what we mean when we say it accelerates biological ageing. This deterioration is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21302421/"&gt;likely to precede&lt;/a&gt; the later development of diseases and disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that look like on a genetic level? You might think your genes don't change over your life, and this is mostly true (apart from random mutations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does change is how your genes are expressed. That is, while your DNA stays the same, your cells can switch some of its thousands of genes off or on in response to stresses. At any one time, only a fraction of the genes in any cell are turned on – meaning they are busy making proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics-and-health/epigenetics/index.html"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;. The most common and best understood pathway here is called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; (DNAm). Methylation here refers to a chemical our cells can use to block a DNA sequence from activating and producing proteins with various functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYHBbEKap0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular changes in DNAm can lead to proteins being produced more or less, which in turn can flow on to affect physiological functions and our health status. This can be both bad or good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat stress can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35413138/"&gt;alter the pattern&lt;/a&gt; of which genes are turned off or on, which in turn can affect our rate of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe heat stress can be remembered in cells, leading them to change their DNAm patterns over time. In laboratory testing, the effect is pronounced in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978736/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, chickens, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4769883/"&gt;guinea pigs&lt;/a&gt; and mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, much research on how heat affects epigenetics has focused on animals and plants. Here, the evidence is clear – even a single episode of extreme heat has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33037634/"&gt;been shown&lt;/a&gt; to have a long-lasting effect on mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only a couple of studies have been done involving humans, and they have been limited. This is the gap this new research is intended to help fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153506" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153506" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642.jpg" alt="Extreme Heat Accelerates Aging by Over Two Years, New Research Finds" class="size-full wp-image-153506" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ThermometerInSunlightHeat642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153506" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sustained heat changes how our cells express genes – accelerating ageing. (BeritK/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by researchers at the University of Southern California involved almost 3,700 people, with an average age of 68 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat affects older people more than younger people. Our ability to control our body temperature drops as we age, and we are less resilient to outside stresses and shocks. We also know periods of extreme heat &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00635-w"&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; a wave of illness and death, especially among older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study set out to better understand what happens to human bodies at a biological level when they're exposed to intense heat over the short, medium and longer term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers took blood samples and measured  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="153502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; at thousands of sites across the genome, which were used to calculate three clocks measuring biological age, named PcPhenoAge, PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153508" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642.jpg" alt="Extreme Heat Accelerates Aging by Over Two Years, New Research Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-153508" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SeniorWomanInSunlightHeat642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153508" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ageing is natural – but the speed at which we age can change. (Studio Brazil/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they looked at the levels of heat each participant would have been exposed in their geographic areas over the preceding six years, which was 2010–16. They used the US heat index to assess heat, from caution (days up to 32°C), extreme caution (32–39°C) and danger (39–51°C). They used regression modelling to see how much faster people were ageing over the normal rate of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of heat was clear in the three biological clocks. Longer term exposure to intense heat increased biological age by 2.48 years over the six year period of the study according to PCPhenoAge, 1.09 years according to PCGrimAge and 0.05 years according to DunedinPACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the period of the study, the effect was up to 2.48 years faster than normal ageing, where one calendar year equals one biological year of ageing. That is, rather than their bodies ageing the equivalent of six years over a six year period, heat could have aged their bodies up to 8.48 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the biological clocks differ quite substantially and we don't yet know why. The authors suggest the PCPhenoAge clock may capture a broader spectrum of biological ageing, covering both short term and longer term heat stress, while the other two may be more sensitive to long term heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way these researchers have conducted their study gives us confidence in their findings – the study sample was large and representative, and the use of the heat index rather than air temperature is an improvement over previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the findings don't account for whether the participants had airconditioning in their homes or spent much time outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We need to know more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, there has been little research done to date on what heat does to human epigenetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, we conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749119355812"&gt;systemic review&lt;/a&gt; of the science of how environment affects human epigenetics. We found only seven studies, with most focused on the effect of cold rather than heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have this new research which sheds light on the extent to which heat ages us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we face a warmer future, our epigenetics will change in response. There is still a lot of work to do to see how we can adapt to these changes – or if we even can, in some parts of the world.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250784/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year again, when everyone’s fighting a cold and blowing their nose. Maybe you’ve found yourself having sinus struggles, or you’ve noticed your boogers don’t look “normal.” Whatever the case may be, mucus abounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mucus is a natural product to keep our airways moist in regular times, and to work with our immune system to fight off an irritant, infection, or other inflammation in others,” said Dr. Stephen Vogel, a family medicine physician with PlushCare. “Normal mucus appears clear to white for most people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your boogers aren’t clear, then it’s possible something else might be going on, whether it’s allergies or something more serious. We spoke with doctors about what your boogers could be saying about your health, from the color to the consistency, and when you’ll want to see a doctor about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus usually means that your body is dealing with an infection. It’s often a direct result of the white blood cells fighting off a bacteria or virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yellow mucus also tends to become thicker and/or more concentrated when your body’s immune system is activated,” said &lt;a href="https://doctorconnor.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7835079" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Brynna Connor&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician and health care ambassador at NorthWestPharmacy.com. “The potential causes of yellow mucus include the common cold or a bacterial infection such as sinusitis (a sinus infection) or bronchitis (a respiratory infection).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Connor, green mucus can suggest you are suffering from a more serious bacterial infection. “The green color comes from enzymes that are released by the white blood cells as they fight infection and typically indicates a prolonged and/or more intense immune response,” Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some possible causes of green mucus include a bacterial sinus infection, bacterial bronchitis, or pneumonia. However, green mucus can also simply consist of boogers that have been in your sinuses for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING COUNTY, Wash. — At least two domestic, indoor cats were infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in King and Snohomish counties after eating potentially contaminated food linked to other &lt;a href="/article/news/health/cat-bird-flu-euthanized-multnomah-county-raw-pet-food-washington/283-48083bb3-64ac-4646-8f4d-7b064670d00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;illnesses in Oregon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cats was euthanized due to the severity of the illness. The other is being treated by a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Washington State Department of Agriculture, pet owners reported feeding the cats Wild Coast Raw food, which was &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=42075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;identified &lt;/a&gt;as a possible source of bird flu infection earlier in February. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presumptive positive results for both cats were reported by the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory on Monday, Feb. 24. The results were confirmed by a national lab Feb. 25.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pet food was previously linked to illnesses in cats in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of HPAI or H5N1, also known as bird flu, include lethargy, low appetite, fever, hypothermia, progression of illness to pneumonia, progression of illness to neurologic abnormalities and upper respiratory infection. The department of agriculture asks anyone whose pet has consumed Wild Coast Raw and has any of these symptoms to contact their veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no documented human cases of HPAI following exposure to an infected cat or contaminated raw food product, according to the department of agriculture. The strain currently circulating is considered low risk to humans, but that risk increases for those who handle contaminated raw food or care for infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts suggest people do the following to prevent contact with H5N1 or HPAI: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid a raw food diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep cats indoors and not allow them to ingest wild birds - which could be infected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit pets contact with bird feces and droppings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 virus has been ravaging bird populations throughout the U.S., including backyard and commercial farms. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Doctors in the US have treated a fetus with a rapidly progressive congenital disease from inside the womb for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving medicine to a child with severe neuromuscular complications &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they are born, a new case study details how a prospective mother agreed to take the medicine for her developing fetus while she was still pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prenatal test had shown that her fetus held two genetic mutations indicating type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which usually results in severe muscle weakness and breathing difficulties &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/spinal-muscular-atrophy"&gt;within six months of birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, most children with type 1 SMA die &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma"&gt;by their second birthday&lt;/a&gt;, usually from respiratory failure. However, the child in this study has so far made it to the age of two and a half years with no sign of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents of the treated child had previously experienced the loss of their baby to spinal muscular atrophy, and when testing showed their most recent fetus also had the progressive neuromuscular disease, they wanted to know if they could start treatments earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this single case, the FDA approved the early administration of the oral drug risdiplam, brand name Evrysdi, owned by the pharmaceutical company F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, randomized controlled &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-10-14"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown risdiplam to be both safe and effective at treating spinal muscular atrophy in newborns, and the younger the kids are when they start receiving the medicine, the better the outcomes overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the pregnant mother took a dose of risdiplam each day for six weeks before giving birth. Testing found that the medicine trickled right through her umbilical cord blood and the amniotic fluid bathing her fetus. After birth, it was the infant that was given the daily oral drug, not the mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric neurologist Michelle Farrar, who is working on a minimally invasive&lt;a href="https://kr.schn.health.nsw.gov.au/articles/2022/06/life-changing-clinical-trial-will-save-hundreds"&gt; gene therapy treatment&lt;/a&gt; for SMA in Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00534-0"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Smriti Mallapaty at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that the baby girl with SMA "has been effectively treated, with no manifestations of the condition" even 30 months after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153127" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-642x689.png" alt="Risdiplam" class="wp-image-153127 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-642x689.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-387x415.png 387w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-768x825.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492-600x644.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Risdiplam-e1740614806492.png 773w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153127" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Risdiplam is sold under the brand name Evrysdi. (&lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/solutions/pharma/productid-423934d3-782a-4102-884a-1db9fafc8ae8"&gt;Roche&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, risdiplam was first &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2020-08-10b"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for kids with spinal muscular atrophy, but only over the age of two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00367-7"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; funded by Roche, however, found the &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-10-14"&gt;majority of children&lt;/a&gt; with spinal muscular atrophy treated with risdiplam &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; six weeks of age could swallow, feed, sit, stand, and walk on their own after two years of treatment. None required permanent ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risdiplam works to prevent the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and body by increasing the concentration of a crucial protein, called survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Active SMN proteins are lacking in those with genetic mutations that cause spinal muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In children with SMA, motor neuron degeneration starts before the onset of symptoms, so time is of the essence if we hope to preserve muscle function," &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-10-14"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; pediatric neurologist Laurent Servais in a press release for a Roche  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's heartening to see that through early intervention with Evrysdi these children have achieved important milestones like sitting, standing, and walking that would typically be unattainable without treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the recent case study in the US will inspire and embolden doctors and parents to trial risdiplam at earlier stages of development remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Results in this single case cannot be generalized but may support the consideration of prenatal risdiplam treatment for SMA identified in utero," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2300802"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2300802"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So far, there have been 86 deaths in children and 19,000 deaths in adults this season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA typically convenes the meeting every spring to get recommendations on which strains should be included in the upcoming flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The meetings are important because the flu virus changes year to year, and the vaccine must be updated to provide the best protection. Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the 2024-2025 flu season, drugmakers supplied the U.S. with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/vaccine-supply/vaxadmin.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for Americans who want to get a flu vaccine next season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA's strain selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-ordered-stop-working-immediately-upending-expectations-extended-wi-rcna189508" target="_blank"&gt;stop communicating with the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/24/us-who-flu-vaccine-meeting-london/" target="_blank"&gt;Stat News reported &lt;/a&gt;on Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" target="_blank"&gt;CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines, including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine, as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/" target="_blank"&gt;at-home nasal spray&lt;/a&gt; for influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F.

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/disease-outbreaks/outbreaks-and-other-emergencies-updates"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the disease was first detected on January 21, and over the past five weeks hundreds have been infected and more than 50 people have died in the northwest of the country. Health officials are yet to determine the cause of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Initial investigations suggest the outbreak began in the village of Boloko, where three children died within days of eating the carcass of a bat. The symptoms of the infected include fever, headache, diarrhea, nosebleeds, vomiting blood, and general bleeding—which match the symptoms caused by viruses such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/ebola/"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and Marburg. However, experts have ruled out these pathogens after testing more than a dozen samples from suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In early February, health authorities recorded a second cluster of cases and deaths in the village of Bomate, several hundred kilometers away, though there is currently no known link between the clusters. As of February 15, when the WHO last reported on the outbreak, a total of 431 suspected infections had been reported, including 53 deaths. In most cases, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death was only 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Samples from 18 cases have been sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in the DRC's capital, Kinshasa, testing negative for the most common pathogens linked to hemorrhagic fever symptoms, although some tested positive for malaria. “The exact cause remains unknown, with Ebola and Marburg already ruled out, raising concerns about a severe infectious or toxic agent,” the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380529/OEW7-1016022025.pdf"&gt;WHO wrote&lt;/a&gt; in its most recent bulletin on the outbreak, stressing the urgent need to accelerate laboratory investigations, improve the management and isolation of those infected, and increase surveillance and risk communication. “The remote location and weak health care infrastructure increase the risk of further spread, requiring immediate high-level intervention to contain the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Disease outbreaks caused by pathogens in animals transferring to humans—a process known as zoonotic spillover—are becoming more common in Africa. Changing land use and climate change are two major drivers, as they can both increase contact between humans and pathogen-harboring wildlife. According to estimates &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/africa-63-jump-diseases-spread-animals-people-seen-last-decade"&gt;from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;, outbreaks of diseases transmitted from animals to people increased by 63 percent in Africa between 2012 and 2022. The continent has seen multiple outbreaks of mpox in recent years, as well as clusters of Ebola and Marburg cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Late last year, another mysterious illness killed more than 70 people in the southwest of the DRC, many of them children. Symptoms in that outbreak were flu-like, and most patient samples tested came back positive for malaria. The outbreak was later attributed to respiratory infections aggravated by malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.it/article/nuova-malattia-congo-mortale-non-identificata-pipistrelli/"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;Italia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Italian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:20:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPbmx6S1dWLW01dmFRSDBqVzFIVnotSjRWRTRrMk84Z29EYXNVeVJiWUpwT2lCXzVqNk9OYVd0M3ZCdG15MXdZc1VzWmNsRmJTSmlLQXZqaF9FVm8xMFAtTm13MXppcjN1V3loUGVabDNqU001WUFpU1lIZVVJbWpYSzlIa194U2JCaUwyM2g5WEh1ZFRRTU43NFFpOA</guid></item><item><title>CDC investigating hospitalizations of five people who recently received chikungunya vaccine - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNa3lYaW1FWGNySDVCWEZsTmhwcDhwUUJpcVk4RDFndmt5dzRKRldQdmJSQnE0NlR4clFtclkxSmo4bDhYbnctRWZNNWdPTmNGaDR3UGZJMDZUeFFZOXByNmUwbWJfdkdYRnBLdUE5eThmV0NTamsyMHRINDk4bndxVHNzWnFTRWZtcFpsM1ZrUUUtdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently investigating five hospitalizations that occurred in people who had recently received a vaccine that prevents disease caused by the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/hcp/vaccine/index.html#cdc_generic_section_3-vaccine-immunogenicity-and-side-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:notice posted Tuesday on a vaccine information page for health-care providers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;notice posted Tuesday on a vaccine information page for health-care providers&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said that the people, all 65 and older, were hospitalized for cardiac or neurologic events following vaccination with IXCHIQ, the only chikungunya vaccine currently licensed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CNN has reached out to the CDC for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya virus is typically spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito.

    &lt;/p&gt;

            Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,is%20recommended%20for%20some%20travelers." target="_blank"&gt;chikungunya infections&lt;/a&gt; include fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or rash, according to the CDC, and the best way to prevent chikungunya is to avoid mosquito bites. There are currently no medications to treat chikungunya, but infected people may feel better with rest, fluids and over-the-counter medications for pain and fever.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In Tuesday’s notice, the CDC said that common adverse reactions following vaccination that occurred in more than 10% of vaccinated people in clinical trials included tenderness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, fever and nausea. In some people, “severe or prolonged chikungunya-like adverse reactions” occurred.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7md8pl2000t3b6mz1fmyam4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chikungunya-like reactions included “fever, joint pain, headache, rash, and can also include cardiac and neurologic conditions which were serious in two cases,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in the clinical studies, said in an email Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000f3b6m42o2kalq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s notice encouraged health-care providers “to report all adverse events that might be caused by vaccination to the CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS),” by &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;submitting a report online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/uploadFile/index.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;using a PDF form&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mdc9bv000x3b6m5olzixx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The robust vaccine safety surveillance system often identifies extremely rare adverse effects of vaccines after approval,” said Barouch, an infectious disease expert not involved in the CDC investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mcnh1c000g3b6mgozo60v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the vaccine was approved in 2023, the FDA noted that its safety was evaluated in two clinical studies conducted in North America in which about 3,500 adults received a dose of the vaccine, with one study including about 1,000 participants who received a placebo. Severe chikungunya-like adverse reactions occurred in 1.6% of IXCHIQ recipients and none of the placebo recipients, according to the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 26, 8:55 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is speaking out on the recent outbreaks in multiple Washoe County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been digging all day trying to get answers and learned the number of schools impacted increased on Wednesday afternoon before the Washoe County School District reported a slight decrease on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 6:42 p.m. on Wednesday four Washoe County schools are on outbreak status, down from six reported Wednesday afternoon and five reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two are dealing with respiratory illness outbreaks, one with gastrointestinal, and one is dealing with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 20 classrooms are now in outbreak status. 15 of them for respiratory and five for gastrointestinal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been pressing the school district all day, but they tell us they will not release the names of the schools affected at this time. Northern Nevada Public Health tells us that's due to HIPPA policies. However, they say the families of the schools impacted have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liliana Wilbert, an epidemiologist for NNPH, says, "In order to protect the confidentiality of the schools and the families that are impacted we do not share that type of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of those affiliated with affected schools have reached out to 2 News Nevada to share that schools attended by their children have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email obtained by 2 News Nevada that was sent to parents at Van Gorder Elementary School said that the school has seen an increase in the number of students and staff members who have been absent or sent home due to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another email obtained by 2 News Nevada confirms that a STEM Night planned for Van Gorder Elementary on Tuesday was canceled and will be rescheduled due to the school being placed on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents at Rollan Melton Elementary reached out to 2 News Nevada about multiple instances of children suffering gastrointestinal issues, with more than a dozen said to have been sent home. While parents have reported illness at Rollan Melton, we have not been able to obtain any notice from the district formally naming it as a school on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District wants to make it clear that if families have not heard from them about their schools, then that means those schools are not impacted by an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says right now the respiratory illnesses they are seeing are RSV, influenza, and general influenza-like illnesses that are more commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is practicing its clean-up procedures for these illnesses. That includes removing all nearby individuals, cleaning and sanitizing contaminated areas, and keeping sick students and staff away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says if your child is starting to show any symptoms of illnesses they should stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, region-wide and not limited to schools, NNPH is reporting there are 187 RSV cases reported, 36 hospitalizations due to flu, and 19 deaths due to flu, two of those deaths being under the age of 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 26, 3:15 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting an increase in the number of schools and classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon the district announced that there are now six schools and 20 individual classrooms on outbreak status, up from five and 19 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six schools, one is on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, two are for gastrointestinal only, and three are for respiratory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 20 classrooms, 15 are on outbreak status for respiratory illness and five are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGINAL ARTICLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several schools and classrooms within the Washoe County School District are on outbreak status as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five entire schools and 19 classrooms are currently on outbreak status according to a WCSD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the schools is on outbreak status for both respiratory and gastrointestinal illness while there are two on outbreak status for respiratory illness and two for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 19 classrooms listed on outbreak status, 15 are for respiratory illness and four are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the specific schools and classrooms on outbreak status were not provided by the School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Unidentified illnesses in northwestern Congo have killed more than 50 people over the past five weeks, nearly half of them within hours after they felt sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks in two distant villages in Congo’s Equateur province began on Jan. 21 and include 419 cases and 53 deaths. Health officials still do not know the cause, or whether the cases in the two villages, which are separated by more than 120 miles (190 kilometers), are related. It’s also unclear how the diseases are spreading, including whether they are spreading between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mystery-illness-has-killed-more-than-50-people-in-congo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Mystery illness has killed more than 50 people in Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first victims in one of the villages were children who ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said this week. More infections were found in the other village, where at least some of the patients have malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outbreaks in two remote villages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illnesses have been clustered in two remote villages in different health zones of Equateur province, which is 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. More than two weeks later a second and larger outbreak was recorded in the village of Bomate, where more than 400 people have been sickened. According to WHO’s Africa office, no links have been established between the cases in the two villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, and one of the government experts deployed to respond to the outbreak, says the situations in the two villages are somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first one with a lot of deaths, that we continue to investigate because it’s an unusual situation, (and) in the second episode that we’re dealing with, we see a lot of the cases of malaria,” said Dr. Ngalebato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO Africa office said the quick progression from sickness to death in Boloko is a key concern, along with the high number of deaths in Bomate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo’s Ministry of Health said about 80 percent of the patients share similar symptoms including fever, chills, body aches and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these symptoms can be caused by many common infections, health officials initially feared the symptoms and the quick deaths of some of the victims could also be a sign of a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola, which was also linked to an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Ebola and similar diseases including Marburg have been ruled out after more than a dozen samples were collected and tested in the capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nurse-dies-from-ebola-in-uganda-as-country-declares-first-virus-outbreak-since-2022-health-ministry-says"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nurse dies from Ebola in Uganda as country declares first virus outbreak since 2022, health ministry says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said it is investigating a number of possible causes, including malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is being done in response?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo’s government says experts have been sent to the villages since Feb. 14, mainly to help investigate the cases and slow the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ngalebato said patients have been responding to treatments that target the different symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote location of the villages has hindered access to patients while the weak health care infrastructure has made it difficult to carry out surveillance and manage patients. Such challenges are common in disease outbreaks in Congo. In December, an unknown illness killed dozens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest outbreaks, several victims died even before experts could even reach them, Ngalebato said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be an urgent action “to accelerate laboratory investigations, improve case management and isolation capacities, and strengthen surveillance and risk communication,” the WHO Africa office has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has been the largest bilateral donor to Congo’s health sector and has supported the training of hundreds of field epidemiologists to help detect and control diseases across the vast country. The outbreaks were detected as the Trump administration put a freeze on foreign aid during a 90-day review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a link to Congo’s forests?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where people regularly eat wild animals. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say this might be what is happening in Congo, which is home to about 60% of the forests in the Congo Basin, home to the largest expanse of tropical forest on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these viruses are viruses that have reservoirs in the forest. And so, as long as we have these forests, we will always have a few epidemics with viruses which will mutate,” said Gabriel Nsakala, a professor of public health at Congo’s National Pedagogical University, who previously worked at the Congolese health ministry on Ebola and coronavirus response programs.&lt;/p&gt;

A spokesman for the federal agency later clarified that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified only one death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The federal government is providing vaccines as well as technical and laboratory support in West Texas, but the state health department is leading the response, said Andrew Nixon, spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said through a spokesman that his office is in regular communication with the state health department and epidemiologists, and that vaccination teams are in the “affected area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“The state will deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,” said spokesman Andrew Mahaleris, calling the child’s death a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-oembed-type="raw-html" id="isolated-embed-2JUUOGCJINGYDDXJH5MTDI6MRI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The CDC has said it will provide only weekly updates on &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/texas-has-an-ongoing-measles-outbreak-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus/" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;the measles outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and has not yet updated its public webpage to reflect the child’s death. Texas health department data shows that a majority of the reported measles cases are in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The virus has largely spread among rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community, health department spokesperson Lara Anton said. Gaines County, which has reported 80 cases so far, has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — which is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases — is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old for the first shot, with the second coming between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-oembed-type="raw-html" id="isolated-embed-BXWXXSRIGZBRXGT4RXGHACWL2Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/18/kennedy-panel-will-examine-childhood-vaccine-schedule-after-promising-not-to-change-it/" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kennedy vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases, despite promises not to change it during his confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;By DEVI SHASTRI and AMANDA SEITZ of The Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Kennedy Jr. was slammed after he downplayed the death of a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-5654c6d0-f48c-11ef-b357-3f8ece99cf70" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; child from measles, saying 'it's not unusual' and that there are outbreaks of the highly-contagious disease 'every year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are watching it,' the Health and Human Services Secretary told reporters at President &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/donald_trump/index.html" id="mol-31fef2e0-f48e-11ef-b357-3f8ece99cf70"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. 'There are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not unusual,' he added. 'We have measles outbreaks every year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. There was a rise in cases, however, in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senator Ron Wyden, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/democrats/index.html" id="mol-32412c00-f48e-11ef-b357-3f8ece99cf70"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-324809d0-f48e-11ef-b357-3f8ece99cf70"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; who tried to block RFK Jr.'s confirmation, slammed the health secretary's response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nothing about kids dying from measles is normal. Anti-vaxxers like RFK Jr. and the Republicans who enable them are responsible for every single one of these deaths,' Wyden wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health and  Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (second from left) at President Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congressman Herb Conaway, a Democrat from New Jersey who's a medical doctor, also had strong words for Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A child just died of measles - the first on mainland U.S. in a decade. I'm not surprised that RFK Jr. doesn't find this unusual. His anti-vaccine advocacy led to measles deaths in American Samoa,' he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor who was a key vote in getting Kennedy confirmed, expressed his concern about the cases but made no mention of Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Absolutely devastating news. Encouraging parents to make sure their child is up-to-date on their vaccines. The measles vaccine is safe and effective,' he wrote on X. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles is very serious and contagious, and it's important to make sure you and your child are up to date on vaccines. This is especially important for pregnant women,' he noted in an earlier post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kennedy, who is a fervent anti-vaxxer, made no mention of the measles vaccine, which is proven effective against the disease. He also made no mention of a federal response. State officials in Texas have taken the lead on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The school-aged child, who was not vaccinated, had been hospitalized and died Tuesday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death is the first attributed to measles in the U.S. since 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is facing its largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years with 124 cases seen across nine counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also spread into &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-mexico/index.html" id="mol-9834a400-f2af-11ef-a419-b9d4964cd120" class=""&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, with nine cases confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14422449/Pediatrician-working-heart-Texas-measles-outbreak-warns-just-beginning-cases-surging-90.html"&gt; highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In extreme cases, measles can cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-cb5817c0-f3ab-11ef-88ae-edf31e4f2435"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and may lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Members of the medical community took to social media to criticize Kennedy's leadership on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Alastair McAlpine, a pediatrician, wrote on X: 'Astonishing lack of leadership. In the face of a measles epidemic affecting mostly unvaccinated people, the correct response is to encourage vaccination!' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr. Nathan Boonstra pointed out a hospital wouldn't quarantine a measles patient because the disease is highly contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the kind of antivax misinfo to expect from him. People can quarantine at home, hospitals do not want you there infecting the vulnerable if you don't have to be there,' he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A sign reading 'measles testing' is seen as an outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, has raised concerns over its spread to other parts of the state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kennedy, as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency responsible for the response to epidemics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also appeared to misspeak at the Cabinet meeting, saying two people had died of the disease.

It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, per the CDC, which notes: 'This was thanks to a highly effective vaccination program in the United States, as well as better measles control in the Americas region.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:28:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNM05HbS1tZE9Uci1hdU43SUJOMFFTNTRiZjNlOE1PeXJfMVdDS2lIdmhNemVqWWJodHpLc2NzQmx2TENVMGtBS2k4bG1yWko0UXNQRDFYd1l0d0hLcXZ1eU9vdEx1R0k0XzVic2t2UWZwRkNHZEtRSXhJQTVFWjJYNTNkb1B5S3J4T2RYUXZqX0ZOTk010gGaAUFVX3lxTFBZUXFxMHNjU0duR2VMTmE4UDhWMGlMekRLNzVKSzk4cmhuQ2tpcGZLaGh6NGlEWUFaRUZEZE1RajEtX2pvR0hJMURsTGhuRzVnQmNSVmdnZUlNVklTQklYVDdIRGQtaGZ0S3pjSEdMUE9mUVpNdHhyenFWWGtabjdsWm93VjZTNmp4bjQ5eGYwVWdHcTBpaERiVWc</guid></item><item><title>Your takeout containers could cause congestive heart failure — even without microwaving them - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPTnk5WE51dU9Jcy1fUlB3akgzWThKRlBDVWJNYnZMZkFqOElFY2dFX2xCbGpZZ0tUTFFlTjVXVUVWam9XcXR2ZWpCb2Nhb0lsZjNVd1JhVUJtNkFyTS1sUWNmWU5tc3NzUGt3bk8yN3ozSzJ5M0NDXzlGaS1ndzZObGJhS2pLdGhUNzlqZVRsNDRHY2RqbDVCTFFQT0tlQUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted experiments on rats, exposing them to water that had been boiled and placed in plastic takeout lids for different durations — one, five and 15 minutes — over a period of three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were alarming — regardless of how long the plastic had been in contact with hot liquid, the rats experienced significant disruptions in the gut biome, including inflammation, which increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/15/health/first-of-its-kind-drug-can-reduce-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered significant damage to the myocardial — or heart muscle — leading them to conclude that “high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/23/health/doctor-reveals-3-symptoms-that-may-indicate-a-weak-heart/"&gt;congestive heart failure&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Since the plastic exposure came only from placing hot liquid in the containers — without any microwaving — this study suggests that simply eating hot food from plastic takeout containers may be enough to increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement this data, the researchers also asked 3,200 people to complete a survey about their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;exposure to plastic&lt;/a&gt; and their cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that those who frequently ate from plastic containers seemed to have more heart problems, particularly congestive heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has some shortcomings. First, researchers could not assess precisely which plastics the rats had in their bodies, nor did any of the rodents develop full-scale cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the human study was based on self-reported findings rather than lab results, and the researchers acknowledge that the link between the takeout containers and the cardiovascular symptoms could be due to other factors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, this is the latest evidence suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722069340" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;microplastics in food service&lt;/a&gt; can cause serious health problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors acknowledged that “further research is necessary to elucidate the health impacts of long-term exposure to plastic products.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, while it might sound extreme, they recommended that “in the meantime, to prevent ongoing harm from plastic products to human health, it is essential to avoid using plastic containers for high-temperature food.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep could be key to forestalling slow declines in brain health that may one day lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152995" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their 2023 study of 62 older, cognitively healthy adults, researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley, Stanford University, and UC Irvine in the US found individuals with brain changes associated with Alzheimer's performed better on memory function tests as they got more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was irrespective of education and physical activity, two factors along with social connection known to contribute to cognitive resilience in older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with similar Alzheimer's-linked changes who failed to get as much deep sleep didn't fare quite as well on the same tests. &lt;span&gt;By comparison, sleep made little difference to those individuals with few deposits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results, which were published in May 2023, imply having a generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory getting dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer's disease pathology," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of California (UC) Berkeley neuroscientist Matthew Walker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is especially exciting because we can do something about it. There are ways we can improve sleep, even in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143047" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Older lady sleeping " class="size-full wp-image-143047" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143047" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold. (&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/an-elderly-woman-sleeping-8527648/"&gt;Ron Lach/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study echoes &lt;a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2020/sep/sleep-apnea-alzheimers"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; which has found a build-up of amyloid-beta proteins in the brains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/link-between-alzheimer-s-disease-and-sleep-apnea-discovered-in-brain-tissue"&gt;people with disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But poor sleep is both a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;risk factor for&lt;/a&gt; and a symptom of Alzheimer's disease, making it tricky to tease apart cause and effect. Likewise, clumpy amyloid-beta proteins might only be a sign of Alzheimer's disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;not its root cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, levels of amyloid-beta proteins are commonly used as a marker of Alzheimer's disease, as research suggests they – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-find-biological-changes-visible-up-to-30-years-before-alzheimer-s-symptoms-appear"&gt;another protein called tau&lt;/a&gt; – can start clogging up brain cells decades before symptoms of the disease arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research from Walker's group found significant levels of amyloid-beta aggregating in the brains of older adults can disrupt deep sleep – also known as non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep – and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4035"&gt;impair memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some folk appear to stave off the decline that comes with Alzheimer's disease, even when levels of amyloid-beta proteins are relatively high. To find out why, Walker and colleagues monitored participants' brain waves as they slept, and then asked them to complete a memory test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those whose brain scans revealed similarly high levels of beta-amyloid deposits, getting a good night's sleep seemed to make a critical difference in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect was only seen when the researchers looked specifically at non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep, and not at other sleep wave frequencies or sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg" alt="Illustration of Brains " class="size-full wp-image-143046" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-434x415.jpg 434w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-600x574.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In people with similar amounts of beta-amyloid protein deposits, more deep sleep corresponded with improved memory function. (&lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;Matthew Walker/UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term studies in older adults are needed to test whether increasing deep sleep over a number of years can actually help preserve a person's cognitive function in that time, even as levels of amyloid-beta increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research adds to scores of studies suggesting that sleep could be a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00146/full"&gt;modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, one that could potentially forestall molecular changes by giving the brain time to clean up waste products that accumulate during the day. It also points to sleep quality being important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a certain level of brain pathology, you're not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UC Berkeley neuroscientist and lead author Zsófia Zavecz &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the study findings in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people may display molecular changes indicating a progression toward Alzheimer's disease, Zavecz says their findings suggest lifestyle factors can help buffer against those effects. "One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep," she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, though small, also hints at why getting good sleep naturally might be a better option than taking sleeping pills to get some shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research shows users of sleeping pills &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sleeping-pill-may-reduce-the-build-up-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;appear to have lower levels of amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; in their cerebrospinal fluid, which washes the brain clean at night. But these medications come with side effects; they may also lull people into shallow bouts of sleep rather than deep sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, to set yourself up for a good night's sleep, Zavecz suggests cutting out  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="152995" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; late in the day, doing some exercise, avoiding screen time, and taking a hot shower before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you snooze, rest assured scientists are working hard to figure out the knotty problems of Alzheimer's disease, which affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in May 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But don't count it out too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Blue light is vilified sometimes,” Dr. Winter says. “While there is a problem with being exposed to blue light before you go to bed, there is technically nothing wrong with blue light in general.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-help-with-sleep-in-older-adults" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does it help with sleep in older adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The study just found a link between morning blue light exposure and better activity and sleep, but experts say there’s likely a major reason why an early dose of this light wavelength was helpful: “[It] can help regulate your circadian rhythm,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/giacomina-massaro-giordano" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/giacomina-massaro-giordano" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mina Massaro-Giordano," class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Mina Massaro-Giordano,&lt;/a&gt; MD, co-director of the Penn Dry Eye and Ocular Surface Center and a professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with this term, your circadian rhythm is your body’s natural 24-hour cycle. It helps regulate a slew of physiological and behavioral processes in your body, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). Exposure to light and darkness have the biggest impact on your circadian rhythm, per the NIH. Essentially, these two modes can signal to your body that it's time to get up or to wind down for bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So, in the morning, blue light can be helpful. Dr. Winter even calls it "awesome." Why? “It can help your body wake up for the day," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;And it's &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; helpful for older adults due to biological changes that affect our eyes' light receptors, says study co-author &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen__;!!Ivohdkk!mK2T8FqX4tcxIeIjjZBG1qNqDurLDLRg0ElnoVyW6XKdduL7enyqxtvyWuqfEmzgk7P1yffQHkS2wLjkneGEWA$" title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen__;!!Ivohdkk!mK2T8FqX4tcxIeIjjZBG1qNqDurLDLRg0ElnoVyW6XKdduL7enyqxtvyWuqfEmzgk7P1yffQHkS2wLjkneGEWA$" data-outlook-id="8bdd4a2f-3d19-470f-af14-3167edc7d734" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen__;!!Ivohdkk!mK2T8FqX4tcxIeIjjZBG1qNqDurLDLRg0ElnoVyW6XKdduL7enyqxtvyWuqfEmzgk7P1yffQHkS2wLjkneGEWA$" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daan van der Veen" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Daan van der Veen&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, senior lecturer in Sleep and Chronobiology at the University of Surrey. "Normally, our circadian clocks stay synchronized with the day-night cycle through special blue light receptors in our eyes," he says. "But as we age, our ability to perceive this light declines due to natural changes like yellowing or clouding of the eye’s lens and a loss of light-sensitive cells in the retina."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For older adults, early morning blue light exposure may help support good sleep and activity, van der Veen says. "This may not work for everybody, [but] it does give real-world evidence that this simple and affordable approach could potentially help many people enjoy better sleep as they age, just by making sure they get the right kind of light at the right time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-help-with-activity-in-older-adults" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does it help with activity in older adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It’s all linked, Dr. Winter says. What he means is that being exposed to blue light in the morning can help reinforce the message going to your brain and body that it’s time to get up and be active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If you wake up in the morning and sit in a dark house, it doesn’t allow your brain to understand that it’s daytime,” Dr. Winter says. But getting an early hit of blue light can help signal that you should get moving, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-i-get-more-blue-light-exposure" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I get more blue light exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While this study used special lights, Dr. Winter says that getting out in the sun or even sitting near a light window during the day can also give you a dose of blue light. And he recommends doing what you can to get that sunlight exposure early. Try opening your shades as soon as you get up or eating breakfast next to a window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just keep in mind that blue light exposure at night can throw your circadian rhythm off, so it's best to avoid scrolling on your phone or working on your computer before you hop in bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

They found a correlation between greater exposure to extreme heat and a bigger jump in epigenetic age. A person living in a place where the heat index is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above for half the year experienced up to 14 more months of biological aging compared to someone living somewhere with less than 10 days a year that hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“The thing that is interesting here is that a lot of observational data focuses on acute impacts of extreme heat exposure – this paper underlines that there may be chronic impacts on epigenetic age that are important predictors of adverse health,” Amruta Nori-Sarma, deputy director of Harvard Chan C-CHANGE and assistant professor of environmental health and population sciences says in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Nori-Sarma and Choi say it’s important to keep in mind, however, that the study doesn’t take into consideration whether a person had access to air conditioning or other ways to stay cool. There’s room for more research into what factors might make an individual more resilient or more vulnerable to heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“Our finding doesn’t necessarily mean that every person living in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, has an older biological age. This is really an average impact,” Choi says. “Two people in the same neighborhood could have very different levels of personal exposure depending on whether they have air conditioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;That also shows that there are steps that can be taken to keep people safe in a warming world. Aside from stopping climate change, that can look like planting more trees and painting rooftops white to &lt;a href="/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;prevent urban areas from trapping as much heat&lt;/a&gt;, and opening up more public spaces where people can get access to air conditioning. Finding solutions gets easier to do when people are more aware of the potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Verge</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:43:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPbVllUjdIWkJuWEdHVUVOU2VXcUZGYUVaOE16ZU9CQW82b1hBSE5lTVZQdU9mdVZZVEkwbU0zMlVyNHBGTDRkN2tLNVl6Z3pEUXN2NU9XVzFWLS1wTjN2UWJMdkdVTVZPQnFwYlVqekZyWGVtOWlvUGtFWm9ERTdWOQ</guid></item><item><title>Texas child is first reported US measles death in a decade as outbreak hits more than 130 people - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQMU5DWUNxUFRpYTd6UzdMMEJ1S0xsWmRDV1R1VUp3cHY1d2xIM3lXR3plczc1NUtGXzlXUnozZ2lhcE9kcnlYcVZTTGozS0k2WWlpMmVtMU5rV0pabWpNU19STGhqcTlObVB5RHVxa0xiVmZGckFRRkpDLXFmcE5iN3c2MHJUTzRRNW01ZEhLbHdBN1RTdkhoOXhSbmJpTWI0cHA0N2U4WlFXYVh2OWh4Q1NVeVE2R29nT3cySkh1b3ZKZWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQMU5DWUNxUFRpYTd6UzdMMEJ1S0xsWmRDV1R1VUp3cHY1d2xIM3lXR3plczc1NUtGXzlXUnozZ2lhcE9kcnlYcVZTTGozS0k2WWlpMmVtMU5rV0pabWpNU19STGhqcTlObVB5RHVxa0xiVmZGckFRRkpDLXFmcE5iN3c2MHJUTzRRNW01ZEhLbHdBN1RTdkhoOXhSbmJpTWI0cHA0N2U4WlFXYVh2OWh4Q1NVeVE2R29nT3cySkh1b3ZKZWc</guid></item><item><title>Eleanor Maguire, Neuroscientist Who Studied the Brains of London Cabdrivers, Dies at 54 - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1CNGpFUW00d3JvNmMwZzRJTjBQempLMXh4M0hLaVhsZ3BrRnZPR2RWQjEyQ1hyMndTNXp1MU9Pd01TbmdCaWh3LVh1SjBxVF9ZcW0yMGNVT3JEMEdnc2JkVnp3MlA4N1li?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1CNGpFUW00d3JvNmMwZzRJTjBQempLMXh4M0hLaVhsZ3BrRnZPR2RWQjEyQ1hyMndTNXp1MU9Pd01TbmdCaWh3LVh1SjBxVF9ZcW0yMGNVT3JEMEdnc2JkVnp3MlA4N1li</guid></item><item><title>CDC shares clinical and sequencing details from 3 recent human H5N1 cases - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPby03R2pDYkZUeVJ1T212SGctUVZCbXpYV3VTM05vVzdkcFlGYml6c0FBd2d0SjZnQ2NZUWg3T0hOdXdnWmJpcVlzek5FS0VYNGhRQ3dubVNHRGdjejltTEM2dld2U0U3cUZPWDdMSmMwUXk2U3FMRXRJUjB6TC1heUpKUjR2VWRUWWlnZC1hTzlGTnUwdEduQjI4dno1cmY3bVlTLWNIUVBBTUoyNHN4bzdtRXNDU0w3VndSZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) today announced a new round of funding targeting therapeutics for gram-negative bacterial infections and rapid diagnostics for typhoid fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards for gram-negative therapeutics will be restricted to direct-acting small-molecule therapeutics that demonstrate activity against both susceptible and multidrug-resistant organisms, with a preference for products with both intravenous and oral step-down options. New antibiotics for gram-negative pathogens, which are a leading cause of deaths from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), have been a focus for CARB-X since its inception in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For typhoid fever diagnostics, CARB-X is interested in affordable, easy-to-use tests for diagnosing acute infections caused by &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt; serovar Typhi in low-resource settings. An estimated 11 million to 21 million cases of typhoid fever occur each year, primarily among people in low- and middle-income countries in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New antibiotics needed for gram-negative pathogens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Although progress has been made in the discovery and early development of therapeutics addressing various AMR challenges, there is broad agreement that we still need a new antibiotic, particularly an orally available one, with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens," Erin Duffy, PhD, CARB-X's chief of research and development, said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://carb-x.org/carb-x-news/carb-x-launches-2025-funding-round-targeting-global-infectious-disease-threats/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. "At the same time, fast, affordable, and accessible diagnostics for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;S. typhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are essential to improve early detection and treatment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CARB-X says applicants from around the world, particularly countries in which the AMR burden is high, are encouraged to apply. Proposals can be submitted from April 16 through April 30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since 2016, CARB-X has supported 113 early-stage projects designed to prevent, treat, and diagnose antibiotic-resistant infections. Of those projects, 19 have advanced into or completed clinical trials, 12 remain active in clinical development, and 2 products have reached the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Lung perfusion, or how blood flows in and out of the lungs, can thus be hard to detect in pediatric patients.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging without contrasts or radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of radiation exposure and the necessity for intravenous contrast agent, CT [computed tomography] is not used as a standard diagnostic tool in children suspected of having PCC," the authors wrote. "Instead, pulmonary function tests and echocardiography, along with a comprehensive review of medical history, are performed to rule out pulmonary and cardiac differential diagnoses. However, these examinations frequently show normal lung and cardiac function in symptomatic patients, complicating the diagnostic process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PREFUL MRI, however, is a contrast agent–free and radiation-free imaging modality that may be more suitable for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, 54 participants (27 with long COVID and 27 without) underwent PREFUL from April 2022 to April 2023. The imaging assessed regional ventilation (oxygen flow), flow-volume loop correlation metric (FVL-CM), quantified perfusion (blood flow), ventilation and perfusion defect percentages, and ventilation-perfusion ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median age of participants was 15 years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung injuries linked to chronic fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PREFUL results showed that kids with long COVID had lung injuries that correlated to specific long-COVID symptoms and overall loss of blood flow in the lungs. In participants with long COVID, greater lung perfusion correlated with increased chronic fatigue severity. In addition, higher ventilation-perfusion mismatch correlated with increased heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research provides the first comprehensive evidence of measurable regional lung perfusion abnormalities in pediatric post-COVID-19 condition using radiation-free, contrast-free lung imaging," said Gesa H. Pöhler, MD, &lt;u&gt;a senior physician&lt;/u&gt; at the Hannover Medical School in Germany and first author of the study, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074080"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Radiological Society of North America, which publishes the journal.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said PREFUL could also be used on long-COVID patients to determine how or if they are improving.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quantitative lung MRI establishes a potential imaging biomarker profiling and helps to enable disease severity follow-up for this complex condition in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quantitative lung MRI establishes a potential imaging biomarker profiling and helps to enable disease severity follow-up for this complex condition in the future," Pöhler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded, "Further investigations should prioritize multicenter longitudinal studies with larger cohorts to validate these findings and evaluate the progression of lung abnormalities at various stages after COVID-19 infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But could it also affect how their DNA functions, and accelerate the aging process itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study,&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, suggests it could. The analysis of over 3,600 older adults in the United States found that those living in neighborhoods prone to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/10/well/live/heat-body-dehydration-health.html" title=""&gt;extreme heat&lt;/a&gt; — classified as 90 degrees or above — showed more accelerated aging at a molecular level compared with those in areas less prone to extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings suggest that heat waves and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/09/climate/2024-heat-record-climate-goal.html" title=""&gt;rising temperatures&lt;/a&gt; from climate change could be chemically modifying people’s DNA and speeding up their biological aging. The study authors estimated that a person living in an area that reached 90 degrees or above for 140 days or more in a year could age up to 14 months faster than someone in an area with fewer than 10 extreme heat days a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed three biomarker aging estimates, known as epigenetic clocks, which were derived from blood samples of people age 56 and older as part of a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/resource/health-and-retirement-study-hrs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;separate national population study&lt;/a&gt;. They then looked at these age estimates alongside six years of daily climate data, comparing them across geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Epigenetic clocks measure biological changes that could predict the future risk of disease or death associated with older age. They estimate “how well the body is functioning at the molecular and the cellular level,” said Eun Young Choi, a postdoctoral associate at the U.S.C. Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and a co-author on the paper. While DNA is fixed at birth, external factors like stress or pollution can trigger molecular changes that turn genes on and off and affect how they operate. “DNA is like a blueprint,” Dr. Choi said, but these &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/well/live/aging-biology-dna.html" title=""&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; are like the “switchboard that controls which part of the blueprint gets activated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This is the first population-level analysis to establish a connection between heat exposure and epigenetic aging in humans, building on separate research finding similar changes in &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978736/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33037634/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4769883/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;guinea pigs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

I know her doctor can’t discuss her case with me, but would it be wrong for me to voice my concerns, given the potential risks? &lt;/em&gt;— Name Withheld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;From the Ethicist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In general, a psychiatrist will know if patients aren’t keeping on top of their blood work and other safety requirements — the lab results will typically be sent to their office. Still, nothing stops you from sharing your concerns with the doctor. Just keep in mind that a responsible psychiatrist may feel that patients have the right to know about communications regarding their care. If she later learned you contacted the doctor without her knowledge, after all, she could feel that a paternalistic alliance was formed behind her back. So assume that your message may be shared with her. Your right to voice concerns doesn’t come with a right to confidentiality — and what feels like protection to you may feel like betrayal to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-2upsz0 eoo0vm40" id="link-66bb32fb"&gt;A Bonus Question&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;My 12-year-old son, a seventh grader, was found watching pornography on his iPad. When investigating where he got the link to this site from, we found it had been sent by a friend in their chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;While we now have implemented parental controls and had a conversation about this with our son, we don’t know if we should inform the parents of this other child about what’s happened. We saw that the link came through their chat, but we can’t tell for sure whether his friend saw it, too, or just forwarded it. We have no idea what the parents know, or how we would even approach the topic with them, or how well it would go over with them if we did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;The easiest thing would be to forget about the whole situation and move on. But we feel that may be morally regrettable. &lt;/em&gt;— Name Withheld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;From the Ethicist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents are always measuring their children’s progress to make sure they aren’t lagging behind. As you remind us, though, there are areas where their lagging behind would suit us just fine. What’s unusual about the situation you describe, I’m afraid, is just that your son was caught. To judge from several studies, he’s at the age when American youth, on average, first view pornography. In her 2021 book ‘‘Pornography and Public Health,’’ Emily F. Rothman, a public-health expert at Boston University, notes that an interest in sexual imagery at that age makes sense, developmentally speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

She had so much to update her old classmates about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as they gathered a restaurant in 2023, she told them how she'd recently used an at-home DNA test and had been left stunned to discover that her dad was not her biological father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained how she'd made the grim discovery that her real dad was actually her mother's &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fertility/index.html" id="mol-82533620-ee3a-11ef-a650-0b07d75b23bb"&gt;fertility&lt;/a&gt; doctor, who'd impregnated her with his &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;own &lt;/span&gt;sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor had done it to other women too and, as a result, Victoria had dozens of half brothers and sisters she'd never met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was at the moment she &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-82569180-ee3a-11ef-a650-0b07d75b23bb"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; seeing her high school boyfriend's expression cloud over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You could see him melting a little bit, his affect changed, and he got really quiet,' Victoria, now 40 and a married mom-of-two, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shocking truth is that her former boyfriend, who does not wish to be named, was also conceived through fertility treatment and was among Victoria's new club of mystery half-siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As teenagers, the young southern &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-825b7380-ee3a-11ef-a650-0b07d75b23bb" class="class"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; couple had been 'inseparable' and intimate for about a year, and could well have settled down had they not gone off to college and taken different paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-443301" data-gramm="false"&gt;Victoria Hill, 40, a married mom-of-two, has been on an emotional rollercoaster since she used an at-home DNA kit in 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-gramm="false"&gt;Victoria's mom, Maralee, is now suing the doctor who helped her conceive two children in the 1980s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for Victoria – who now works as a clinical social worker – such sweet teenage recollections now lie in tatters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After all, they'd been engaging in accidental incest – which raised troubling issues for both of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also raised tough questions about the oversight of fertility care in the 1970s and 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria says it's been an uneasy and 'surreal' experience, and one of 'cognitive dissonance'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You would think that when you find out you are siblings with someone, that a switch would turn off,' she told the Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But those feelings don't go away, which makes it really gross and complicated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria always knew that her parents had struggled to have children and underwent fertility care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also often felt something was 'off' about her relationship with her dad as they were so different, but never doubted he was her biological father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would joke when I was younger that I wasn't actually my dad's child, I was the mailman's,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The process of discovery started in 2020, when Victoria developed a health complication that is often genetic, but for which her parents had never suffered any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So she bought a 23andMe DNA testing kit and sent off her samples to the genomics company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were stunning, showing that she had more siblings than just the brother she had grown up with – with the count now standing at 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of them reached out and revealed that her biological dad was Burton &lt;span&gt;Caldwell, a fertility doctor and Yale University professor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-919928" data-gramm="false"&gt;A teenage Victoria, pictured with her high school boyfriend, and half-brother, who does not wish to be named&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-880428" data-gramm="false"&gt;Burton Caldwell poses for a selfie with another of his many donor-kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He'd used his own sperm to inseminate Victoria's mother, Maralee, allegedly without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria immediately confronted her mother, who she soon realized had not been fully transparent about the treatment she had undergone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fertility medicine was making great strides in the 70s and early 80s, and ethical standards and practices had not yet matured. It was not uncommon then for clinicians to use their own sperm, or samples from medical students and interns, as fresh specimens were preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, samples were also mixed up, and the male donor's identity was a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maralee and other hopeful moms were told not to ask too many questions and to count any pregnancy as a blessing, says Victoria who, after several heart-wrenching talks with her mother, acknowledges that Maralee 'did the best she could with the information that she had at that time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the bombshells kept dropping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria learned that many families in the same area had used Caldwell, whose clinic was in nearby New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria ultimately discovered that she had gone to school with at least four of her siblings without knowing about it at the time – her high school sweetheart being among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It transpired that her ex-boyfriend's mom had also been treated at Caldwell's clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He did 23andMe and then, within a few more weeks, he sent me the [message] that said: "You are my sister".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The revelation was tough to navigate. Victoria and her former boyfriend had been 'inseparable' friends for years before enjoying an 'unconditional love' when they dated for about a year, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We now have to figure out how to turn that love into a sibling sort of love; we're both struggling with it,' she admits, adding that she still grapples with the 'attraction that pulls us together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It makes sense why we were so incredibly comfortable together and unconditional with each other, especially at a high school age,' she says. 'I thought it was rare, but now I understand it's because we share 24 percent of our DNA.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-619141" data-gramm="false"&gt;The shocking message Victoria Hill received from her high school boyfriend after he received his DNA test results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-686452" data-gramm="false"&gt;Victoria now worries about what will happen to her own kids when they grow up and start dating, with so many first cousins in the community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria also struggles to manage her feelings toward her true biological dad, revealing that she felt compelled to knock on Caldwell's door at his Connecticut home seeking answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What she discovered was an old and infirm man but one who appears to have no regrets about fathering so many children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He simply explained that was the role of a fertility doctor back then, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think he's a narcissist,' she says. 'I spend my career psychoanalyzing people, and I can't do it for him.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell had little interest in striking up a relationship with his new-found 'daughter', Victoria says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm grateful I'm alive. I love my blue eyes, my intelligence, my athleticism, and that's from him, because he thought he was this elite person,' she says. 'But, I also don't think that I should be a product of fraud, and my mother shouldn't have been subjected to medical abuse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victoria's mother, Maralee, is among four patients who are suing Caldwell in two separate lawsuits, alleging that he used his own sperm to inseminate patients without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's variously accused in the lawsuits of misconduct, inflicting emotional distress, assault and battery, failure to obtain informed consent, fraud, fraudulent concealment and other torts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January, state Superior Court Judge Robin Wilson ordered Yale to participate in discovery in the lawsuits by providing documents related to Caldwell from 1974 to 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale entities named in the ruling include Yale New Haven Hospital, Yale University, also known as Yale School of Medicine, and Yale New Haven Health Services Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell, his lawyer, and Yale did not answer the Mail's requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Yale New Haven Health spokesperson said 'there is no evidence' of its 'involvement in the conduct alleged against Dr. Caldwell.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-643051" data-gramm="false"&gt;The mom-of-two is a clinical social worker from southern Connecticut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-850053" data-gramm="false"&gt;Victoria says lawmakers and the courts need to get tougher on dodgy doctors who commit 'fertility fraud'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-717189" data-gramm="false"&gt;Yale School of Medicine (pictured) has been ordered to hand over documents about any work with Dr Caldwell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such cases have become more common thanks to at-home DNA testing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in five Americans have taken a mail-in DNA test, recent YouGov polling shows.

However, as Nickel noted: “These tests carry the potential for healthy people to receive unnecessary diagnoses, which could lead to unnecessary medical treatments or impact mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said she was struck by the “really personal narratives” being used: “Fearmongering that if you don’t do this test, you’re not taking care of your own health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For example, despite the science of the gut microbiome test being in its very early stages, an Instagram account with over 65,000 followers promoted the test to its followers, telling them: “You DESERVE to be healthy. It is your BIRTHRIGHT. These tests will let us know with CERTAINTY what is causing your specific health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Researchers involved in the study found the overwhelming majority of posts (87.1%) mentioned benefits of the tests, with harms mentioned by less than 15% of posts, and only 6% mentioned overdiagnosis or overuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A promotional tone was used in 83.8% of posts – more than half (50.7%) encouraged viewers to take action and get the test, and 68% of account holders had financial interests involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Posts from doctors were more likely to mention harms and less likely to have an overall promotional tone but Nickel said in some cases they were also “really strongly promoting the test”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One medical doctor with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more than 65,000 followers on TikTok promoted the multi-cancer early detection test to their followers, telling them: “As you get older the chance of cancer is pretty high, if you do this test yearly then you’ll pretty much catch cancer early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;We should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/01/expert-says-overdiagnosis-means-australian-cancer-screening-tests-must-be-handled-very-carefully" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harms of cancer overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; were most clear, Nickel said, with both the full-body MRI and multi-cancer early detection test promoted as a way to identify early forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Overdiagnosis refers to the diagnosis of very early forms of disease that are unlikely to cause any symptoms or problems but knowledge of which can do more harm than good, leading to psychological stress and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/09/overdiagnosis-some-breast-cancer-treatments-may-have-been-unnecessary-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unnecessary treatments including major surgery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition to concerns about overdiagnosis, there were the financial costs of the tests themselves (full-body MRIs cost upwards of $800 in Australia) and of costly interventions pursued as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Despite egg-timer tests being &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dont-believe-the-hype-egg-timer-tests-cant-reliably-predict-your-chance-of-conceiving-or-menopause-timing-207008" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unable to reliably predict a woman’s chance of conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, Nickel said there were concerns women who received low results may experience unnecessary anxiety, and go down the path of elective egg freezing or IVF interventions when they may not have been needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said the test “preys on the insecurity” of women regarding their future capacity to conceive, noting it was often promoted to younger women who might be years away from the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A medical doctor with more than 70,000 TikTok followers promoted the test: “Whether you’re in your teens or 30s, empowering yourself with fertility knowledge is extremely important. For women, age is not a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The testosterone test was most closely linked to promotion of treatments or supplements, and often carried “really clear narratives around masculinity”, Nickel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A TikTok account with close to 100,000 followers promoted the testosterone test by telling followers: “Watch out for this scary sign of low testosterone levels … You should be waking up in the morning with a boner. If you’re not waking up in the morning with a boner there’s a large possibility you have a low testosterone level. Get it checked!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said there were also potential dangers for men taking some testosterone supplements because of a lack of long-term evidence around safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She said the problem overall was that because these tests were often sold direct to consumers, they “take the middle man – the doctor – out of the equation” and the space for a person to discuss with a medical professional whether they need the test or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Stacy Carter, the director of the Australian Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Engagement, Evidence and Values at the University of Wollongong, said the study used robust methods and “shows clearly that influential social media posts promote testing and talk up the alleged benefits of testing – even when tests are useless, or potentially harmful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study adds to the evidence that medical misinformation is common on social media, and suggests we should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested,” Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said stronger regulation was needed so that the onus was not on individuals to see through the misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOTjMwZmRpYmZLS3ZLd19fWEFVQWdEM1l4d1NqVjhBcGZnTmQzUDZWdTBYSWFRTUVYT0duWlVGZGNrUndJMGJrOGRIY3ZBY3QzOGZFMF9xRGdZQ3pnVEE1ZU9lZl9PeDZlZ3prR1cxY1V0MjZ3X0o4RGdOdlhCbHQ1b0lRQmxiVmtxdGxHRWtYdHAyZVlQcmY1TWJNUkhrYVM2ZGJwU29ROXQ3dnZVLWduUWNyZ2pLalZKcHRJT1dNNnpuYWZkS1dzTDVSUjgtbXI2RGZXUHc5eVZRVmhCNmc1cHZB</guid></item><item><title>Brewing tea can remove lead and other heavy metals from water, new study finds - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQc1NsSlVncmd0ZDY3a1ZRdVZYY3RkczdCTHNHbUhERmgzZnNsYjd2WDR0S1hqaC0tNkJqUDgwXzdZZEtaeE03MWVWelk4Sm5DVXRzZmxkbHBCTlV3cDFMaDJOX290azBxN0FoOEhBZWtESW5oZjhMcGtiU2dFQnRPbUZRdUhEOTVZMm9TT2R3OWk1Vm9WNlB2Y0dyS3hKckhqMnJmM2FkdlhIMktMTHhjYlpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brewing tea could help to remove toxic heavy metals, including lead, from drinking water, a new study has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good cup of tea has long been associated with numerous slight health benefits, but previous studies have tended to focus on the effects of chemicals in the tea leaves that are released during brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has revealed that the brewing process removes charged atoms (called ions) from heavy metals in water, seemingly by chemically bonding with them. This, in turn, makes the heavy metals stick to the tea leaves, pulling them from the water. The study was published Monday (Feb. 24) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.4c01030" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.4c01030" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACS Food and Science Technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not suggesting that everyone starts using tea leaves as a water filter," co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/dravid-vinayak.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/dravid-vinayak.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vinayak Dravid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of materials science at Northwestern University, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074361?" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074361?" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Past research linked these benefits to the chemicals released in the plants, but the researchers behind the new study suspected it could also be something to do with the brewing process itself. (Heavy metals have been tied to increased risk of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568163724003167" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568163724003167" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38662861/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38662861/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5AVPoMpYH6QHdE8nyNhXY5" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5AVPoMpYH6QHdE8nyNhXY5 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate their hypothesis, the scientists purchased a number of teas, from the popular Lipton and Infusion brands, that include black tea, green tea, chamomile tea, oolong tea, white peony tea and rooibos tea. (Chamomile and rooibos are steeped and drunk as tea but come from a different family of plants than traditional teas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By brewing their teas in the same manner as regular drinkers do, the researchers tested the teas' ability to neutralize heavy metal ions in waters of varying concentrations by comparing them to water-based mixtures without tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results revealed that a typical cup of tea — one mug of water and one teabag, brewed for three to five minutes — can remove roughly 15% of lead from water with lead concentrations up to 10 parts per million. While there is no safe level for lead in public drinking water, the Environmental Protection Agency sets the actionable limit at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/lead-food-and-foodwares" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/lead-food-and-foodwares" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;15 parts per billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Brewing reduced other metal ions too, including chromium and cadmium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other trends also appeared. The type of tea bag made a big difference, with cotton and nylon bags adsorbing barely any contaminants and cellulose bags removing the most. Additionally, the tea type and how finely it was ground also played a role, with finely ground black tea leaves being the best performers. These, alongside green and white teas, reduced lead ion concentrations to a greater degree than oolong, rooibos and camomile teas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most significant factor was the steeping time. Perhaps predictably, teas left to brew the longest removed the most contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any tea that steeps for longer or has higher surface area will effectively remediate more heavy metals," first-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vpd.ms.northwestern.edu/people/alumni/benjamin-shindel.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://vpd.ms.northwestern.edu/people/alumni/benjamin-shindel.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Benjamin Shindel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a materials scientist at Northwestern University, said in the statement. "Some people brew their tea for a matter of seconds, and they are not going to get a lot of remediation. But brewing tea for longer periods or even overnight — like iced tea — will recover most of the metal or maybe even close to all of the metal in the water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite the promise of their findings, the researchers say that they do come with caveats. Firstly, in areas of the world with good water systems it's unlikely that metal concentrations will reach high enough levels for teas to confer any enormous benefits. And secondly, if there is a water contamination crisis, tea will not solve the problem on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not to say that drinking more tea might not be a good idea anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Across a population, if people drink an extra cup of tea per day, maybe over time we'd see declines in illnesses that are closely correlated with exposure to heavy metals," Shindel said. "Or it could help explain why populations that drink more tea may have lower incidence rates of heart disease and stroke than populations that have lower tea consumption."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking medical first, doctors have restored vision in children who were born almost completely blind. Four young children with a rare inherited eye disorder gained meaningful sight after a single gene therapy treatment​.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The children went from only being able to tell light from darkness to being able to recognize objects and shapes, and in some cases, even read. . sa consultant ophthalmologist involved in the trial, calling the outcomes &lt;em&gt;“hugely impressive”&lt;/em&gt; and a potential &lt;em&gt;“paradigm shift”&lt;/em&gt; in treating early blindness​.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have, for the first time, an effective treatment for the most severe form of childhood blindness,” said Professor Michel Michaelides, one of the researchers involved in the study. Michaelidis added that this is “pretty amazing” and “a potential paradigm shift” for children suffering from this condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-curing-blindness"&gt;Curing blindness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The four children were born with Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 4 (LCA4). This is a severe form of retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the AIPL1 gene. Children with this rare genetic defect are typically certified legally blind from birth and there are no conventional cures. Glasses or surgery can’t fix the problem because the root cause is a faulty gene preventing the eye’s light-sensing cells from working properly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;​This is where gene therapy comes in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The procedure consists of an injection containing healthy copies of the AIPL1 gene into the retina of one eye during a delicate “keyhole” surgery​. These copies are put inside a harmless virus, which helps them to enter the retinal cells and replace the defective gene. Researchers selected four children (from the US, Turkey, and Tunisia) for the trial. They received the therapy in only one eye.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of the surgeries went well. Here, the parents of one of the children, Jace, describe how quick the recovery was:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the operation, Jace was immediately spinning, dancing and making the nurses laugh. He started to respond to the TV and phone within a few weeks of surgery and, within six months, could recognise and name his favourite cars from several metres away; it took his brain time, though, to process what he could now see. Sleep can be difficult for children with sight loss, but he falls asleep much more easily now, making bedtimes an enjoyable experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, all four children experienced dramatic improvements in vision in their treated eye over the next several years​. They described considerable improvements in visual behaviour from 4 weeks after the intervention. By about 3–4 years after the gene therapy, tests showed the treated eyes improved from essentially zero vision to roughly 20/200 on the vision chart. When someone has 20/200 vision, it means that at 20 feet away from an eye chart, they can see only as much detail as a person with normal (20/20) vision would see at 200 feet. It’s not perfect, but it’s still a massive improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The parents of the children described the results as “amazing” and said they felt “lucky” to be involved in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-therapy-shows-great-potential"&gt;Gene therapy shows great potential&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several ophthalmological conditions can be addressed through gene therapy. X-linked &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/gene-therapy-new-retinitis-pigmentosa-lca-luxturna"&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt; (a progressive vision loss in boys) and &lt;a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/clinical-ophthalmology-research-group/trials/choroideremia-gene-therapy"&gt;choroideremia&lt;/a&gt; (an inherited disease that causes progressive damage the retina) are currently in clinical trials with gene therapies. Even common diseases such as age-related macular degeneration &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888617/"&gt;are being targeted&lt;/a&gt; with gene-based treatments. For example, gene therapy is being trialed for delivering long-term anti-VEGF drugs to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The eye has proven to be a fertile testing ground for gene therapy, but it’s not the only one. In 2019, the FDA approved a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) — a deadly neuromuscular disorder in infants — which has enabled babies who would have died before age two &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-innovative-gene-therapy-treat-pediatric-patients-spinal-muscular-atrophy-rare-disease#:~:text=The%20U,genetic%20cause%20of%20infant%20mortality"&gt;to grow up healthy&lt;/a&gt;. Another gene therapy has effectively cured certain patients with immunodeficiency disorders (often called “bubble boy” disease) &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/gene-therapy-works-bubble-boy-disease"&gt;by reprogramming their bone&lt;/a&gt; marrow cells with a correct gene. Trials are also underway for gene therapies for &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/01/revolutionary-gene-editing-therapy-for-sickle-cell/"&gt;sickle cell anemia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://haemophilia.org.uk/gene-therapy-haemophilia-b/"&gt;hemophilia&lt;/a&gt;, and various metabolic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of these successes, like the one for AIPL1 blindness, can have transformational power in the lives of many.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-promising-future"&gt;A promising future&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These treatments, however, won’t come overnight. Manufacturing them is complex and often extremely expensive. Scaling up production may cut down on some of the costs, but it’s not clear how much. There are also scientific hurdles to overcome: not all genes are as straightforward to deliver as AIPL1 or RPE65. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some genetic eye diseases are caused by very large genes or by mutations in many different genes, requiring alternative strategies like gene editing or RNA therapies. Lastly, regulators and health systems will need to adapt to evaluate and provide these one-time treatments that can have lifelong benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, the progress is undeniable. Gene therapy, once seen as a futuristic idea, is rapidly becoming a real-world solution for blindness and other health conditions. Something that wasn’t even imaginable a few decades ago is now a reality. Doctors involved in the trial are working on the next steps. They aim to treat the second eyes of these children now that safety is clear and to open the therapy to more patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2824%2902812-5"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a modest reduction in the risk of obesity-related cancers, according to research conducted by the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The study found a 6% lower cancer risk among participants with high Mediterranean diet adherence, independent of adiposity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In the study, "Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Obesity-Linked Cancer Risk in EPIC," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830586" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, outcomes focused on the incidence of obesity-related cancers classified under the 2015 International Agency for Research on Cancer criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1992 and 2000, EPIC enrolled 521,324 participants aged 35 to 70 years across 23 centers in 10 European countries. This prospective cohort analysis included 450,111 participants after exclusions for baseline &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnoses, missing data, extreme energy intake ratios, and Greek cohort data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+intake/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary intake&lt;/a&gt; through validated country-specific questionnaires and calculated &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adherence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adherence&lt;/a&gt; using a 9-point Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDiet), categorizing participants into low (0–3), medium (4–6), or high (7–9) adherence groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential confounders, including smoking, physical activity, education, alcohol intake, height, total energy intake, and type 2 diabetes. Mediation analyses examined the roles of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a median follow-up of 14.9 years, 4.9% of participants developed obesity-related cancers. High MedDiet adherence was associated with a lower risk of these cancers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94) compared with low adherence. Medium adherence showed a similar though statistically insignificant inverse association. No significant mediation by BMI or WHR was observed.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Site-specific analyses revealed inverse associations between high Mediterranean diet adherence and colorectal (HR, 0.92), hepatocellular (HR, 0.52), and kidney (HR, 0.67) cancer risks. Medium adherence was associated with lower esophageal cancer risk (HR, 0.66). No significant associations emerged for hormone-related cancers in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results remained consistent across sensitivity analyses, including models excluding the first two years of follow-up and variations of the Mediterranean diet score without the alcohol component. Stratified analyses indicated stronger inverse associations among smokers and men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that higher adherence to the MedDiet may significantly reduce obesity-related cancer risks through mechanisms unrelated to adiposity. Further research is necessary to explore underlying biological pathways, including inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not part of this EPIC study, it is plausible that the lower cancer risk associated with higher MedDiet adherence could partly reflect reduced consumption of highly or ultra-processed foods rather than any positive health effects of the MedDiet itself. Individuals with high MedDiet adherence consume more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish. Highly processed foods are not part of the MedDiet index (i.e., eating more processed foods would lower MedDiet adherence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many recent studies, including several from EPIC, have consistently reported a positive association between higher processed food consumption and increased risk of various cancers. As MedDiet adherence inversely correlates with cancer risk, while processed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/food+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;food consumption&lt;/a&gt; exhibits the opposite trend, it could suggest that MedDiet benefits partly stem from the absence of these types of processed food products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another note for future research is the category of obesity-related cancers. The current study finds these inverse and adverse associations persist after adjusting for adiposity measures (body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio). Given the persistent associations after adiposity adjustment and emerging data on ultra-processed foods, future research could explore whether some obesity-related cancers are also processed-food-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching your hair gray and your skin crease has long been considered an inevitable part of life, but a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074293" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has revealed promising avenues for combating visible signs of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/health/controversial-supplements-can-get-rid-of-zombie-cells-that-speed-up-aging/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some antiaging skin care does employ hormones — mainly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-retinol-cream-serum/"&gt;retinol&lt;/a&gt; and tretinoin in topical retinoids, as well as estrogen, which treats symptoms related to menopause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in Germany have identified a much wider variety of hormones that may have the potential to turn back time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;German researchers have identified a wide variety of hormones that could have antiaging effects. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wayhome.studio  – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our paper highlights key hormone players that orchestrate pathways of skin aging such as degradation of connective tissue (leading to wrinkling), stem cell survival and loss of pigment (leading to hair graying),” said lead study author &lt;a href="https://www.growkudos.com/profile/Markus_B%C3%B6hm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Markus Böhm&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatology professor at the University of Münster.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the hormones we studied have antiaging properties and may be used in the future as agents to prevent skin aging.”   &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to better understand how hormones affect skin aging, so they focused on insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/health/you-may-be-able-to-delay-menopause-with-your-sex-life/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, retinoids and melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melatonin stood out as a promising antiaging treatment because it is a small, affordable and well-tolerated molecule that also acts as an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; and helps regulate energy production in cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most widely known as a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/health/dont-take-melatonin-supplements-for-insomnia-sleep-doctors/"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; can be found naturally in milk, which contains an amino acid called tryptophan that the body converts into melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melatonin, primarily known for helping you sleep, can be found naturally in tart cherries. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fortyforks – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melatonin can also be found in high amounts in nuts (especially almonds, pistachios and walnuts), some fish (tuna and salmon) and tart cherries — the key ingredient in the TikTok-famous &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/02/health/i-tried-the-sleepy-girl-mocktail-insomnia-cure-the-viral-fad-works-but-theres-one-problem/"&gt;Sleepy Girl Mocktail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the identified hormones had surprising effects on skin and hair aging, especially in people with certain genetic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at other hormones, such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (which controls skin color), hormones from the thyroid system, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/this-nasal-spray-might-be-the-cure-to-loneliness/"&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; and endocannabinoids (found in CBD products). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you get older, your skin experiences intrinsic aging — a natural process that follows the passage of time — and extrinsic aging — aging due to external factors, such as sun exposure, air pollution, smoking, poor diet, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/just-1-sleepless-night-is-as-bad-for-your-immune-system-as-obesity-study/"&gt;lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; and stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Some of the hormones we studied have antiaging properties and may be used in the future as agents to prevent skin aging,” lead study author Markus Böhm said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;triocean – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that these hormones could help protect skin from sun damage, slow signs of aging and influence hair pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/endrev/bnae034/8029650" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;journal Endocrine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Skin is not only a target for various hormones that control pathways of skin aging, but itself is certainly the largest and richest site for hormone production besides classical endocrine glands,” Böhm said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Further research into these hormones may offer opportunities to develop new therapeutics for treating and preventing skin aging.” &lt;/p&gt;

In short, it's even more evidence demonstrating the importance of COVID vaccines, not just for adults, but for kids as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an extremely important topic now that the Trump administration is &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administrations-attacks-on-science-in-first-30-days/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;systematically trying to defund scientific research&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/business/trumps-whiplash-policies-keep-pharmas-on-their-toes" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bizarre change of tune&lt;/a&gt;, considering Trump was behind a concerted effort called Operation Warp Speed in the early days of the pandemic to speed up the development of COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830556" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;one of the two studies&lt;/a&gt;, published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, a team of US-based pediatricians and CDC researchers found that COVID-19 vaccinations were associated with a 57 percent drop in the odds of developing one or more post-COVID condition symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the mRNA-based vaccines that have become commonplace since the global pandemic are highly effective at warding off long COVID in children aged five to 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that effectiveness is as relevant as it was during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that children should stay up to date with current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations as vaccination not only protects against severe COVID-19 illness but also protects against [long COVID]," the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830557" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;separate cohort study&lt;/a&gt;, also published this week in the same journal, found that "concerns that young athletes with COVID-19 would be at increased risk of myocarditis and sudden cardiac arrest" were unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers compared instances of cardiac deaths that occurred before and during the pandemic, and found "no increase" in either of these conditions after it struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/04/11/cdc-finds-no-link-between-covid-vaccines-and-cardiac-death-in-young-people/?sh=650e6ec1577f" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;builds on existing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that there's no link between the disease and cardiac death in young people. In early 2023, the media was awash with reports of young athletes reportedly suffering cardiac arrest as a result of a COVID infection, lingering rumors that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/damar-hamlin-cardiac-arrest-covid-anti-vaccine-heart-theories/672644/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;persisted&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccines-athlete-deaths-1500-989195878254" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;sustained efforts to debunk them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an especially pertinent topic now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken over as Trump's health secretary. Kennedy has previously questioned the scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don't cause autism and has denied that COVID vaccines have saved millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/rfk-jr-covid-19-vaccinations" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy's non-profit, the Children's Health Defense, reportedly tried to block new COVID vaccinations from being rolled out during the height of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where his staunchly anti-vaccine stance will leave the future role of vaccinations in the United States remains unclear at best. His appointment has already proven highly controversial.

              &lt;p&gt;Something is killing people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and no one knows what it is. World Health Organization officials have reported two clusters of a mystery illness in the area that has sickened hundreds and killed dozens in the past few weeks alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials in the African Region released the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380529/OEW7-1016022025.pdf"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt; on the situation last Thursday. So far, there have been 431 cases and 53 deaths attributed to an unknown illness in northwestern DRC dating back to January. Initial tests have ruled out established suspects like Ebola and Marburg, and it’s still unclear whether there’s a single culprit to blame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DRC officials reported the newest cases in mid-February. The largest and latest outbreak is occurring in Bomate Village, with at least 419 people sickened and 45 dead as of February 15. Several weeks earlier, a cluster of illness was also reported in Boloko Village. At least 12 cases and eight deaths were documented in Boloko and the nearby village of Danda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the two outbreaks are in the same region (the Équateur Province), it’s not certain yet whether they are truly connected. People in both outbreaks have experienced similar symptoms, which include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and headache. Some people have also experienced hemorrhaging (potentially life-threatening blood loss), but tests for Ebola and Marburg virus—well-known causes of hemorrhagic fever—have come up negative in both outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, it’s rapidly striking victims down. In nearly half of the deaths, people have succumbed to their illness within 48 hours, and the overall mortality rate is currently around 10%. The limited medical resources and general isolation of these villages is also hampering efforts to treat cases and identify the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The situation in Équateur Province presents significant public health risk, with two clusters of an unknown disease causing high morbidity and mortality,” WHO officials wrote in their report. “The remote geography and limited healthcare infrastructure exacerbate response challenges, with overwhelmed health facilities struggling to manage cases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unknown clusters of illness occasionally happen in the world, and usually, they’re eventually identified as something established. Last December, for instance, an &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-mysterious-illness-is-killing-people-in-southwestern-congo-2000534031"&gt;outbreak of a mystery deadly illness&lt;/a&gt; in a different part of the DRC was ultimately attributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congos-health-ministry-says-unknown-disease-is-severe-malaria-2024-12-17/"&gt;severe form of malaria&lt;/a&gt; (likely aided by high rates of malnutrition in the area). Rarely, however, these clusters do lead to the discovery of a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-mysterious-virus-is-sickening-people-in-china-1840857359"&gt;new disease-causing germ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, WHO officials say that the most likely possibilities for these latest outbreaks are malaria, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever, meningitis, or some other type of viral hemorrhagic fever. Perhaps significantly, the first cases in the earlier cluster were found in young children who had recently eaten a bat carcass just before becoming sick. Bats are known to carry many viruses and bacteria that can sicken humans, and they’re considered &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201648"&gt;a major risk&lt;/a&gt; for the spread of novel diseases that could spill over into humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials and extra medical supplies have been sent to the region to aid local doctors, and further genetic testing of patients’ samples is now underway.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

The M.R.I. could pick up on traces of cancer or other diseases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the post was too simple, the University of Sydney public health researcher Brooke Nickel thought when she saw it in August 2023. What about the possible harms, she wondered? The test might find an extremely early stage cancer that would lead to a patient receiving invasive treatment, even though it may never have progressed to something more serious. Ms. Kardashian’s post made it seem like there were only upsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That post, and others like it, prompted Dr. Nickel to look into how other celebrities and influencers promote increasingly popular medical tests such as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/well/live/mri-prenuvo-full-body-scan.html" title=""&gt;full-body M.R.I. scans&lt;/a&gt;. They also examined posts for products that claim to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/health/cancer-blood-tests.html" title=""&gt;detect cancer in blood&lt;/a&gt; or analyze &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/health/fertility-test-ovarian-reserve.html" title=""&gt;a hormone&lt;/a&gt; linked to fertility, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/well/live/men-tesosterone-tests-ads.html" title=""&gt;testosterone levels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/well/eat/gut-microbiome-health.html" title=""&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The results of that study, which scrutinized nearly 1,000 TikTok and Instagram posts from accounts with hundreds of millions of combined followers, were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday.&lt;/a&gt; The paper found that an overwhelming majority of these posts were misleading, painting an overly rosy picture of these tests and rarely including scientific evidence. Only 15 percent mentioned potential harms. And more than two-thirds came from accounts with financial ties to the products, like influencers offering discounts and receiving sales commissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If this is how patients are getting all their information, it’s really unfortunate, because it’s completely acting like medical tests are a new cool pair of sneakers,” said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, director of the Radiology Outcomes Research Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Eighteen have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life-threatening to anyone who is not protected against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors say the best way to protect against the disease is with two doses of a vaccine, which is usually administered to children as a combination measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine prevent more than 97 percent of measles infections, according to Texas health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The South Plains region of Texas, where the outbreak has been spreading, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; that lag significantly behind federal targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;New Mexico has also &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reported an outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, with nine cases in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state, on the Texas border. Four of those cases are children under the age of 18, all of whom are unvaccinated, according to Robert Nott, a spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Health. None of the cases in New Mexico have led to hospitalizations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The outbreak comes amid growing concerns among public health experts about declining vaccination rates and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/rfk-jr-hhs-senate-confirmation.html" title=""&gt;the confirmation of Robert F.

However, in the last year or so, this naturally occurring hormone has entered the limelight of social media. Indeed, you can find videos on TikTok discussing "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/do-you-have-cortisol-face-expert/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol face&lt;/a&gt;" with millions of views. Unfortunately, trends are rarely as simple as they appear and may have people jumping into action before learning what cortisol supplements even are and how they react in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;While cortisol supplements can be the right choice in some situations, it's essential to understand the myriad factors that come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cortisol, and how is it related to stress?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is often called the "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cortisol-why-this-important-stress-hormone-is-important-for-your-health/" target="_self"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;" and is released by the adrenal glands -- part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a bodily system that regulates the stress response --  when our bodies experience stress. It helps our bodies respond to threatening experiences while managing several facets of our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol regulates blood sugar, suppresses inflammation, regulates metabolism, is involved in our circadian rhythms and influences the fight-or-flight reaction. It's essential for survival. Because &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538239/#:~:text=Though%20widely%20known%20as%20the,production%20and%20secretion%20of%20cortisol." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone&lt;/a&gt;, and most of our body tissue has glucocorticoid receptors, cortisol can have a broad and ubiquitous effect throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary aspects can also influence our cortisol levels, according to &lt;a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/diogo-barardo/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Diogo Barardo&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., director of R&amp;amp;D at biotechnology company Novos Core. For instance, higher levels of sugar and saturated fats in a diet can negatively increase cortisol levels. Conversely, a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may lower cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond diet, though, several other factors can influence your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/stressed-tired-cortisol-imbalance-symptoms/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. These factors include some medications, alcohol, caffeine, adrenal gland tumors, athletic activity, pregnancy and a variety of health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yurii Yarema/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High cortisol symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excessively high cortisol levels, especially when sustained over time, can be damaging. Chronic high cortisol can also negatively affect metabolic health by promoting insulin resistance and inflammatory processes," said Barardo. In some cases, high cortisol levels could be a sign of Cushing disease, also known as hypercortisolism, a progressive pituitary disease that causes the body to overproduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of high cortisol can vary between individuals. They include weight gain in the face and abdomen, fat buildup under the shoulder blades, purple stretchmarks across the abdomen, decreasing muscle strength, high blood sugar, hypertension, excessive hair growth in women and osteoporosis. &lt;a href="https://drbrighten.com/high-cortisol-and-cognitive-function/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Mental symptoms can include&lt;/a&gt; brain fog, memory issues and irritability. While this captures many of the possible symptoms, it may not contain all of them. In many cases, people will only experience some of these symptoms when they have high cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience symptoms of high cortisol, consider speaking with a medical expert about the risks of high cortisol and Cushing disease. On the other hand, if you have dangerously low cortisol levels, you will want to discuss Addison's disease. Thankfully, you can consult a physician and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/i-got-a-cortisol-blood-stress-test-heres-what-i-learned-and-how-it-affected-my-lifestyle/" target="_self"&gt;test your cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. Ruling out such illnesses, however, may require several tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol tests are often performed using blood samples but can also be done through urinary analysis. Because the urinary analysis test uses a series of inputs over 24 hours, this test may yield more accurate results than blood tests, which often only capture cortisol data from one point in a person's day. As Barardo has said, "This captures cortisol fluctuations throughout the day rather than at one single point in time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best supplements to potentially reduce cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are dietary factors that can increase or decrease cortisol levels, the supplements that aid in this do so indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol itself isn't typically supplemented directly, but certain supplements may help regulate cortisol," Barardo said. "Certain supplements like magnesium, vitamin C, Rhodiola rosea and pterostilbene [the primary antioxidant component of blueberries] are studied for their potential to help regulate cortisol and mitigate the stress response." He said that each of these compounds has the potential to affect cortisol levels through "modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yana Iskayeva/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C may be one of the top potential supplements to reduce cortisol and is readily abundant in several formats. However, how much of this supplement you should take will vary between products. To ensure you're safe, read the product guidelines to ensure you don't exceed the recommended amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38010274/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;study published in 2023&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin C can reduce cortisol levels in some patients with hypercortisolemia. "Vitamin C plays a notable role in cortisol modulation, particularly under stress, through its influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis," Barardo said. "Research demonstrates that vitamin C can reduce excessive cortisol production in response to both psychological and physical stressors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be found naturally in several foods that are commonly available. All citrus fruits have vitamin C within them, but so do potatoes, peppers, strawberries, broccoli and Brussel sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plant is considered an adaptogenic herb, meaning it's believed to help the body manage and reduce stress responses. The US National Institute of Health states within its &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fact sheet on ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; (Withania somnifera) that "several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, most of them fairly small in size and of short duration, have found that ashwagandha may reduce perceived stress and anxiety and improve the quality and duration of sleep." However, because these studies used different ashwagandha preparations and doses, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific recommendation for a specific supplement to reduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's rare to find this plant in everyday recipes, but it can be found as a dietary supplement in several forms ranging from powders to gummies to beverages. How much you should take will vary between these products, so checking the directions before use is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anna Blazhuk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has pursued the idea of omega-3 fatty acids having a reductive effect on cortisol levels. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8510994/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;paper published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who took high levels of omega-3 had lower levels of cortisol when compared to the placebo group. How much of this you can safely eat daily is based on your age, with a &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;recommended intake table&lt;/a&gt; on the National Institute for Health covering each age category. For men over age 14, 1.6 grams daily is recommended, while women over 14 should consume 1.1 grams daily. Those who are pregnant or lactating should consume more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are found in many foods but are especially common in fish, like salmon, mackerel and tuna, and some types of seeds, such as flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts. Omega-3s can also be obtained as a dietary supplement in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rhodiola rosea&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an adaptogen, Rhodiola rosea supports the body's stress response by modulating the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis," Barardo said. "This axis plays a central role in cortisol production, and Rhodiola's effects help balance cortisol levels rather than simply suppress or elevate them, which is characteristic of adaptogens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19016404/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;a 2009 study&lt;/a&gt;, repeated doses of Rhodiola rosea can have "an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, and decreases cortisol response to awakening stress in burnout patients with fatigue syndrome." Exact dosages for this compound will vary between products, but each supplement for lowering cortisol should include recommended intakes on its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Boonchai Wedmakawand/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pterostilbene&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pterostilbene, an antioxidant mainly found in blueberries, has been found to improve stress-related behaviors. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33739881/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; tested pterostilbene treatments on mice, and their findings "suggest that pterostilbene may effectively modulate stress-related abnormal behaviors, neuroinflammation and HPA axis hyperactivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although direct studies on pterostilbene's effect on cortisol are still emerging, early evidence suggests it could support a balanced stress response through neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, which may make it beneficial in chronic stress scenarios," Barardo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol supplements utilizing pterostilbene may be less common but should contain specific recommended intakes for each product if available. As for food sources, aside from blueberries, pterostilbene can be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36234852/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found in grapes and peanuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are these supplements safe and necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While supplements to lower cortisol may be generally safe for most people, they are not the only way to regulate stress. Whether or not these cortisol supplements are necessary will vary between individuals and circumstances; most individuals without cortisol-related illnesses should be okay without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplements that help regulate cortisol are generally safe, but they're not always necessary for everyone," Barardo said. "A healthy lifestyle that includes &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-stress-relieving-tactics-that-will-help-you-reach-your-carefree-era/" target="_self"&gt;stress management practices&lt;/a&gt; can help maintain optimal cortisol levels naturally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help reduce stress levels without needing cortisol supplements, people may be interested in practicing meditation, yoga, pursuing other athletic activities or finding various means of coping with high stress. Research has underscored a variety of mechanisms for reducing stress, with a strong emphasis on what's called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513300/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;mindfulness-based stress reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Although these techniques can be very effective in some cases, not everyone is equally inclined towards mindfulness practices, and learning these techniques without a guide can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering cortisol supplements, it's important to know that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Hence, the requirements for accuracy, transparency and testing are often less than expected. Barardo also points out, "Over-reliance on supplements marketed as cortisol regulators may not address the root causes of stress or high cortisol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Tetra Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about cortisol blockers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol blockers, like mifepristone and pasireotide, are prescription medications &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126229/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;used to treat Cushing's syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. They work by either blocking the uptake of cortisol to receptors or by preventing the release of cortisol in the first place. Beyond this particular class of medication, some people may also refer to supplements and tactics for reducing cortisol levels as blockers, but the difference can be vast. Companies marketing over-the-counter cortisol blockers often rebrand cortisol supplements or other approaches for lowering cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cortisol blocker medications, there can be side effects that your doctor will discuss with you if you're prescribed these medications. These side effects vary between specific cortisol blocker medications. However, these medications are FDA-approved for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cortisol supplements and stress-coping techniques, how safe they are will vary between supplements and techniques. Supplements should have recommended dosages but can be cross-checked against recommended intake levels for specific compounds, like magnesium or vitamin C. However, it is essential to remember that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Always consult with your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to naturally reduce cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to influence and reduce your cortisol levels naturally. How well these approaches work will vary between individuals and instances, with some approaches becoming more effective with practice or time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce cortisol levels, Barardo recommends regular exercise, a balanced diet and engaging in meditation and mindfulness.  "Vitamin C-rich foods and a healthy lifestyle that includes sleep and physical activity are also effective at keeping cortisol levels in check," he added. "Additionally, interacting with loved ones and &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/02/power-pets" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;pets can lower cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and increase serotonin, improving mental health, reducing stress and helping people live longer, healthier lives." Avoiding foods that put excess stress on the body, like caffeine or alcohol, is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human health is often seen as holistic, wherein improving health metrics in one area will also increase health in other areas. Many of these approaches for reducing cortisol involve increasing general areas of health. Pursuing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/stress-less-live-more-7-mental-health-hacks-for-year-round-happiness/" target="_self"&gt;better mental and emotional well-being&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can be linked to better cortisol regulation. The tactics mentioned above fold in several approaches that can help mitigate stress and encourage a reduction in cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may be otherwise healthy, but your body still produces more cortisol than expected. If continuing to pursue natural methods for cortisol regulation doesn't help you, then it might be wise to speak with a medical expert and test your cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is known as the stress hormone because it's released in higher quantities during times of stress and enhances our fight, flight or freeze reactions. When overproduced  and sustained at high levels, this hormone can cause higher stress levels and discomfort and may also contribute to physical symptoms like "cortisol face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various supplements, including vitamin C, ashwagandha, omega-3 fatty acids, Rhodiola rosea and pterostilbene, may help you lower your cortisol levels. However, there are many natural ways, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/5-beginner-breathing-exercises-that-will-help-banish-stress/" target="_self"&gt;mindfulness breathing exercises&lt;/a&gt;, to manage stress and cortisol that may pose less risk of side effects. Some cases of high cortisol could be indications of Cushing's syndrome, in which case medical assistance will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5tYmF0UHk0cmQ1SUNHUGZlX2tRejFQaDMwTjRjVFFaUkNtMjMtY0V5SzNGM0UzRWxUUnh3akVWb2hvd1lXZnB2VTNEUXBCRmZkSG1BTVJYLU9NMUNOWmZZN3otRW1WS3NLY1AtVGJYanh1UQ</guid></item><item><title>An Interview With My Cat About His Most Annoying Behaviors - Defector</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOT1JkOE5NSVFyLVIxek9oUXlsWDVOZjlFeW8zaUJtX1hjMEVoOTRGYy10dTJqQTRvM0ZpRU1EbWp4Qm55anUzX09qcTVnNHZVODhMeWNzdTJsbldJSmRrZHpJQ2ZfVGY2UUFqYnctVFh2eWtOYTZzRXppSzBfWW9IVERaVFN2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="PostContent_content__FblEJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week we're running a small package of essays on the topic of &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://defector.com/tag/nuisances" target="_blank"&gt;nuisances&lt;/a&gt;. Why? That's an annoying question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other member of my generation who has put off traditional markers of adulthood, like home ownership and having children, I am completely, utterly devoted to my cat, Pong. In the five years he’s lived with us, Pong has evolved from the scrawny street cat we adopted in the Union Square Petco to the ruler of our household. We often quote a decade-old Adam Serwer tweet about his own cats: Management doesn’t need a union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve invented a rich mythology for Pong’s inner life over the last five years. His hardscrabble early years taught him to flirt and charm for his meals on the streets of Harlem, where he developed his taste for French fries, noodles, and pizza. He ran with a tough crew that wasn’t afraid to get into scraps if he needed to assert dominance. He inherited his asthma and anxiety from his mother (me), and he spends his days working hard (sleeping on a chair in my office) for the money to pay our rent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any relationship, you fall into rhythms built around each other’s quirks and scar tissue. This is true even—or maybe especially—when the relationship is with an animal who cannot speak English. We’ve come to accept his most annoying behaviors; his loafing on our backs at 5 a.m. like a sleep paralysis demon is just a part of life with Pong, as are the lost hours of sleep and frequent yelling when he can’t find us in the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been curious about meeting with a pet communicator, a type of psychic who can allegedly connect with your pet on the spiritual plane and translate their animal thoughts to English words. Against my better judgment, I am woo woo-curious and have spent hundreds of dollars on supernatural services over the years like aura readings, natal charts, and tarot spreads. Do I believe that animal communicators are 100-percent saying what they claim to do? Not necessarily. But I don't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe in them, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got a recommendation for a pet communicator, whose identity I’m keeping private at their request, and booked a 30-minute session with them. We met on Zoom, and when they started looking for his energy, they asked if he’s a male, six to eight years old, who’s very sure of himself. Pong was sleeping next to me in a little kitty croissant but the communicator couldn't see him on screen. I told them they had the right guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is an interview with Pong, through the communicator, which I’ve edited for clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I’m very tired this morning because you were super active last night, walking around the bed, pawing at our faces, and talking to us. I feel like you do this more often when we’ve recently been traveling. What’s going on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to catch up. You come back from a trip with all these new smells and I want to reconnect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator said here that they were noticing a bit of insecurity too, which Pong wouldn’t say himself.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything I can do to help you with the insecurity you feel when we leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not anything that you're doing wrong  It's more just like when somebody leaves and you miss them. It doesn't matter if they say, “I'll come back and I'll bring you a souvenir or something.” You're still going to miss them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, that makes sense. I do wish you'd let us sleep through the night, though. Something else I wanted to bring up: It seems like you really don’t like it when either of us goes into the bathroom. You stand outside the door and cry, and stick your paw under the door in the most desperate way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you keeping me out? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, it’s basically like a human litter box, and we want to have some private time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No need to keep me out, though. I’m not worried about you in there, but I just want you to remember I’m here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator noted again that they were picking up on insecurity, like a mild separation anxiety, which was interesting because the first thing they noticed about Pong was his confidence. Maybe a bit of bravado?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there something you’d like to do in the bathroom together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sounds of the water are interesting. We could go at that together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean play with the water? You do seem pretty curious about the shower and bathtub. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to bathe in it, but I’m curious about how the water moves. It’s like a science experiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator recommended I look into water enrichment toys for cats.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me anything about your life before you came to live with us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t a loving family, but there were two or three people who took care of me on the street. There was one man who I had a strong relationship with. There was a misunderstanding, the people tried to bring me into the house, and then took me away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This made me think of Alex, the doorman who apparently fed him when he was a stray, and who he was named for when he was brought to Union Square. Yes, we should’ve kept that name.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sorry that happened, but I hope you’re happy now that you’ve been with us! One thing I’ve noticed about you is that you don’t really have much of a hunting instinct. If there is ever a bug in the house, you might watch it or bat at it, but you won’t stalk and kill it. We’re going to be moving pretty soon, and there’s a good chance that we’re moving somewhere that will have a mouse problem. Do you think you could help us with that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh … what am I supposed to do with a mouse? Do I eat it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t think we’d want you to eat it. You could maybe bring it to us, but that’s kind of gross. I guess ideally I’d want you to just scare them away so they aren’t a problem. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you don’t want me to be friends with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, that would probably not be ideal.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hm … all right. I’m not really sure what to expect, but  I'm just going to do my thing and just chill, maybe they'll get the hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I appreciate that. OK, one last question. Sometimes you’ll crawl up onto my lap and be really sweet and snuggly, and then out of nowhere you’ll start attacking me, biting me and breaking skin. It really sucks when that happens! What’s going on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like I’m back on the street and it just happens. It feels right in the moment, but when you get upset I feel ashamed. I saw the tissues with the blood last week and I feel bad. It’s not your fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks. Last week was rough and my fingers are still healing from it! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator told him that when he starts to feel emotional like that, the best thing he can do is to walk away.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, I can work on that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you. I love you! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Call ended.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Defector</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOT1JkOE5NSVFyLVIxek9oUXlsWDVOZjlFeW8zaUJtX1hjMEVoOTRGYy10dTJqQTRvM0ZpRU1EbWp4Qm55anUzX09qcTVnNHZVODhMeWNzdTJsbldJSmRrZHpJQ2ZfVGY2UUFqYnctVFh2eWtOYTZzRXppSzBfWW9IVERaVFN2dw</guid></item><item><title>First measles death is reported in the West Texas outbreak that's infected more than 120 people - The Associated Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNRDRQY2txVGs2NVduNEQ0RG5yVEhxQ1hmZ1JwaE45T0ZTcXBiMG1MWmxYXzhFbWtNVGVoRlhoVnlJX0lBUFpjeHowblVVWlU0clppQkZ5VGtvTkVRMWpZbHpLUTV0ZVBUTGdmMWs0YzdublB4ZHljcnJzYkdUMzcyWlJINDk3SXNNd2VlaUFacTNNd3llbFE0dUxRTHNpdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Associated Press</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNRDRQY2txVGs2NVduNEQ0RG5yVEhxQ1hmZ1JwaE45T0ZTcXBiMG1MWmxYXzhFbWtNVGVoRlhoVnlJX0lBUFpjeHowblVVWlU0clppQkZ5VGtvTkVRMWpZbHpLUTV0ZVBUTGdmMWs0YzdublB4ZHljcnJzYkdUMzcyWlJINDk3SXNNd2VlaUFacTNNd3llbFE0dUxRTHNpdw</guid></item><item><title>Belly fat can boost brain health?

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; belly fat may be beneficial for brain health in younger individuals due to its role in maintaining healthy BDNF.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging disrupts this benefit&lt;/strong&gt; because of decreased production of a key protein, CX3CL1. This leads to lower BDNF levels and potentially contributes to cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive fat accumulation&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in obesity, is associated with overexpression of 11β-HSD1, which is linked to negative metabolic effects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOKYO —&lt;/strong&gt; Age-related cognitive decline sneaks up on millions of people worldwide. It begins with those frustrating “senior moments” in middle age and can progress to more serious memory and thinking problems later in life. While scientists have traditionally focused their attention directly on the brain to understand these changes, new research out of Toho University in Japan points to an unexpected contributor: your belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01546-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GeroScience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that visceral fat—the deep fat surrounding your internal organs—plays a role in maintaining brain health through a chemical messaging system. You might have heard of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)—think of it as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-brain-supplements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;. It helps brain cells grow, survive, and form new connections. The more BDNF you have, the better your brain functions. But as you age, your BDNF levels naturally drop, and that’s when memory problems can start.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s where &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; comes in. This new study found that CX3CL1, a protein made by visceral fat, plays a big role in maintaining healthy BDNF levels. In younger mice, their belly fat produced plenty of CX3CL1, keeping their brain function strong. But as the mice aged, both their belly fat and their brain’s BDNF levels took a nosedive. When scientists artificially lowered CX3CL1 in young mice, their BDNF levels dropped too, mimicking the effects of aging. But when they gave older mice an extra dose of CX3CL1, their brain’s BDNF bounced back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings flip conventional wisdom about belly fat on its head. While excess visceral fat is still harmful and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/belly-fat-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked to many health problems&lt;/a&gt;, this research suggests that healthy amounts of visceral fat early on serve an important purpose by producing signaling molecules that support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The research tracked male mice at different ages—5, 10, and 18 months old (roughly equivalent to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/young-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;young adult&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/middle-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;middle-aged&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;elderly humans&lt;/a&gt;). The 5-month-old and 10-month-old mice had similar levels of BDNF in their hippocampus, but by 18 months, these levels had dropped by about a third. This pattern matches the typical trajectory of cognitive aging, where significant decline often doesn’t begin until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, CX3CL1 production in visceral fat remained stable in younger mice but declined significantly in older animals, supporting a link between the two proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

But they stress that too much, of course, is harmful to health — especially for an aging brain.(© suriya  – stock.adobe.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-hormones-and-the-fat-brain-connection"&gt;Stress Hormones and the Fat-Brain Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To dig deeper, the researchers asked: What causes the drop in fat-derived CX3CL1 in the first place? The answer involved stress hormones like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cortisol/"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; (in humans) and corticosterone (in mice). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Glucocorticoids boost CX3CL1 production. An enzyme in belly fat called 11β-HSD1 reactivates inactive forms of glucocorticoids and keeps them active in cells, promoting glucocorticoid-dependent expression of CX3CL1,” study co-author Dr. Yoshinori Takei tells StudyFinds. “11β-HSD1 is essential for belly fat to respond to circulating glucocorticoids properly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as we age, the amount of this enzyme declines, leading to lower CX3CL1 and BDNF levels. When 11β-HSD1 decreases with age, this entire system weakens, potentially contributing to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/memory-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper notes that while lower 11β-HSD1 in aging is problematic for CX3CL1 production and brain health, excessive 11β-HSD1 expression is linked to obesity-related diseases. High 11β-HSD1 levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a known risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-belly-fat"&gt;Rethinking Belly Fat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection between belly fat and brain health highlights how intertwined our body systems really are. Our brains don’t operate in isolation but depend on signals from throughout the body—including, surprisingly, our &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/body-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fat tissue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you start thinking about packing on belly fat for the sake of your brain, don’t! The researchers stress that balance is key. Too little belly fat and you lose the brain-protecting effects, but too much can cause &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/belly-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best way to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maintain brain health&lt;/a&gt; as you age is to focus on proven strategies: staying active, eating a balanced diet, managing stress, and keeping your mind engaged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this research is still in its early stages and was conducted in mice, it opens up fascinating possibilities for understanding how our bodies and brains are connected. Scientists may one day find ways to tap into this fat-brain communication system to slow cognitive decline and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/friendships-old-age-memory-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;keep our minds sharper&lt;/a&gt; for longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next time you pinch an inch around your middle, remember: there’s a conversation happening between your belly and your brain that science is just beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How the Study Worked&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used male mice of three different ages: 5 months (young adult), 10 months (middle-aged), and 18 months (elderly). They measured BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus using a test called ELISA that can detect specific proteins in tissue samples. They also measured CX3CL1 levels in visceral fat tissue using two methods: one that detects the RNA instructions for making the protein and another that detects the protein itself. To determine whether fat-derived CX3CL1 directly affects brain BDNF, they used a technique called RNA interference to reduce CX3CL1 production specifically in the belly fat of younger mice, then checked what happened to brain BDNF levels. They also injected CX3CL1 into older mice to see if it would restore their brain BDNF levels. To understand what regulates CX3CL1 production, they treated fat cells grown in the lab with different stress hormones. Finally, they measured levels and activity of the enzyme 11β-HSD1 in fat tissue from younger and older mice, and used RNA interference to reduce this enzyme in younger mice to see how it affected the fat-brain signaling system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study uncovered several key findings. First, hippocampal BDNF levels were similar in 5-month-old and 10-month-old mice (about 300 pg BDNF/mg protein) but dropped by about one-third in 18-month-old mice (about 200 pg BDNF/mg protein). CX3CL1 levels in visceral fat showed a similar pattern, decreasing significantly in the oldest mice. When the researchers reduced CX3CL1 production in the belly fat of younger mice, their brain BDNF levels fell within days, similar to levels seen in naturally aged mice. On the flip side, a single injection of CX3CL1 into the abdominal cavity of older mice boosted their brain BDNF back up, confirming the connection between these proteins. The researchers also found that natural stress hormones (corticosterone in mice, cortisol in humans) increased CX3CL1 production in fat cells, while the enzyme 11β-HSD1 that activates these hormones was much less abundant in the fat tissue of older mice. When they reduced this enzyme in younger mice, both fat CX3CL1 and brain BDNF levels decreased, revealing another link in the signaling chain. Together, these results mapped out a communication pathway from belly fat to brain that becomes disrupted with age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study presents intriguing findings, several limitations should be kept in mind. The research used only male mice to avoid complications from female hormonal cycles, so we don’t know if the same patterns exist in females. The sample sizes were small, with most tests using just three mice per group. While this is common in basic science research, larger studies would strengthen confidence in the results. The researchers demonstrated connections between fat tissue signals and brain BDNF levels but didn’t directly test whether these changes affected the mice’s memory or cognitive abilities, though their previous work had shown that CX3CL1 injections improved recognition memory in aged mice. The study was also limited to specific ages in mice, and we don’t yet know how these findings might translate to humans across our much longer lifespan. Finally, the researchers used artificial RNA interference techniques to reduce CX3CL1 and enzyme levels for short periods—different from the gradual changes that occur during natural aging—which might affect how the results apply to real-world aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion and Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research reveals a previously unknown communication system between belly fat and the brain. Under normal conditions, stress hormones in the blood are activated by the enzyme 11β-HSD1 in visceral fat, which then produces CX3CL1. This fat-derived CX3CL1 signals through immune cells and the vagus nerve (a major nerve connecting internal organs to the brain) to maintain healthy BDNF levels in the hippocampus. As we age, reduced 11β-HSD1 in belly fat disrupts this signaling chain, contributing to lower brain BDNF and potentially to age-related memory problems. This discovery changes how we think about visceral fat, suggesting that while excess belly fat is harmful, healthy amounts serve important functions in supporting brain health. The findings also hint at future therapeutic possibilities—perhaps treatments could target components of this pathway to maintain brain function in aging. The researchers note that a careful balance is needed, as both too little 11β-HSD1 (associated with cognitive decline) and too much (linked to obesity and metabolic problems) appear harmful. For the average person concerned about brain health, this research underscores that the body works as an interconnected whole, with tissues we don’t typically associate with thinking—like fat—playing important roles in maintaining our cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
