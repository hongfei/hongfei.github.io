The paper says independent review bodies have suggested a near 4% increase for teachers, and just under 3% for NHS staff - more than ministers had budgeted for. The government is expected to accept the proposals, according to the paper, but the report notes it still faces the prospect of industrial action. One NHS source is quoted as saying the offer "will go down really badly".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sir Keir Starmer will announce plans to tighten legal migration laws, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/27/starmer-plans-migrant-cuts-to-fight-reform/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.

A few years ago, hardly anyone talked about chia seeds outside of hardcore health circles. Now, they’re popping up everywhere—from your favorite smoothie bowls to overnight puddings blowing up on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have quietly transformed from a niche health food to a mainstream superfood sensation. With fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, these small black and white seeds are now a pantry staple in health-aware kitchens globally. Their popularity stems from an increasing interest in plant-based diets and easy, natural nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts also back chia seeds for their potential to support heart health, digestive health, weight management, and even blood sugar control. In a world increasingly focused on wellness, convenience, and clean eating, chia seeds tick all the right boxes. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a busy professional, or just someone trying to eat a little healthier, it’s easy to see why chia seeds are becoming a pantry staple everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;However, there's a caveat!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US doctor, Dr. Joseph Salhab, who is popularly known as 'thestomachdoc' and 'Dr GI Joe' on social media has a warning for those who regularly consume chia seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says eating chia seeds directly can land you in hospital. Sharing an incident where a man, with prior swallowing issues, ate chia seeds and had to undergo surgery to get it removed after it got stuck in its food pipe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaking chia seeds isn’t just some fancy health hack—it’s actually really important if you want to get the most out of them. When you soak chia seeds, they absorb a ton of water and form a gel-like coating. This makes them way easier for your body to digest and helps unlock all the good stuff inside, like fiber, protein, and omega-3s. If you eat dry chia seeds without soaking them first, they can pull water from your body while they’re expanding, which might cause bloating or even make you feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaked chia seeds are much gentler on your stomach. They help keep things moving smoothly in your digestive system, which is a big win if you're aiming for better gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big bonus of soaking chia seeds is that it actually makes their nutrients much more available to your body. You know, chia seeds contain an outer fiber layer that's great, but it also behaves like a tiny shield, so it makes it more difficult for your body to digest them properly when they're dry. When you soak them, the seeds soften and this tends to unlock valuable nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids, so that your body is able to use and absorb them better. If you don't soak them, much of those good nutrients will simply go through your system without being properly digested. Soaking isn’t just about avoiding tummy troubles—it’s about making sure you get the full power of what chia seeds have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a practical point of view, soaked chia seeds also have a fun, pudding-like texture that’s perfect for smoothies, oatmeal, and desserts. So next time you’re about to toss a handful of chia into your meal, take a few extra minutes to soak them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to plate your meal, as per Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut by Dr. Ishi Khosla&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>40多岁的女性需要以不同的方式进食，我保证这不仅仅是为了让她们看起来更年轻- BuzzFeed | Women In Their 40s Need To Eat Differently, And I Promise It's Not Just To Make Them Look Younger - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5JZXZjU3M2Q1JfRWYzUE5vQng0LW9KQ3hsSnJ2YTJZaTEyNmlPVHBacXNzZXN5MTBBZEEtdzM5N0ZSYlZ1ZjI0elJkVlFzb3JqMUFVZ2htRERVVHNWenNmZzRwNjQzZ0VBTFZJUEpRcVVmZUJWVWJBQm5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a woman who’s in her mid-40s, you’ve probably witnessed a number of fad diets and nutritional holy grails over the past few decades. Now that you’re (just a little bit) older and wiser, you’ve likely settled into a pattern of eating that works for you and makes you feel energized and nourished at least most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you may have noticed a few changes to your body in the past few years. “For most women, perimenopausal symptoms might have been happening since your mid-30s,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-stephanie-s-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20199366" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Stephanie Faubion&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of The North American Menopause Society and director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health. “The typical age to begin menopause is 45.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are changes ahead, no doubt, but you can help yourself ease into this next phase of life by making some smart nutritional choices to help yourself age as gracefully as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may already have been noticing weight gain, or a redistribution of weight, with more settling around your belly area, Faubion noted. “We lose muscle mass by 1% a year after age 50, and most adults gain about a pound and a half each year progressively through middle age,” Faubion said. But she said weight gain, while challenging, isn’t inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t exercise it all off, so you need to pay attention to what you’re eating,” she said. “You don’t have to deprive yourself, though, and you can have a beautiful, healthy diet that’s filled with fruits and vegetables.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s your "window of opportunity" to eat more nitrate-rich veggies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/midlife.strong" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826"&gt;Maryann Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; is a registered dietitian and midlife health expert who noted that “many women over age 45 are at an increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, even when they eat the way they always have.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this might be the best possible moment to switch things around on your plate. “Health experts call the time of life a ‘window of opportunity,’” she said. “That’s because the decisions we make at midlife will affect our health in our older years.” It’s a good time to up your intake of nitrate-rich vegetables such as leafy greens, celery, and beets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These help women increase their nitric oxide levels that decline with both aging and hormonal changes,” Jacobsen said. “In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954341/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826" data-affiliate="true"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; showed that two salads a day helped increase nitric oxide-related blood flow in midlife women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also suggested a renewed focus on micronutrients, including magnesium, zinc, choline, omega-3s, iodine, B vitamins and selenium. “Aging and lower estrogen levels affect how much of those micronutrients the body absorbs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Cabbage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-cabbage/" target="_self"&gt;nutrient-dense vegetable&lt;/a&gt; is low in both potassium and sodium while packing in fiber, vitamins C and K and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/omega-3s-may-offer-heart-and-hearing-benefits/" target="_self"&gt;Omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/content/7-kidney-friendly-superfoods" target="_self"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/fish" target="_self"&gt;a chart you can use&lt;/a&gt; to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jacobs Stock Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cabbage, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/bell-peppers" target="_self"&gt;bell peppers&lt;/a&gt; pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Cranberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cranberries &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/keephealthy/newsletter/FallWinter2013/KH_Cranberry-Kidney-Connection" target="_self"&gt;help to prevent&lt;/a&gt; urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-cranberries/" target="_self"&gt;cranberries&lt;/a&gt; have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Blueberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/what_foods_help_repair_kidneys/article.htm" target="_self"&gt;foods help repair kidneys&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-blueberries/" target="_self"&gt;Blueberries&lt;/a&gt; deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With high levels of antioxidants and loads of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/why-you-need-vitamin-c-for-immune-support-and-how-to-get-enough/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Dark, leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables#:~:text=Dark%20green%20leafy%20vegetables%20are,many%20of%20the%20B%2Dvitamins." target="_self"&gt;key vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;, plus immunity-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy" target="_self"&gt;A study from Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618629/" target="_self"&gt;people with CKD&lt;/a&gt;, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the same family as garlic, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-onions" target="_self"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt; give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Cauliflower&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282844" target="_self"&gt;Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Egg whites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/core-kidney/patient-resources/eating-healthy" target="_self"&gt;Egg whites&lt;/a&gt; are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Arugula&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-arugula" target="_self"&gt;Arugula&lt;/a&gt; is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNMW9zZ1cxX0QtVjk0Y056TEp4SkhfMWM5aWN2aVNHdzdDWnI0dnVLSXJYZWhzN2h0ZDVuUjZwSXhVc09wVkZJTUZFbjVSQ2IzSU5VN2ZNS0JSOHpUOFZsWUlJTUNTMGtJVlFLRmsxcmZlTFdrNVFJemJsNFd2NC1RUXY1Smo4Y0FDUFNLdFJzRVl0UTFYWkVxYmVNZw</guid></item><item><title>随着加州酒店工作人员死于与杀害Gene Hackman妻子相同的罕见啮齿动物疾病，人们越来越担心-每日邮报 | Growing concern as California hotel worker dies from same rare rodent disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An employee of a well-known &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-bb2063d0-2385-11f0-88d7-fb69090cb07d"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rodrigo Becerra, 26, who worked as a bell hop at the Mammoth Mountain Inn, was found dead in his employee-allocated home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome on March 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gene Hackman's (right) wife Betsy Arakawa (left) died from the same rodent-caused virus just a few days before the Oscar winner died from complications of pre-existing health conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hantavirus is considered an extremely rare and deadly disease spread by rodents' urine, droppings and salvia (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it is unclear how Becerra caught the fatal virus, Becerra was likely exposed to it at work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The director of health and safety for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, David Andrews, told SFGate: 'A very small amount of rodent droppings were found in the bell area and behind the front desk, very near the front entrance at Mammoth Mountain Inn (MMI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The trace amounts found weren’t concerning to health officials...We don’t have reason for concern about workplace exposure at MMI for our employees or guests.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mono County is the fourth-smallest county in California and is home to just over 13,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three residents who have died from hantavirus this year were employed at workplaces that had evidence of rodents, Mono County Health spokesperson Justin Caporusso told SFGate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Note that investigators found evidence of the presence of mice in the workplaces of each of these three people, but in no case did they find a gross infestation, a situation that would pose an obvious health risk,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrews defended the resort, asserting they have had a 'comprehensive hantavirus policy in place for years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also told the outlet the resort has hired a company to deep-clean areas 'that have seen rodent activity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A spokesperson for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area (pictured) said investigators found no evidence of Becerra's work conditions putting him at risk &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Becerra (pictured with Mariela) was just a few days away from his 27th birthday when he died &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his early-April statement, Boo explained: 'We observed some mice in [Becerra's] workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We haven't identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person's exposure to mice or their droppings.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela said her family feels no resentment towards the Mammoth, as her brother thoroughly enjoyed being a part of its community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the resort hosted a celebration of life to honor the passing of their devoted employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mammoth was always such a special place to him,' his sister wrote in a &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/remembering-rigo-a-life-full-of-adventure"&gt;GoFundMe &lt;/a&gt;tribute, which has raised more than $17,400.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This ski season he is sitting at the top of the Mammoth leaderboard with 96 days of skiing on the mountain he loved most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was so excited to get to 100 days by his birthday.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When’s the last time you pooped? Earlier today? Earlier this week? Earlier this decade? If you find yourself pooping no more than once a week and do not happen to be a sloth, you may want to see a doctor. That’s because such infrequent pooping may be setting yourself up for some medical problems down the road, &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" aria-label="according to a study published in Cell Reports Medicine"&gt;according to a study published in &lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, pooping too often—like every 10 minutes—is not good either. The study suggested that the best potty line, so to speak, is pooping once to twice a day because that frequency was associated with lab test results that in turn are associated with better long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Study Looked At Poop Habits And Lab Test Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the poop on the study. It was an analysis of various types of clinical and laboratory data and questionnaire responses from over 1,400 seemingly healthy adults. The study was conducted by research team from the Institute of System Biology in Seattle, Washington (Johannes P. Johnson-Martínez, Christian Diener, Anne E. Levine, Tomasz Wilmanski, Alexandra Ralevski, Jennifer Hadlock, Andrew T. Magis, Leroy Hood, Noa Rappaport and Sean M. Gibbons) and Seattle Children’s Hospital (David L. Suskind). It included measuring the bloodstream levels of various metabolites and toxins with long names like 3-indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate, p-cresol glucuronide and phenylacetylglutamine. They also checked the stool of volunteers for different things such as measures of microbiome activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team then looked at how these measurements correlated with answers that the study participants provided on the questionnaires. This included a question on how often they pooped with the answers falling into one of the following four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constipation: &lt;/em&gt;This corresponded to pooping no more than once or twice in a a week, which is considered lower than normal for a human but not for a sloth.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low-normal:&lt;/em&gt; This was less than a daily bowel movement, ranging from three to six times per week.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-normal:&lt;/em&gt; This was pooping once to three times per day.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diarrhea: &lt;/em&gt;Anyone who has ever had diarrhea should at least loosely know what this means. If you’ve never had diarrhea in the past, you are in for a treat when it happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When You Poop Too Infrequently, Toxins Can Build Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team found that volunteers who had lower frequencies of pooping also tended to have higher levels of different toxins in their bloodstreams. Elevated levels of such toxins is associated with higher levels of inflammation and damage to the heart, liver and kidneys. In fact, the study found an association between less frequent bowel movements and lower kidney function with elevated levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate potentially playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is a reminder of why we all poop. It’s not simply to “get away from it all” or to provide extra alone time to doomscroll or text on your smartphone. Pooping is one form of excretion, a way your body can get rid of waste from your body. Not pooping frequently enough can be akin to not taking out the trash nearly often enough. Bad stuff can accumulate and potentially cause problems. When you are constipated, you are basically turning your body into something like your freshman year in college dorm room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stool in your gut can be a bit like those houseguests that you don’t really want hanging around too long. At the first, the interactions between that stuff and your microbiome— &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/06/25/can-this-bacteria-in-your-gut-improve-your-running/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/06/25/can-this-bacteria-in-your-gut-improve-your-running/" target="_self" aria-label="the city of microbes in your intestines"&gt;the city of microbes in your intestines&lt;/a&gt;— can be positive. Those microbes ferment the available fiber into short-chain fatty acids, which are good for your body. But when the poop keeps hanging around, things turn city, so to speak. The microbes start breaking down the available proteins into toxins. This can happen even in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When You Poop Too Frequently, You Can Lose Nutrients And Fluid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number two thing to look out for, though, is pooping too often, as in diarrhea often. With diarrhea, you aren’t absorbing enough of the nutrients from the food that you consumed and losing fluid and electrolytes through the loose stools. In the short term, this can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances that when severe enough can even lead to life-threatening situations. Over the longer-term, such losses can result in significant nutritional deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising then that the study found not-so-great lab values among those experiencing diarrhea. There were perturbations in levels of omega-6 fatty acid, homocysteine, total protein, bilirubin and a host of other things. This is why you shouldn’t ever say, “It’s the end of solid stools as I know it, and I feel fine.” A balance in between too few and too often is needed. And according to this study, that balance may be in the one to two times a day range.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The Concept Of Precision Poop Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean that you should freak out if you go a day or two without pooping every now and then. Or if you happen to a have four-or-five-trips-to-the-porcelain-throne day. The study asked about average pooping frequencies and relied on self-report. It’s difficult to tell how accurate people may have been in recalling their poops. The research team did not follow each of the study participants around all day, making note of when they pooped. That could have been a bit weird and prohibitively expensive to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that one size rarely fits all, even when it comes to poop. Let’s rephrase that. While this study’s results can provide general ballparks to aim for, they may not be specifically applicable to everyone. Your body size, age, metabolism, diet, physical activity level and other things may contribute to what’s the best specific pooping schedule for you. Therefore, just like &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/08/15/what-is-precision-nutrition-how-it-can-transform-your-diet-and-health/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/08/15/what-is-precision-nutrition-how-it-can-transform-your-diet-and-health/" target="_self" aria-label="how precision nutrition"&gt;how precision nutrition&lt;/a&gt; aims to better tailor diets and nutrition recommendations to different people’s characteristics and circumstances, one should be more tailored and precise about what to expect in pooping, whether you are talking about the content or frequency of poop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the end, it is a good idea to pay attention to your poop and how often you see it. Your poop and pooping are important measures of your health. So, if you are finding yourself pooping no more than once or twice a week or multiple times each day, you may want to see your doctor to get to the bottom of what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For all their education, medical practitioners sometimes forget that what’s old hat to them is new territory for their patients. [David Revoy] learned that when a recent visit to the veterinarian resulted in the need to monitor his cat’s pulse rate at home, a task that he found difficult enough that he hacked together &lt;a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com/article1075/diy-digital-stethoscope-for-cats" target="_blank"&gt;this digital cat stethoscope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never fear; [David] makes it clear that his fur-baby [Geuloush] is fine, although the gel needed for an echocardiogram likely left the cat permanently miffed. With a normal feline heart rate in the 140s, [David] found it hard to get an accurate pulse by palpation, so he bought a cheap stethoscope and a basic lavalier USB microphone. Getting them together was as easy as cutting the silicone tubing from the stethoscope head and sticking the microphone into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tricky part, of course, would be getting [Geuloush] to cooperate. That took some doing, but soon enough [David] had a clean recording to visualize in an audio editor. From there it’s just a simple matter of counting up the peaks and figuring out the beats per second. It probably wouldn’t be too hard to build a small counter using a microcontroller so he doesn’t have to count on the cat napping near his PC, but in our experience, keyboards are pretty good cat attractants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those nice, quick hacks whose simplicity belies their impact. It’s certainly not as fancy as some of &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/02/25/stethoscopes-electronics-and-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;the smart stethoscopes we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn’t need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to [Spooner] for the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

But the cures often come with severe effects on quality of life. That can include removal of the stomach or bladder, a permanent colostomy bag, radiation that makes patients infertile and lasting damage from chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So a research group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, using a drug from the pharmaceutical company GSK, tried something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers started with a group of 103 people. The trial participants were among the 2 to 3 percent of cancer patients with tumors that should respond to immunotherapy, a drug that overcomes barriers that prevent the immune system from attacking cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in clinical trials, immunotherapy is not supposed to replace the standard treatments. The researchers, led by Dr. Luis A.

It was August 2022. The tumor, she said, blocked off a portion of her esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, making it difficult to swallow food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The standard treatment approach for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-often-better-less-intensive-treatment-study-shows-rcna155158" target="_blank"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; — chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery to remove part of the esophagus and stomach  — “is quite devastating,” said Dr. Luis Diaz, the head of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “One can overcome that, and there’s a new normal after that, but it’s not like what it was before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Going through all of those treatments, Sideris said, “would have been horrendous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, she received just one treatment — &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering.

The Phase 2 trial focused on people whose tumors had what’s known as mismatch repair deficiency, a mutation that means mistakes in the DNA aren’t fixed when cancer cells replicate. This leads to even more mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the treatment to work, “the tumors need to have this mutation,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek of Memorial Sloan Kettering. Cercek led the clinical trial and presented the findings at the &lt;a href="https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2025/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21152382950&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADrBdMT_RFsPg0d8_6DW1lRKXNZdn&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwqfABhBcEiwAZJjC3p8iqS1RGj8bumvKzKrO5ALMys4qwvrswsSucJZ3DDWPTIT3dMRURhoCvVIQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"&gt;American Association for Cancer Research’s&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting on Sunday in Chicago.

About 16% of ovarian cancers and as much as 30% of endometrial cancers have the mutation, compared to 10%-20% of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804922004464#:~:text=Microsatellite%20unstable%20(MSI)%20colorectal%20cancers,MMR%20system%20(Lynch%20syndrome)." target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;.

The drugs have been found to work particularly well against tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies, because the many mutations provide more targets for immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the drugs typically aren’t used as a first-line treatment for these cancers. Instead, they’re brought in if approaches like chemotherapy and radiation don’t work, or if a cancer returns or has already spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial expanded on a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201445" target="_blank"&gt;smaller study&lt;/a&gt; from Cercek that used the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab as the first treatment in 12 people with rectal cancers that were advanced but had not spread elsewhere in the body. All of the people’s tumors had mismatch repair deficiencies. Everyone underwent immunotherapy treatment for at least six months. At the end of that time, all 12 had a complete response, meaning there was no evidence of the tumor remaining. None of them had to undergo other cancer treatments that would usually be used to treat these types of cancer, including surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers started with rectal cancers because the treatments, and in particular the surgery, can be life-changing. Surgery may involve removing the rectum — the final portion of the large intestine before the anus. Patients who undergo this surgery must have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-describe-signs-ignored-rcna129838" target="_blank"&gt;a colostomy&lt;/a&gt;, an operation where the intestine is rerouted to a hole made in the abdomen for stool to pass out of the body into what’s known as an ostomy bag. “This will have a significant impact on your quality of life,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The second part of the trial expanded the treatment to more people, including patients with other cancers known to have mismatch repair deficiencies, including cancers of the esophagus; endometrium; kidney and ureters; and liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Everyone enrolled in the trial had early-stage cancer, meaning it hadn’t spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris was one of the first people with a noncolorectal cancer to be cleared for the treatment in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During her first appointment, Sideris was hooked up to an IV that dripped the immunotherapy into her bloodstream. “Within 45 minutes, it’s done,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris repeated the process every three weeks over the next six months as Cercek and her team enrolled other people who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. They were divided into two categories: those with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-dna-damage-gut-toxin-antibiotics-rcna202572" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and those with the other types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The first group, rectal cancers, included 49 patients who completed six months of immunotherapy. All of them responded to the therapy and didn’t need surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. About 75% of them were still cancer-free a year or more after completing the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the second group, 54 people completed the six-month treatment, and 35 — about 61% — had complete responses and didn’t need to undergo further treatment. The researchers didn't look at data on the patients’ 12-month results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris said she’s grateful she didn’t have to endure the side effects of chemotherapy, but the immunotherapy did cause kidney failure, a known side effect of the drug. She’s now taking medication to manage the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, Sideris said, “it was like winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, cautioned that mismatch repair deficiencies only account for “1%-2% of cancers at most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Unfortunately, this is not going to be something that is a cure-all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But for people who do have this type of cancer, the findings offer substantial hope: Cancer surgery can often be “life-altering,” Kamath said. “A huge number might not need surgery at all and can be cured from the immunotherapy alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diaz said that for patients with mismatch repair deficiency, it may be possible to avoid 80% of surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Being able to preserve people’s organs by avoiding surgery can have a huge effect on quality of life. Depending on the surgery, patients could experience sexual dysfunction, loss of bowel control, acid reflux and infertility. Chemotherapy and radiation can also hurt fertility. This is particularly important at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-gen-x-millennials-17-types-reverse-trend-rcna164376" target="_blank"&gt;more young people are being diagnosed with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, Cercek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The research also suggests that immunotherapy could possibly be used as a first-line treatment for early-stage mismatch repair deficient cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Immune therapies have a ton of potential. This shows we might be able to start with that,” said Dr. Heather Yeo, a surgical oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diaz said that while larger studies are needed to confirm the trial’s findings, using immunotherapy in place of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy may not be far off for certain patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I think it’s a short step from this report to application of standard of care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNZXkwTTczZ1VGWmZIUVBoNU5CWmJjd1A3TV9lSjNWelNKOV9GdUg0SXJMUVI3SGNsNkpIc0xsZG0ySXJpdVFFTnJwVm5UODlXNVNBMk42blMybHo0OVFHWmZkVGxlSFg4bXlVLXNaOWtSaFRvZVNaMVE4YWc1UDhqNGhxLVR3WUwwdFVKTVluZjlUMFlsWXVHbndGOThKYVF5VjhVa2x1NG3SAVZBVV95cUxQLWZ3Q0M0NmZlTnBidzlkRGt5eW9telphb2hOZGRhb2s3aFRXd0NGY0E2cm1HOWduSmdQTHFGZk53OTR2Sk85N2F1ODhVdk41czY1ZmJwUQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您应该吃6种“坏”食物来降低中风风险- EatingWell | 6 "Bad" Foods You Should Be Eating to Decrease Your Stroke Risk, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBwZDFVb1Itd0hNYURBRmJFdEpXNGgwVFY1M3Z5bGtscVFaLVltX3ZENjNSUG1lcWNzZ19MQkpKUVRsU1N6THA3c2xPQ0V5UV9QWUQ5aWpTNzItdkM5d3g0aXdRclhyeEcwY2J1Y3h5dU54NEw5NkJROVluTWlsWXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Navigating the endless advice on what to eat for better brain and blood vessel health can leave you feeling dizzy. One day, you’re reading that a specific food contains compounds that can increase your stroke risk, and the next, you’re told that it’s actually packed with beneficial nutrients. This constant back-and-forth is not only exhausting, but it also leaves you feeling confused about what truly belongs on your plate. We asked dietitians to break down the science and share the top six misunderstood foods that may lower your chances of having a stroke.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; are often tossed aside for their high calorie content. But crack open the truth, and you’ll find those calories come from healthy fats that support your heart and may reduce stroke risk. “The unsaturated fats in nuts are actually very good for cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.meghanpendleton.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Meghan Pendleton Nutrition, a private practice based in Metro Detroit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that munching on nuts at least five times a week may help reduce stroke risk by 19%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But that’s not all. Pendleton shares that nuts are also rich in antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation. “Inflammation is a key process in atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which can lead to stroke,” she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To incorporate more nuts into your diet, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881665/everything-seasoned-almonds/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Everything-Seasoned Almonds&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to their higher sugar content, biting into a banana is often put on the “don’t” list when it comes to weight loss and overall health. However, this sweet fruit &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009266/benefits-of-bananas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brings much more to the table&lt;/a&gt; than carbohydrates. “They’re actually a great source of potassium, a mineral that can help lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theheartdietitian.com/the-heart-dietitian-meet-veronica-rouse/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Heart Dietitian. “Since high blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for stroke, getting enough potassium each day is an important step in reducing your risk,” she emphasizes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fall short&lt;/a&gt; of the recommended intake of 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, you can easily boost your intake by adding banana slices to a parfait or tossing frozen bananas into the blender for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251254/almond-butter-banana-protein-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;creamy smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many, coffee is a daily pick-me-up, but its impact on stroke risk often brews debate. “Good news: You don’t need to give up your morning coffee. While caffeine can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, it doesn’t appear to contribute to sustained high blood pressure over time. In fact, moderate [filtered] coffee consumption (2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to a lower risk of stroke in long-term studies,” says Rouse.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its caffeine content, this beloved beverage is also brimming with antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, that contribute to its stroke-protective properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But there’s a catch: Rouse warns that higher intake could increase stroke risk, so it’s best to cap your cup of joe habit at no more than 3 cups a day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long regarded as an artery-friendly grain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; has faced some undeserved skepticism for its impact on blood sugar. “Some people are afraid to eat oatmeal due to concerns about it spiking blood sugar. However, you can build a bowl of oatmeal in a smart way, while still gaining the heart-healthy benefits of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber known for its cholesterol-lowering effects,” says Pendleton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Oats also contain phenolic compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are linked to reduced stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To reap these benefits, Pendleton recommends choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;steel-cut or rolled oats&lt;/a&gt; over instant oats, which are more processed and may be more rapidly digested. She also advises pairing your oatmeal with a source of protein, healthy fat and extra fiber, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251317/oatmeal-with-fruit-nuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts&lt;/a&gt;, to make your breakfast a more well-rounded meal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are an excellent, affordable food to help improve cardiovascular health, despite getting a bad rap about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827647/what-is-the-lectin-free-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lectins&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation on social media,” says Pendleton. Lectins are proteins associated with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The reality is that properly soaking and cooking beans helps to neutralize lectins, making them not only safe but incredibly nutritious.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pendleton highlights that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; are rich in artery-protective soluble fiber. This fiber binds to cholesterol in the intestines and removes it through the stool. Studies suggest that this effect plays a major role in reducing stroke mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beans are also rich in potassium and magnesium, making them a powerhouse for heart and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If beans aren’t already a staple in your diet, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-tostadas-8769923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas&lt;/a&gt; for a hearty dish that is flavorful and satisfying.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu often gets dismissed as a “fake” food that disrupts your hormones, but there’s no evidence that this plant-powered protein is harmful—in fact, it can be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incredibly beneficial&lt;/a&gt;. Made from soybeans through a natural curdling process (similar to cheese), tofu has been a staple ingredient in Asian cuisine for centuries. “Tofu is rich in isoflavones, a type of antioxidant that can support healthy blood pressure. A meta-analysis found that higher consumption of soy products like tofu was linked to a lower risk of stroke,” says Rouse.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with enjoying the foods and drinks mentioned above, both dietitians suggest embracing these lifestyle and dietary habits to further reduce your risk of stroke:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Mediterranean or DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;These diets are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with moderate amounts of fish, lean protein and low-fat dairy. They also emphasize limiting processed foods and added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, like walking or biking, per week. In addition, dedicate two days a week to muscle-strengthening exercises like lifting weights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;When you give up smoking, your risk of having a stroke goes down significantly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try making a list of reasons why you want to quit, setting a date and outlining a plan to combat nicotine cravings. A health care professional can also help navigate you through this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re getting seven to nine hours of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060332/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. It’s also important to get treatment if you have sleep apnea, which is linked to increased stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many misconceptions about what you should and shouldn’t eat to lower your stroke risk. Unfortunately, many foods are labeled as “bad” based on half-truths that are not firmly rooted in science. The full truth is that many of these foods—like nuts, bananas, coffee, oatmeal, tofu and beans—contain beneficial compounds that can reduce stroke risk. So, the next time you come across a post that dismisses a food based on one component of its nutritional profile, reach out to a dietitian or a health care professional to clear up the confusion. After all, eating to improve your brain and heart health should be enjoyable, and plenty of foods can fit seamlessly into a balanced diet.&lt;br&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;“The Office of the Chief Medical Officer has identified two confirmed cases of whooping cough” and the government said that “while there is no known link between the cases, this potentially indicates that pertussis is circulating in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minister of Health, Kim Wilson explained: “Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an extremely contagious respiratory illness that primarily spreads through close contact, such as coughing or sneezing near others. While indirect transmission through the air or contaminated objects is uncommon, it remains crucial to recognize the risks posed by this illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike the common cold, pertussis bacteria can lead to severe illness, particularly in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. In rare instances, this infection can even result in fatalities. It is imperative that we take the necessary precautions to protect our most vulnerable populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson said, “The first signs of whooping cough are like a common cold. After about a week, you or your child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will make a “whoop” sound – a gasp for breath between coughs [young babies and some adults may not “whoop”]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May bring up a thick mucus, which can make you sick [vomit]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May become very red in the face [more common in adults]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although the current risk to the community remains guarded, the Chief Medical Officer strongly advises anyone with the above symptoms to consult their GP. Babies under 6 months are at an increased risk of developing problems such as dehydration, breathing difficulties, pneumonia or fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call 911 or go to the Emergency Department immediately if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your child has periods of stopping breathing and their face or lips go blue [cyanosis]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child are finding it hard to breathe properly [shallow breathing]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child have chest pain that’s worse when breathing or coughing – this could be a sign of pneumonia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your child is having fits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should see a GP urgently or call 911 if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your baby is under 6 months old and has symptoms of whooping cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child have a very bad cough that is getting worse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve been in contact with someone with whooping cough, and you’re pregnant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child has been in contact with someone with whooping cough and have a weakened immune system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whooping cough can spread very easily. It’s best to call the GP before you go in. They might suggest talking over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your GP suspects whooping cough, you may have a swab or other test taken, and you may be prescribed antibiotics to help stop it from spreading to others. Antibiotics may not reduce symptoms. You can relieve the symptoms of whooping cough by getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve discomfort. Always check doses of paracetamol or ibuprofen with a GP or pharmacist before giving them to a child aged under 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have whooping cough, you will be contagious from about 6 days after the start of cold-like symptoms to 3 weeks after coughing starts. If you start antibiotics within 3 weeks of starting to cough, it will reduce your contagious time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your healthcare provider is required by law to notify the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit [ESU] about any cases of whooping cough. If diagnosed, you may receive a call from an ESU nurse to try to prevent further spread. Please be reassured that any details you provide to the ESU nurse will be treated as medical in confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, pertussis is preventable with vaccination and the appropriate public health response to a case is to identify the immunization status of the contacts and to offer care and vaccination to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can reduce the risk of catching whooping cough by taking respiratory hygiene precautions, as with any other respiratory infection such as flu, COVID or RSV. Please cover your cough to stop the spread of respiratory infections, regularly wash your hands and avoid the 3 Cs: close contact, crowded spaces and confined places with poor ventilation.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each year, about 93 million CT scans are performed on 62 million patients across the US as a vital diagnostic tool of modern medicine. However, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ct-scans-radiation-cancer-diagnoses-study/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reports there could be a troubling side effect: a potential long-term cancer risk linked to radiation exposure. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?guestAccessKey=afde7c2e-df6b-4e7b-9ced-7a15ed74dc1d&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;, researchers estimate that CT scans performed in 2023 alone could ultimately lead to around 103,000 cases of radiation-induced cancer over the lifetimes of the patients exposed. The study's authors wrote, "If current practices persist, CT-related cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        And the projected cancer risks aren't distributed evenly. While children and adolescents are more vulnerable to radiation, adults undergo CT scans more frequently, so they account for the majority of the projected cases. The scans most commonly linked to future cancers were abdominal and pelvic CTs, followed by chest scans. The most frequent resulting cancers included lung, colon, leukemia, and bladder cancers, with breast cancer ranking second among female patients. And the study stresses that CT technology is essential, but that it must be used judiciously—with a growing need to weigh the benefits of fast, accurate imaging against potential long-term harm.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        This isn't the first time radiation from CT scans has been scrutinized. A &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/the-surprising-dangers-of-ct-sans-and-x-rays/index.htm"&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; investigation in 2015 found that up to a third of all CT scans could be medically unnecessary, while experts warn it could be difficult to limit CT imaging because its speed and relative affordability have made it ubiquitous. Still, the study's editors say the new projections should be taken seriously, likening CT-induced cancer risk to other established risk factors like alcohol consumption and obesity. As part of the solution, they recommend using radiation-free imaging alternatives when possible, lowering radiation doses in CT protocols, and educating clinicians to avoid unnecessary scans.

&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Health experts say how you age matters more than simply how long you've been alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Biological age tracks your body’s function—not just your chronological age since your birth.&lt;/li&gt;

Conversely, a lower biological age could signal better health and a longer potential lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;With longevity awareness becoming more of a focus in healthcare, a growing number of health-tech companies are developing tools to track and reverse biological aging. According to a December 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/anti-aging-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by market research firm Precedence Research, the anti-aging industry is expected to reach $140 billion by 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-b2a202e4-2 bmropA gg-dark:text-white scene:font-itc-avant-garde-gothic-pro scene:font-light"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing market of apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the number of tools claiming to track or reverse biological age is growing, too. But which ones work—and how do you choose? According to Dr. David Cheishvili, chief innovation officer at EpiMedTech Global, biological aging isn’t something that can be measured with just one number, calling it a complex process that plays out across different systems in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“There are a lot of biomarkers people talk about—telomeres, gene expression, metabolism— but in my view, DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks are currently the most reliable when it comes to estimating biological age,” Cheishvili told &lt;i&gt;Decrypt&lt;/i&gt;. “If a platform includes those and uses peer-reviewed, validated methods, that’s usually a good sign it’s grounded in solid science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Let’s break that down. DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks estimate a person’s biological age by measuring chemical changes to their DNA that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;As the co-developer of the epiAge epigenetic age test, which analyzes DNA methylation data from saliva, Cheishvili pointed out red flags that consumers should watch out for when choosing a longevity app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“The first thing to keep in mind is that these companies are selling something—and that’s fine, but it means you should be cautious,” he said. “If you see big claims about reversing aging with a supplement and there’s no scientific data or peer-reviewed research behind it, that’s a red flag. Real change takes time, consistency, and evidence—not magic pills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Another company looking to support the tracking of biological age is Rejuve AI. Launched in 2023, Rejuve AI is an AI-powered longevity research network co-founded by Jasmine Smith and Dr. Ben Goertzel, the founder of decentralized AI developer SingularityNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Earlier this month,, Rejuve AI launched “&lt;a href="https://www.rejuve.ai/longevity-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;Longevity&lt;/a&gt;,” a mobile app that tracks several metrics, including weight, sleep, and diet. These metrics are combined to give users their biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Biological age is becoming something that we need to develop biomarkers for when we talk about measuring how much we’ve improved or reversed aging,” Smith told &lt;i&gt;Decrypt&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Rejuve.AI’s recently launched Longevity app is part of a broader decentralized science movement that uses wearable integrations, health data, and artificial intelligence to estimate and help reduce users' biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Smith noted that interest in health and longevity is growing every year, driven by high-profile moments like the release of &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/205729/bryan-johnson-longevity-blueprint-sleep-gene-therapy-kate-tolo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;’s Netflix documentary “Don’t Die,” and the popularity of concepts like Blue Zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Initiatives like Make America Healthy Again are also pushing conversations about food quality and long-standing health concerns into the spotlight,” she said. “At the same time, personalized and preventative care is gaining traction—even in mainstream medicine, where more clinicians are embracing holistic approaches. It’s an exciting time to be part of this shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;A number of other platforms also help track biological age and offer insights into aging. &lt;a href="https://store.insidetracker.com/products/innerage?srsltid=AfmBOoqRjMj_RaDIKuw0G9xQ5riw2DP1-S3m3MBDrtQwK1cELGFFatJW" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;InsideTracker’s InnerAge 2.0&lt;/a&gt; uses blood biomarkers to estimate age and give personalized health tips.

It’s giving us new ways to analyze complex data and spot patterns we wouldn’t catch otherwise,” Cheishvili said. “For researchers working in aging, AI feels a bit like what calculators were to mathematicians—it doesn’t do the thinking for you, but it makes the work so much faster and more powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Building on that potential, Dr. Helen Messier, chief medical and science officer at Fountain Life, said AI is already making meaningful progress in health and longevity.

Someone weighing 185lbs would burn 56 calories per hour, totaling 392 to 504 calories burned per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone will burn the same calories at the same rate, Dr Cassidy Jenkins, a psychology expert at Welltech, explained - saying it all depends on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9887363/Metabolism-Rate-calorie-burning-stays-stable-decades-doesnt-decline-youre-SIXTY.html"&gt;a person's basal metabolic rate (BMR)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of calories your body burns at rest to maintain basic bodily functions like breathing and circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And each person's BMR is influenced by factors such as weight, age, sex, and overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the ability to burn any number of calories without hitting the gym is appealing to even the laziest of couch potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Getting a full night’s sleep burns hundreds of calories. While the body rests every night, it undergoes a range of processes to repair tissues, consolidate memories, conserve energy, and regulate hormone levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone can check their nightly calorie burn by calculating their BMR. For men, the formula is as follows: 66 + (6.2 multiplied by weight in pounds) + (12.7 multiplied by height in inches) – (6.76 multiplied by age in years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women can calculate their BMR using the formula: 655.1 + (4.35 multiplied by weight in pounds) + (4.7 multiplied by height in inches) – (4.7 multiplied by age in years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Online calculators can also easily determine your BMR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Once you’ve calculated your BMR, divide that number by 24 [to get your hourly calorie burn], then multiply it by the number of hours you typically sleep,’ Dr Jenkin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to BMR, the number of calories burned at night also depends on a person’s body mass and composition, age, sex, sleep quality, and underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended number of hours of sleep to aim for per night are seven to nine. During this time, the body undergoes approximately four to six sleep cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When falling asleep, the body transitions from light sleep to deep sleep, and then to REM sleep, where dreaming occurs most frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;REM burns the most calories. During this phase, the brain is highly active, processing emotions and consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart rate and breathing become irregular and sometimes faster, while the body’s normal ability to regulate temperature becomes less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This raises the body’s demand for energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the dreaming that occurs in the brain in this stage also requires fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A majority of U.S. adults, 57 percent, say they would feel better if they got more sleep, while 42 percent say they get as much sleep as they need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While burning up to 500 calories doing nothing sounds nice, sleeping shouldn't be a substitute for regular exercise, Dr Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While these totals are surprisingly significant, about the same calorie burn as a 30 to 45-minute walk, that doesn’t mean you should skip regular physical activity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘Instead, it highlights the important role rest and recovery play in your overall wellness and weight management.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 84million Americans struggle to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep every night and a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"&gt; survey&lt;/a&gt; by Gallup reported approximately 57 percent of Americans would feel better if they could get more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 20 percent of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/wellness-us/article-13092389/Sleeping-fewer-seven-hours-heart-disease.html"&gt;sleep five hours or fewer every night, a habit that deprives the brain of crucial nightly rejuvenation and the body of necessary hormone and energy regulation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep deprivation also raises cortisol levels, which can encourage fat storage and disrupts hunger hormones, such as ghrelin and leptin, thereby increasing appetite and cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, sleep deprivation can slow down metabolism and impair decision-making, often leading to unhealthy food choices and late-night snacking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together, these effects are linked to a higher risk of metabolic disorders and obesity - which impacts about 42 percent of Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system and significantly raises your risk of developing numerous forms of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To get the most out of those seven to nine hours of sleep, Dr Jenkins recommends establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will help strengthen your body's natural sleep cycle, also known as your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating a sleep environment that encourages restful sleep is also crucial, Dr Jenkins said: ‘You should avoid going to sleep in a room that’s too hot or too cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A cool space (around 65 degrees) that’s dark and quiet promotes a deeper, more restorative sleep, which is essential for metabolic recovery.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she said, prioritize physical exercise during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Regular exercise, in particular resistance training, boosts muscle mass and raises your BMR, increasing the number of calories you’re likely to burn during your sleep,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise also helps regulate the body’s circadian rhythm, reduces stress, and boosts the production of melatonin, a sleep hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Illinois residents and pet owners are being urged to use caution after a dead rabbit was diagnosed with tularemia in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1101048225389468&amp;amp;set=a.247699787390987" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1101048225389468&amp;amp;set=a.247699787390987"&gt;to the Douglas County Health Department,&lt;/a&gt; the rabbit was tested for the illness after being found in Tuscola, a community located approximately 25 miles south of Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition, a squirrel die-off was reported in the Urbana area in recent weeks, with one of the animals testing positive for the bacterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/about/index.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/about/index.html"&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;em&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a bacterium commonly found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares. Humans can become infected with the bacteria, as can domestic pets like cats and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s most commonly spread through contact with infected animals, or can be passed via tick or flea bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People infected with the bacterial disease may develop skin ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea, joint pain, muscle ache, cough and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers and landscapers are especially vulnerable to the illness, as running over animals with machinery can cause the bacteria to become airborne.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;Residents are encouraged to use insect repellant, to wear gloves when handling sick or dead animals, and to avoid mowing over dead animals, according to CDC guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pet owners are also advised not to let their cats or dogs to roam unsupervised, and to make sure that pets are receiving anti-tick and flea treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

Ten months into a gig teaching cello lessons at an after-school program in Canada, Pierce felt like they were thriving in the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7QJ3X6JY4RAFXIEDJUAVZF2UCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then a layoff notice came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5G6G2BLDQJFX7CZMIB2WAWB5RM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Embarrassed and hurt, 34-year-old Pierce, who has autism, said they struggled to understand why they’d been let go. So they turned to the Autistic Translator, an AI tool where you type in a situation you’re trying to understand, and it gives the unspoken nuances of social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WRWI4A7MBCJDBXKDXQR5MJSJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After describing their situation,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the translator generated a response: In bullet points, the AI told Pierce how their persistent questions and search for feedback was interpreted by their supervisors as incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XENAH4SARFFKXBF6NL6RWIXY7E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was kind of eye opening for me,” Pierce said. Reading feedback from an AI devoid of any human expression or emotion made the information easier to process, Pierce said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ET7B5WH5YZFHZK57JAE5Y2WAOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/about/asd-in-teenagers-adults.html#:~:text=A%20CDC%20study%20has%20estimated,high%20of%202.42%25%20in%20Massachusetts." target="_blank"&gt;2% of adults, or over 5 million people, have been diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and medical and research experts say they typically struggle to grasp unspoken rules and guidelines, resulting in confusing or awkward social interactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J2KS75OM3VES3KFG4FHPIZKJ7E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;AI tools like the Autistic Translator&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;or Goblin Tools&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;claim to help people like Pierce better understand social situations. Some autism researchers have found reasons to be optimistic about AI’s value, saying it can be a great companion to other therapeutic tools. But many experts and users agree that these AI tools — helpful as they are — still need a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QOJDJ3MKDJGSFPNWFVLW6RXKNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Autistic Translator and similar tools are especially helpful for people with autism because those people generally think in terms of rules, said  Elizabeth Laugeson, clinical professor and director of UCLA’s Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills, who works with autistic individuals to develop social skills and maintain relationships. The tools can help users confirm their comprehension of an interaction or event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SXKT4OFMNAE3EJMILZTOJFQIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Laugeson remains cautious about AI’s use beyond general yes or no prompts. That’s because AI doesn’t understand the social nuances, context or conversational patterns needed to provide accurate and helpful responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A2P7CPYQWFBWDPPSPXV3OJOJIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If we have an overreliance on an AI to navigate the social situation then we might also be discouraging things like self-advocacy or personalized support … which we know are really critical for their growth and for independence,” Laugeson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSEPJ5YFIFHIHFPHKV6LCVHOJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Autistic Translator was built using advice from therapists, and the bot generates answers based on published scientific research and responses in online forums about autism. Its founder, Michael Daniel, who is autistic and has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), says its instant responses make the AI chatbot helpful and popular among users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GKVQHLHBH5GYLIW7NLEH6YAADM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I found it really took the emotional sting out of the situation and helped process through those things much faster than I normally would’ve,” Daniel said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPHGRXJO7FF2VGILU3WZ3PJ7TI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The 34-year-old created Autistic Translator from his home in Newcastle, Australia, after losing his job in August. Daniel, who also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;has a daughter with autism and a son with ADHD, said living in a home with different neurotypes made communicating hard. If he could use AI to communicate at work, he could use it to do the same at home, he thought. Daniel released the AI tool to the public via a Reddit post, garnering thousands of positive interactions overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NFIIB64LJAM5O5FJG7GRJB7GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using his background as a data analyst, Daniel built the translator using OpenAI’s ChatGPT models.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; Today, he says it has more than 3,000 downloads, and it costs $4 to $12 a month depending on the tier. Since then, Daniel made the service into an app called NeuroTranslator and expanded its translation capabilities to users with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7KI5UTYJYRAU7LGQQXAS74E4XI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other tools that claim to help neurodiverse people. Bram De Buyser created Goblin Tools, a website that offers eight different AI chatbot tools geared for all neurotypes. Users can ask questions or put down their scrambled thoughts into different AI tools to mitigate tasks such as creating to-do lists, mapping out tasks, and weighing pros and cons. While Goblin Tools doesn’t translate social situations, tools like “The Formalizer” help users convey their thoughts in the way they want it to come across to avoid miscommunication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FOGJCKCJ3JAZHL4RNCYD2YWEDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;AI tools are particularly popular among people on the autism spectrum because unlike humans, AI never gets tired of answering questions, De Buyser said in an interview. “They don’t tire, they don’t get frustrated, and they don’t judge the user for asking anything that a neurotypical might consider weird or out of place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4C6C57GU6BEABNMIZTVGRISJBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lawrence Fung, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, said the Autistic Translator can be a great tool to improve communication and articulate what is going on in their social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UY4HVAG3QBEV3OUI7DAH4JX77M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I think that they can definitely learn from it,” Fung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SEEAMNZW6NFR5NJOLSNREZ5DPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, autistic people don’t always get the whole picture and because the AI is reliant on the user’s understanding of the situation, it can result in inaccurate outputs, Fung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYBPQHL36ZCLJME62EKHMZY4CM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For 22-year-old Eva Dale,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;understanding the entire picture of certain social situations&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;can be a challenge. The bakery worker from Connecticut often finds that people say one thing when they really mean another. Deciphering what people mean isn’t intuitive for Dale, who has autism and relies on direct translations from her mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZXEZPVMKO5HWZNNBDUUXTIHVBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During one instance, Dale’s grandmother mentioned multiple times that her dog needed to go out, meaning it needed to be walked, but Dale interpreted it literally to take the dog outside. Later, Dale’s mom explained that her grandmother was really asking her to walk the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PBOMCKIALBHRDPV3RERO3S6ESE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“A lot of times, people say something like the dog has to go out, and it means a secret message like ‘Will you take the dog out?’ They won’t tell you the secret message and expect you to know it,” Dale said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HHYNSM6BW5A3JLJWKCV3DM3TKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Skeptical, Dale entered the interaction into the Autistic Translator. To her surprise, she got the same response her mom had given her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X5C2MGA5U5E57CYSGBIPUS2HFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I feel like the program understands at least somewhat the autistic brain in general. It’s actually very impressive that it can understand such a wide range of people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DH4BYBSR7JAFTJWOQ2H5AQZH5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, not all users get direct answers. After coming across the Autistic Translator on Reddit, Phillip Lee, a 28-year-old from California, tested out the AI tool on multiple occasions but ultimately decided that he’d prefer to get feedback from the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LDIFVVEYIZDG3EA62WML6BUCOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Understanding tone, social cues and other nonverbal language has always been a challenge for Lee, who has autism and ADHD. He was reprimanded last year by his graduate program committee for delivering jokes at inappropriate times. He also heard from his peers and colleagues that his blunt tone and lack of eye contact came off as dismissive. Frustrated, Lee sought to better understand his cognitive difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BRUE512F2D3GV27Z9CNZY9F1Q8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Asking the translator how people perceive his mannerisms helped Lee clarify some things, like when he asked the AI: “Why do people get mad when I don’t smile?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJGPFF3WXZFI7LF4ZJ52IGLAEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The translator responded, “Neurotypicals often rely on smiles as a nonverbal cue for friendliness, while this might not be a natural expression for autistics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5QVUM73DDBCBHNCAZVNNFQV4PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This made sense to Lee. As he entered more specific scenarios from his personal life such as “Why do I get so angry?” the responses grew more vague and general, sometimes not even getting a response at all because of the complicated nature of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZK5TPE4JJDD7FPBYE5ZNW5ZGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Daniel says that users are given a disclaimer about the translator’s capabilities, and that people don’t have to agree with everything the AI tool says. The Autistic Translator is programmed to acknowledge and redirect any questions about complex topics like violence, drugs and medical advice and divert back to communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IV26NHOW5CIFA3TOUG5ISUOWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wary of the AI’s ability to factor in the context and dynamics of his life, Lee prefers to hear feedback directly from his colleagues and family now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RYWTEPPNV5ENTFS4UAIPORYWQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s informational but not holistic enough to suffice as a solution for everything,” Lee said of the AI tool. “There is no road map nor a flowchart because the autistic experience is an individualized experience that requires so much time and patience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D3MLAXHDC5C57HVVZOO6JQTFTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for Pierce, the translator recently helped them navigate a tricky relationship question. Reading the feedback reassured Pierce they were reading the situation correctly and gave them confidence to start a conversation with their friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CLD6LJHENFEVZES6YYGIGB6K4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That rarely happens to me — feeling prepared for a conversation,” Pierce said. “The response from the AI made me feel validated and relieved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:31:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNTWo2RXNKb0RRT19ZakxTOFhaTnNpTGFBYmZDWjhJNkVSSjJMMEJtcXVBQU51RmF6d1BhdWlUYmp6ZjJabXZJSUJtVFhLZEg5WUlTY2g1ZUZDT0VqUU9GSWdibHBxMGVSY2l0VHRJc3V2NzNtYTNIckVYaXRybDlPRFVfMnFxaFFoWlFB</guid></item><item><title>据医生称，常用药丸可能会使预期寿命缩短近6年-雅虎 | A Common Pill May Shorten Life Expectancy by Nearly 6 Years, According to Doctors - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPZ3hZc0gxRkhKS0JUTGFIUG1ITjFPeVpsZE04Vnl5cUZDRllsQ3BDZTMyRFI3R1pOeXhweC12V2NwcHFLUzNqUGZobnMwSlJsbVh1UHRlNDFmQldDc1VKZ2VaQ3dDUjJzNUhWRHZEUnRTNGtJTklyc25HNEd2bWlyeA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trouble sleeping?

But like with any drug, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/suvorexant-may-prevent-alzheimers-according-to-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleeping pills;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/a&gt; have side effects ranging from daytime drowsiness to concentration issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While most side effects of sleeping pills are temporary, there now appears to be one that's more...life-altering.

People were surveyed on their sleep quality, how long they slept and if they used sleeping pills. Medical tests ruled out any prior health conditions that could have also affected a person's risk of dying early. Based on their sleep schedule, people were divided into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;extremely short sleepers (slept less than 4 hours a night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;short sleepers (slept 4-6 hours a night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;medium sleepers (slept 6-8 hours a night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;long sleepers (slept over 8 hours)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who did not use sleeping pills and regularly slept 6 to 8 hours a night had the lowest mortality risk than people who slept less than 4 hours and over 8 hours. One interesting finding, however, was that people who also slept 6 to 8 hours a night but took sleeping pills had a 55% higher mortality risk than non-users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our results are staggering to say the least. Many people rely on sleeping pills to help them sleep, so it’s a shock to find that taking them may more than double your mortality risk," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eck.org.tw/en/team/yu-sun/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Yu Sun, MD, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Yu Sun, MD, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at En Chu Kong Hospital in Taiwan who led the study, in a press release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors also observed that sleeping pill users have a shorter life expectancy than non-users. Men's life expectancy was 5.3 years shorter, and women's was 5.7 years shorter. Additionally, sleeping pill users had a higher cancer death rate than nonusers who slept 6 to 8 hours a night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1399416/kaitlin-vogel/chronic-insomnia-patient-journey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What One Woman With Chronic Insomnia Does to Sleep Better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;What One Woman With Chronic Insomnia Does to Sleep Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Could Sleeping Pills Be Affecting Mortality Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep scientists don't know for certain whether it's the sleeping pills that are causing the increased risk of death. &lt;a href="https://readyo2.com/meet-emma-lin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Emma Lin, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Emma Lin, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pulmonary and sleep medicine physician at ReadyO2, says people who need sleeping pills every night tend to have other health problems, including depression, anxiety or respiratory problems. All three are independently linked to poor health that may contribute to an early death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, if sleeping pills are really to blame, sleep doctors have some explanations for how this could be happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, many sleeping pills are benzodiazepines (think Klonopin or Xanax), a type of medication that slows down activity in your brain. &lt;a href="https://sleeplessinarizona.com/ruchir-p-patel-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ruchir Patel, MD, FACP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Ruchir Patel, MD, FACP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep medicine physician and owner of The Insomnia and Sleep Institute of Arizona, says using benzodiazepines for a long time is linked to memory problems and decreased concentration. It may also start to change people's emotional states and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These effects can indirectly contribute to increased mortality risk by affecting daily functioning and increasing the likelihood of accidents, especially in older adults," Dr. Patel explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has also been &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2773826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; linking benzodiazepine use with an increase in mortality among people 65 or younger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who use benzodiazepines in general also have 66% greater odds of ending up hospitalized or dying, Dr. Patel warns. "When benzodiazepines are combined with non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists, the odds of serious health outcomes nearly quadruple," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/healthy-habit-thats-taking-years-102500219.html" data-ylk="slk:The 'Healthy' Habit That's Taking Years Off Your Life ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;The 'Healthy' Habit That's Taking Years Off Your Life &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Should You Stop Using Sleeping Pills?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study results are concerning, there are some limitations to consider before flushing your pills. First, the authors were only observing people's behavior and how it may affect their mortality risk. The higher death rate could be from an unexplained illness, not the sleeping pills. Second, the study relied on people's recall of their nighttime habits, and memory of events can get fuzzy. Third, while questionnaires were filled out at every annual visit, only the results from the first visit were used in the calculations. It's possible that changes in sleep behavior and the use of sleeping pills changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lin recommends talking with your doctor before you stop taking sleeping pills, explaining, "Stopping by yourself is risky. Certain sleep pills have to be tapered off, or your sleep will become worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He adds that when working with patients, he tries to get to the root of what's causing the sleeplessness in the first place: "Is it stress? Is sleep apnea, in that they are not breathing at night? Do they have lung problems which cause them to have trouble breathing when they are in bed? If we know the cause, then we can treat the problem, not cover it up with a pill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/4-things-almost-everyone-lives-002500834.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: 4 Things Almost Everyone Who Lives to 100 Has In Common, According to Longevity Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: 4 Things Almost Everyone Who Lives to 100 Has In Common, According to Longevity Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPZ3hZc0gxRkhKS0JUTGFIUG1ITjFPeVpsZE04Vnl5cUZDRllsQ3BDZTMyRFI3R1pOeXhweC12V2NwcHFLUzNqUGZobnMwSlJsbVh1UHRlNDFmQldDc1VKZ2VaQ3dDUjJzNUhWRHZEUnRTNGtJTklyc25HNEd2bWlyeA</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，身材较高的学生在学校的表现往往略好一些- PsyPost | Taller students tend to perform slightly better in school, new research finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQNkJUWHdLQnZvSGtSXzhVVlVUb0Q4V1U2QmgzWk9GYlVYX1ZTaHEzVjhrcFdGMVNOMHpScHFGMlpMdUNuTkxPcEtKMUJrRWhIUm9LNDEzZEVyc09mMjZGdWhLX3M0QUlLSlJ6R01vcGdjUDlBYnZQZERYUzZWMkQyTy1yNERYUVFFalQ5dmVOa0tfZ3RpVFY2a2txSW5RdHRQSE04?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2025.101488" target="_blank"&gt;Economics and Human Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that taller students, on average, perform a little better on standardized tests than their shorter peers. Drawing on a large sample of students in New York City public schools, the study found that each standard deviation increase in height was associated with modestly higher scores in both English Language Arts and math across grades 3 through 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted this study to better understand why taller individuals often earn higher wages in adulthood, a pattern well-documented in prior research. One possible explanation is that taller individuals may have had academic advantages earlier in life, which could partly explain their later success in the labor market. While previous studies hinted at a link between height and early academic performance, this research aimed to examine that relationship more directly using a large, recent dataset from a major urban school district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a well-known result in the social sciences that taller men and women have higher earnings than shorter ones in countries all over the world,” said Stephanie Coffey, an assistant professor of economics at Saint Anselm College, who conducted the research along with Amy Ellen Schwartz of the University of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has offered a few possible explanations for the phenomenon. One explanation is social channels (i.e. taller people may be more self-confident, or may be perceived more positively by others). Another is that height is positively associated with ability (taller individuals tend to score higher on tests of cognitive ability than shorter ones). So, maybe it’s ability that is rewarded on the labor market, rather than height &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since academic achievement is an important determinant of eventual earnings, we were curious whether taller children might similarly perform better on state standardized tests during school. A great dataset from the New York City Department of Education that has annual measures of height and test scores for students enrolled in NYC public schools facilitated the analysis. A huge plus of these data is that they allow us to compare students directly to their peers within the same school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset included longitudinal data from nearly 500,000 students enrolled in New York City public schools between 2010 and 2017. It contained detailed records of student height measurements, standardized test scores in math and English Language Arts, demographic characteristics, and other information such as obesity status and school attendance. Height was standardized relative to same-sex, same-grade peers within each school to capture a student’s height standing among classmates. The researchers then used regression models to examine how differences in height related to differences in test performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed a consistent, though small, association between height and academic achievement. Among boys, each one standard deviation increase in height was associated with a 0.03 standard deviation increase in math scores and a 0.039 standard deviation increase in English scores. Among girls, the corresponding increases were 0.034 and 0.04 standard deviations. Although these numbers may seem small, they add up over time. For instance, the tallest 2.5% of boys and girls in their grade performed around 0.18 to 0.19 standard deviations better in English compared to the shortest 2.5%, a difference that can be meaningful in large-scale educational assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our primary finding is that boys and girls who are taller than their grade mates score higher in math and English Language Arts in every grade between 3-8 (the years in which tests are administered),” Coffey told PsyPost. “The size of the effect is small on average, but large enough to yield substantial disparities in achievement between the tallest and shortest kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, after we control for some basic demographic characteristics, the tallest 2.5% of boys and girls score about 20% of one standard deviation higher in English Language arts than the shortest 2.5% of boys and girls in the same grade and school. An educational intervention is typically viewed as having a meaningful impact if it improves test scores by 10% of one standard deviation, so we consider this to be a pretty large effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that height relative to classmates, not just absolute height, also appeared to matter. Students who ranked higher in height compared to their peers tended to do slightly better in English, even after accounting for their actual height. This suggests that social perceptions tied to being taller than one’s peers might play a small role in academic performance, at least in language-related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something else our data allow us explore whether it is simply being &lt;em&gt;tall&lt;/em&gt; that explains the effect, or being &lt;em&gt;taller&lt;/em&gt; than peers specifically,” Coffey explained. “We can tease this out because the distribution of height varies between schools, so a student may be relatively tall or short for his grade depending on the heights of his peers. Essentially, our estimates show that if you compare two students of the same height in the same grade (but at different schools) the student who attends a school where he is relatively tall compared to peers will score slightly higher in English Language Arts than the same-height student who attends a school where he is relatively short. This suggests that social benefits of height are at least part of the story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important part of the study was testing whether health could explain the relationship between height and achievement. Taller students might be healthier, and healthier students might perform better in school. To examine this possibility, the researchers controlled for obesity status and found that the relationship between height and achievement actually grew stronger after accounting for obesity. They also tested whether taller students were less likely to miss school, finding very little evidence that absenteeism played a meaningful role. This suggests that the observed height-achievement link is unlikely to be explained by better health among taller students alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the possibility that family background or early childhood conditions might explain both greater height and better academic performance, the researchers estimated models that controlled for each student’s fixed characteristics over time. Once they accounted for these unchanging traits, the relationship between height and test scores weakened considerably, but still remained statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what surprised us most was how robust the height achievement relationship is,” Coffey told PsyPost. “We find it in both math and English Language Arts achievement in every grade between 3-8 and for every racial/ethnic group we look at. Given social norms around height, we thought the ‘height premium’ might be larger for boys, but we found very similar effects for boys and girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are robust across multiple statistical models, the study does have limitations. The researchers could not directly measure early childhood conditions, such as prenatal health or family socioeconomic status during infancy, which likely contribute to both height and academic performance. Nor could they fully separate the effects of social treatment based on height from the effects of innate ability or other factors. Although the fixed-effects models help address some of these concerns, they cannot completely rule out all potential sources of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main caveat is that we’re limited in our ability to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive the academic height premium,” Coffey noted. “We looked at attendance and found that shorter kids really aren’t absent more frequently than taller ones, so we don’t think it’s about health. However, it’s difficult to untangle how much of the effect might arise through early childhood advantage (that leads kids to be tall and to do well in school) vs. any social benefits of height &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re interested in exploring, more generally, how physical characteristics shape the way kids experience school. One way we could extend our research on height is by looking into the NYC School Climate Survey, which asks students about how they perceive the school environment, teachers and peers. We’ve also discussed the possibility of conducting similar analyses looking at childhood obesity rather than height. Something else we think might be very interesting is exploring how the switch to online schooling during Covid may have affected these relationships. Does your height matter if your peers only view you through Zoom?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2025.101488" target="_blank"&gt;Towering Intellects?

Using a patented immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) technology, they measured the misfolding of the alpha-synuclein (αSyn) protein, a key driver of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial, as clinical symptoms usually appear only after severe and irreversible brain damage.

Dopamine supplements can compensate for the loss and temporarily alleviate the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The misfolding of the key protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) from α-helical structures to β-sheet-rich structures plays a crucial role in the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes, so-called oligomers. The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain,” explains Professor Klaus Gerwert, founding and managing director at PRODI and CEO of betaSENSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced platform technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two independent clinical cohorts with a total of 134 participants, the Bochum-based researchers showed that, with a sensitivity and specificity of well over 90 percent, this misfolding of αSyn in body-fluids is a viable biomarker for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted using cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients at the Parkinson’s centers in Bochum (St. Josef Hospital, Professor Lars Tönges, Professor Ralf Gold) and Kassel (Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Dr. Sandrina Weber, Professor Brit Mollenhauer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurements were carried out using the patented iRS (immuno-infrared sensor) technology from betaSENSE GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;betaSENSE has already successfully implemented the iRS technology for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. In this case, it was shown that the misfolding of the biomarker Aβ can indicate the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia at a later stage with high accuracy up to 17 years before clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson’s for the misfolding of αSyn,” stresses Klaus Gerwert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of Parkinson’s drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to diagnostic applications, the technology can also help to develop new active substances and prove their efficacy in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dec1d8ddd59ac3d1ddd8d1c6f4c6c1d69ad0d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julia Weiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rub.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julia Weiler – RUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44321-025-00229-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alpha-synuclein Misfolding as Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Measured with the iRS Platform&lt;/a&gt;” by Klaus Gerwert et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-synuclein Misfolding as Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Measured with the iRS Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) play a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite considerable advances in diagnostics, an early and differential diagnosis of PD still represents a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We innovated the immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) platform for measuring αSyn misfolding. We analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from two cohorts comprising PD cases, atypical Parkinsonian disorders, and disease controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained an AUC of 0.90 (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 134, 95% CI 0.85–0.96) for separating PD/MSA from controls by determination of the αSyn misfolding by iRS. Using two thresholds divided individuals as unaffected/affected by misfolding with an intermediate area in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the affected/unaffected cases, controls versus PD/MSA cases were classified with 97% sensitivity and 92% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectral data revealed misfolding from an α-helical/random-coil αSyn in controls to β-sheet enriched αSyn in PD and MSA cases. Moreover, a first subgroup analysis implied the potential for patient stratification in clinically overlapping cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iRS, directly measuring all αSyn conformers, is complementary to the αSyn seed-amplification assays (SAAs), which however only amplify seeding competent conformers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:10:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5SM2hUcGczYlFWQTM1aTNfNEtzVGJoc3FjeXFHWjZFQ0sxUmgxVHJNNW1OM3NNQjFYYmpuQUREWWNWcm12M20weGRMdlUycXE2bVU5bW8zSk90bEtJYjJlcEJCM3lodTRTN2lzZzhwUmlOZk14</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，如果你不吃早餐，你的身体会发生什么。- Stewartville Star | Here’s what happens to your body if you skip breakfast, according to an expert. - Stewartville Star</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPQzE2TVdwa3B2NUY5VjlXZmpJa2V0cnM2dXVOUk9NQTBOTS1LTlVYZlJlOVRPakJYZ3lqNmtqM0xmWGJjeXFMWmN2Ul9hX090X1FzYmNSano5aGt2Uy1Jb0N3eHotSmdEai1ZTGM1Sk1aU1llMDB4ZlQxQmlRN0tza0dYSDVDZXhoSHBWWHdLcEZuUl82aDVtNVBuSTRYQmsxSTlnRWhlazFSenV1Nnk3RFZBdzNaRXZmOGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking the overnight fast with a morning meal has long been considered a nutritional cornerstone. Yet, millions regularly skip breakfast, either through habit or deliberate intermittent fasting practices. A nutrition expert has recently revealed surprising effects this common habit has on your body, challenging conventional wisdom about the “most important meal of the day.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The surprising metabolic impact of skipping breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you finish your evening meal around 8 PM, your body begins a natural fasting period. By midnight, your blood sugar typically returns to normal levels. By 6 AM, after approximately ten hours without food, your digestive system has essentially reset itself. If you then continue to delay your first meal, your metabolism enters an interesting state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-2761774683"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The twelve-hour mark is when your body transitions to fat-burning mode,” explains dietitian Wintertok7, who has studied breakfast habits extensively. “Around 10 AM, this fat-burning process accelerates significantly, especially if you’ve incorporated morning exercise into your routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/25/heres-the-actual-distance-you-should-walk-every-day-to-get-back-in-shape/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Here’s the actual distance you should walk every day to get back in shape.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This metabolic shift represents the core benefit many intermittent fasting enthusiasts seek. By extending the overnight fast until midday, your body maintains this fat-burning state for longer periods. Breaking your fast around noon with a protein-rich meal that includes healthy fats and fiber helps maintain stable blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1422578327"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that this approach may help avoid insulin spikes that typically follow carbohydrate-heavy breakfast options. For those working toward &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/01/doctor-reveals-five-hidden-effects-of-stopping-alcohol-for-30-days-has-on-the-brain/"&gt;specific health goals&lt;/a&gt;, this metabolic advantage could complement other healthy habits like reducing alcohol consumption.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Energy regulation and cognitive function without morning meals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morning fasting creates distinct energy patterns throughout the day. Without the immediate glucose influx from breakfast, your body maintains more stable energy levels by drawing from fat stores. This can prevent the mid-morning energy crashes many experience after consuming sugar-laden breakfast options.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cognitive function responses vary significantly between individuals. Some report enhanced mental clarity during extended morning fasts, while others experience concentration difficulties, irritability, or decreased productivity. These variations often relate to metabolic flexibility—how efficiently your body switches between glucose and fat for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/15/heres-what-to-do-if-you-wake-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-and-cant-get-back-to-sleep-according-to-this-expert/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Here’s what to do if you wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep, according to this expert&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutrition expert Nicci Roscoe notes, “While intermittent fasting works beautifully for some, others genuinely need that morning metabolic kickstart to function optimally.” Individual factors like sleep quality, stress levels, and activity demands all influence your morning nutritional needs.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking to improve their mental resilience, breakfast timing may be worth examining. The relationship between nutritional habits and psychological fortitude is complex, as demonstrated in studies of &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/people-who-recover-quickly-failure-tend-display-these-8-traits/"&gt;traits associated with resilience&lt;/a&gt;. Your breakfast choices—or decision to skip—may influence how effectively you handle daily challenges.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Who should reconsider the breakfast-skipping trend&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite potential benefits for some, breakfast remains crucial for specific populations. Growing children and adolescents typically require regular morning nutrition to support development and academic performance. Athletes with high energy demands often benefit from early fueling to optimize training quality and recovery.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with blood sugar regulation issues, including diabetes or hypoglycemia, should approach breakfast skipping cautiously. Similarly, those taking certain medications requiring food or experiencing certain digestive conditions may need consistent morning meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/05/after-knee-surgery-a-17yo-teenager-forgets-his-native-language/"&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those juggling busy schedules, combining breakfast skipping with &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/05/is-walking-1-mile-per-day-enough-to-reap-health-benefits-experts-weigh-in/"&gt;simple exercise habits like daily walking&lt;/a&gt; may provide manageable health improvements. However, breakfast timing should complement rather than complicate your overall wellness approach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People struggling with disordered eating patterns should be particularly mindful about meal timing strategies. What begins as intermittent fasting can sometimes reinforce problematic relationships with food. Working with nutrition professionals helps ensure fasting practices support rather than undermine health goals.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Finding your optimal breakfast strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than viewing breakfast habits through a rigid lens, nutrition experts increasingly recommend personalized approaches based on individual responses. Self-experimentation with different meal timing patterns—while tracking energy, hunger, mood, and performance metrics—can reveal your optimal strategy.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you decide breakfast benefits you, prioritize protein-rich options while minimizing sugar and caffeine. This approach provides sustained energy without dramatic blood sugar fluctuations. For those who thrive without breakfast, ensuring adequate nutrition during eating windows becomes especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/04/how-long-should-you-walk-per-day-for-effective-weight-loss-a-fitness-coach-explains/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing self-awareness around hunger signals represents a crucial skill regardless of your breakfast preference. Learning to distinguish between habitual eating, emotional hunger, and true physiological need helps create sustainable nutrition patterns that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/20/if-you-want-boost-your-confidence-say-goodbye-these-8-self-doubting-behaviors/"&gt;boost confidence in your health decisions&lt;/a&gt;.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that nutritional needs evolve with life circumstances. During particularly demanding periods, you might benefit from adjusting your breakfast approach. Remaining flexible rather than dogmatic allows for adaptation to changing requirements.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, protect your dietary choices from unnecessary social pressure. Whether you’re a breakfast enthusiast or prefer extended morning fasts, learning &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/15/8-ways-protect-your-peace-when-dealing-toxic-people/"&gt;techniques to protect your peace&lt;/a&gt; when others challenge your well-considered habits helps maintain consistent nutrition practices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakfast debate highlights a broader nutritional truth: individualization matters more than universal rules. By understanding your unique metabolic responses, lifestyle demands, and personal preferences, you can develop morning nutrition habits that truly serve your health goals—whether that includes breakfast or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/03/this-little-known-leafy-vegetable-is-actually-the-secret-to-youth-among-the-japanese-and-koreans/"&gt;

More specifically, the study found that eating 150 grams or more of processed meat per week increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 46% and the risk of early death by 50%, compared to eating no processed meat. The study authors also noted that processed meat consists of any type of meat that is “salted, cured, or treated with preservatives and/or food additives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While removing foods like processed meats from your diet (or limiting them) is a great way to stay healthy, keeping your heart health in check requires a multifaceted approach consisting of not only a healthy diet but also proper exercise and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for even more ways to protect your heart, try taking our &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63743032/heart-health-quiz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health quiz&lt;/a&gt; to see how well you know the organ.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SIBO is the result of an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subtle signs of SIBO include nutritional deficiencies, rosacea, brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meet with a health care provider to discuss testing and treatment options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diverse microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is essential for overall health. However, having an excessive amount of bacteria in the small intestine can cause serious problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can cause a number of unpleasant digestive side effects and affect other areas of the body as well. “SIBO can be tricky to identify because its symptoms can mimic other digestive disorders,” says &lt;a href="https://kayteehadley.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaytee Hadley, M.S., RDN, IFMCP,&lt;/a&gt; a functional medicine dietitian specializing in SIBO and founder of Holistic Health and Wellness in Richmond, Virginia. In fact, the only way to know whether you have SIBO is by getting tested. “The most accessible way to test for SIBO is through a breath test, which measures levels of hydrogen, methane and hydrogen sulfide gases produced by bacteria in the small intestine,” says Hadley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to digestive symptoms, there are less-obvious signals that you may have SIBO and should make an appointment with a health care provider. “While the classic signs include bloating, gas and altered bowel habits, many people experience more subtle symptoms like fatigue, brain fog or nutrient deficiencies, such as low vitamin B12 or iron,” says &lt;a href="https://allieddigestivehealth.com/providers/ritu-nahar-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ritu Nahar, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a gastroenterologist with Allied Digestive Health. Here’s a closer look at four sneaky signs to be aware of. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-nutrient-deficiencies"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Nutrient Deficiencies  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; SIBO can result in malabsorption of nutrients, including iron and vitamins A, D, E and B12.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The small intestine is where the majority of nutrient absorption occurs. However, because it interferes with bile acids, which are needed to break down and absorb fats, SIBO can make it harder for your body to absorb fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Bacterial overgrowth can also affect &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676216/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-iron-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron levels&lt;/a&gt;, as up to 20% of iron is absorbed in the small intestine. As for vitamin B12, SIBO can both reduce the absorption and increase the use of this essential vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, because SIBO can cause nausea and loss of appetite, it may result in a more limited diet, which further increases the risk of nutritional inadequacies or deficiencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes in mood, brittle nails, thinning hair and increased fatigue are common symptoms of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, though the only way to know for sure is by having blood work done by a health care provider.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-brain-fog"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Brain Fog &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The gut and brain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;are strongly connected&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s no surprise that SIBO can affect cognitive functioning. Brain fog is defined as periods of mental confusion, impaired judgment, poor short-term memory and difficulty concentrating that come and go.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; People with SIBO may experience these symptoms shortly after eating, or on and off throughout the day. A small study found that among people with unexplained gas, bloating and abdominal pain, those who also experienced brain fog were more likely to have SIBO and D-lactic acidosis—a condition caused by the accumulation of D-lactic acid due to an overgrowth of certain bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-fatigue-after-eating"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Fatigue After Eating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to brain fog, SIBO can lead to extreme fatigue, which may be especially noticeable right after eating. While this fatigue may be linked to brain fog, it could also be caused by low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-b12-benefits-8676211" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; levels, resulting from impaired absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-rosacea-or-dry-skin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Rosacea or Dry Skin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rosacea is a skin disorder that can cause flushing and persistent redness and dryness on the face. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906387/best-worst-foods-for-rosacea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;certain foods may exacerbate symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, the cause of rosacea is unknown. That said, research suggests that the condition may be tied to your gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Rosacea has been associated with SIBO and may improve once you get rid of the bacterial overgrowth,” says Hadley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-manage-sibo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Manage SIBO &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve confirmed with your doctor that you have SIBO, what can you do? The experts we spoke with recommend a multifaceted approach that may include some combination of antibiotics, herbal antimicrobials and dietary changes. “Long-term success also depends on addressing the root cause, whether that’s impaired gut motility, previous surgeries or other contributing factors,” says Nahar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some potential strategies your doctor or dietitian may suggest: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Medications to Reduce the Bacterial Count&lt;/strong&gt;: “Managing SIBO starts with getting rid of the bacterial overgrowth itself,” says Hadley. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic or herbal antimicrobial to reduce the amount of bacteria in your small intestine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a Short-Term Elemental Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;A short-term elemental diet, which includes packaged medical-grade food products, works by starving the bacteria in the small intestine. While shown to be effective, elemental diets should only be done under close medical supervision.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Out Meals and Snacks:&lt;/strong&gt; “Activating the migrating motor complex allows bacteria and food to be swept through the small intestine and is helpful for symptom management and preventing SIBO from recurring once it’s gone,” says Hadley. This cycle can take anywhere from 113 to 230 minutes, so waiting at least four hours between eating can allow the cycle to complete.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow a Short-Term Elimination Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Another dietary approach is an elimination diet. “Short-term elimination diets, including the low-FODMAP and low-fermentation diet, can significantly reduce bloating, gas and discomfort by limiting the types of carbohydrates that feed bacteria in the gut,” says Hadley. That said, research is limited on whether the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; is effective for SIBO.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because elimination diets can cause nutrient deficiencies when not done carefully, it’s best to work with a registered dietitian rather than implementing one on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; SIBO may start in the small intestine, but its effects don’t stay there. Digestive discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, constipation and gas are common side effects. However, you may also experience more subtle signs of SIBO, including nutritional deficiencies, rosacea, brain fog and fatigue. If you’re concerned that you may have SIBO, talk with your doctor about testing and treatment options to manage and resolve SIBO and its effects. After all, as Nahar says, “Early identification and a comprehensive approach can make a significant difference in symptom relief and quality of life."&lt;br&gt;

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in this country (other than non-melanoma skin cancers), and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;However, how we approach screening for prostate cancer is informed by the latest understanding we have of the disease and the tools available to us for screening. Not everyone benefits from the same approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who’s at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Understanding who is most at risk is the first step for informed decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Men older than 50 and those with a family history of prostate cancer are at a higher risk of developing the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;In addition, Black men have a higher incidence of prostate cancer than men of other ethnic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Factors such as diet and weight may also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should get screened – and how?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“Screening” means checking for a potential disease in someone who has not been diagnosed with it and has no symptoms of the illness. So we have to be mindful that screening tools don’t cause more harm than the benefits they may bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Here is how I explain the two tests used for prostate cancer screening to my patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital rectal exam (DRE)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Traditionally, the DRE has been a standard component of prostate cancer screening. However, current &lt;a href="https://canadiantaskforce.ca/prostate-cancer-clinician-faq/" target="_self"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the DRE may not be necessary for all patients. The simple reason is that a doctor’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;finger can only feel about one-third of the surface of the prostate. If cancers are growing on the other sides, or growing within the prostate itself, the physician cannot feel it. As such, the test is not really useful for patients who do not have symptoms. This is why I have stopped doing the DRE as a routine part of my screening practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;In patients who do have symptoms suggesting a prostate problem (see below), we still do a DRE as part of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The PSA test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen – a protein produced by the prostate – in the blood. Elevated PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer, but they may also result from other conditions (such as bladder infections or recent urological procedures).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The Canadian Cancer Society &lt;a href="https://cancer.ca/en/treatments/tests-and-procedures/prostate-specific-antigen-psa-test" target="_self"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that average-risk individuals consider screening with the PSA test starting at age 50. It also advises that high-risk individuals, including Black men and those with a family history of prostate cancer, consider testing from age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;However, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care advises against using the PSA test for screening. Its review of nonindustry funded, primary-care literature suggests that the potential harms of the PSA test – such as false positive test results and unnecessary treatments – outweigh the potential benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://canadiantaskforce.ca/prostate-cancer-clinician-summary/" target="_self"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; published in 2014, the task force says: “For men under 55 years and 70 years and older, there is no evidence that screening with the PSA test reduces mortality whereas there is evidence of harms. For men aged 55 to 69 years, there is inconsistent evidence of a small potential benefit of screening, and evidence of harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Given such contradictory advice, what should men do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;I suggest a thorough and nuanced conversation about PSA screening with your family doctor, taking into account your medical and family history. It’s essential to discuss the limitations and potential benefits and harms of PSA testing in order to make an informed decision.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Benefits include early detection, which can potentially lead to more effective treatment. Limitations and potential harms include false-positive test results, which can lead to anxiety, plus unnecessary further testing and subsequent possible complications (for example, infection and erectile dysfunction). PSA testing can also result in overdiagnosis. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556081/#:~:text=%5B106%5D%20For%20prostate%20cancer%20screening,and%20appropriate%20follow%2Dup%20examinations." target="_self"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that up to half of prostate cancers detected through screening are overdiagnosed, meaning these cancers are slow-growing and would not have caused symptoms or death during the patient’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symptoms to monitor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;It is important to know the symptoms of prostate cancer because when they do present, it would be prudent to use the screening tools that we have available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Early-stage prostate cancer often presents without noticeable symptoms. But as the disease progresses, symptoms may include: difficulty urinating or a weak urine stream; frequent urination, especially at night; anything else unusual about urination or ejaculation (blood, pain et cetera).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While these symptoms can also be associated with other conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or infections, it is crucial to consult with your doctor for an accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preventive measures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Although there is no guaranteed method to prevent prostate cancer, certain lifestyle choices may reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while limiting red meat and high fat dairy is advised. Engaging in regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight can also reduce cancer risk, as can avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Yan Yu is a family physician in Alberta and the Northwest Territories.

Focusing on healthy behaviors and things we already love to do can help boost dopamine, the neurotransmitter involved in the pleasure and rewards system in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, dopamine rewards us when we do things we need to survive, leading you to want to do these activities more. “Dopamine benefits us because it rewards essential behaviors such as eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty or reproduction,” says &lt;a href="https://patientcare.rutgershealth.org/provider/emily-gordon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Gordon, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emily Gordon, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of medicine at &lt;a href="https://njms.rutgers.edu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers New Jersey Medical School;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/a&gt; and director of the &lt;a href="https://njms.rutgers.edu/departments/psychiatry/addiction_medicine_fellowship.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt;. “It gives you a sense of accomplishment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is dopamine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain has billions of neurons that transfer messages from one nerve cell to the next, directing all of our movements and emotions. “Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, or chemical in the brain, that is sometimes referred to as the ‘feel good neurotransmitter’ because it’s integral to the brain’s reward system, pleasure and motivation,” says &lt;a href="https://markey.camden.rutgers.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Charlotte Markey, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Charlotte Markey, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, professor of psychology at &lt;a href="https://psychology.camden.rutgers.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adultish-Body-Image-Book-Life-ebook/dp/B0CW1F16P5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Body Image Book;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Body Image Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series. “Dopamine also affects mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's natural to experience lower dopamine levels at times. “There are definitely ways you may run low on dopamine, such as when estrogen is on a downward slope when the menstrual cycle nears or during menopause,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wilfahrt-robert-p-m-d/bio-20208651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bob Wilfahrt, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bob Wilfahrt, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family doctor who specializes in ADHD at &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Other times you might just be in a lousy mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our body has evolved to do what we think is useful for survival,” explains Dr. Wilfahrt. For instance, because there was a time when loading up on carbohydrate-rich foods was helpful to avoid perishing in a famine, it makes sense that we might reach for a donut when we want to feel better today. Sometimes a donut is exactly what you need, “but there are &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g64328042/mood-boosting-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy ways to get a dopamine boost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy ways to get a dopamine boost&lt;/a&gt;,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What activities boost dopamine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no one-size-fits all for what can make you feel good. “Different people have variations in dopamine metabolism, which is why some people get a ‘runner’s high,’” says Dr. Gordon. “The activities you enjoy and that give you a sense of accomplishment are individualized.” Try a few of these healthy, science-backed methods for boosting dopamine and see what makes you feel great:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move your body.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301978/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A large body of research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A large body of research&lt;/a&gt; has found that exercise increases dopamine signaling.

Basically, you step away from a chore to stimulate dopamine by doing a pleasurable activity that gives you a sense of reward so you can go back to the task a little refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a list or “dopamine menu” of activities you enjoy. Choose activities that allow a quick break, but that won’t take up the whole afternoon, says Dr. Wilfahrt. Your list can include anything you love — petting your cat, calling a friend, stepping outside or munching on a handful of veggies or fruits. Do something on the list whenever you feel stuck in a rut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a62472953/dopamenu-benefits-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How to Create Your Own Dopamine Menu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;How to Create Your Own Dopamine Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Moyo Studio - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 12:57:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBRemtFREhDb1lmNUk5Rm1MWmJ6bzE3SGVDdDNUU0hBZTV4cTFYa09nc2xiYjJUdmRtRl9nMHFLeG9YcXFENTROM3dJN2tELU5feFJBSEJ6MlJuWV9YNTJmdE5mdk83Z2hNMGw1VzdTQWVLQQ</guid></item><item><title>医生希望你停止食用人造糖-一项新的研究显示了确切的原因- AOL.com | Doctors Want You To Stop Consuming Artificial Sugar—A New Study Shows Exactly Why - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1VcEN6ZTJrdm9GdnAwSUdpVU80MS15UGpwMjdKX2lIOHVfcl9NYzE5Z24tcWZFX1J1N3NCS3RJOTVLUC12dHVleHJqZHV2ZTJnVGpvWDJCYVNBR1NxeTlZMEwzbHQyUHhfVGsyX2VYaHdGM005RWJTakU0YUxHZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;How Fake Sugar May Impact Brain &amp;amp; Heart Health&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a sugar-free soda or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-calorie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-calorie&lt;/a&gt; candy bar seem too good to be true, that's because sometimes, they are.

Here’s what two top doctors and a dietitian want you to know about the sweetener and the potential risks it poses to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Yi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Yi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; Auburn Berry, lead study author and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers treated cells from the tiny blood vessels in the brain (known as cerebral microvascular endothelial cells) with erythritol. They discovered that cells that were exposed to the amount of sweetener in one drink serving had higher levels of oxidative stress. (In case you’re not familiar with it, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oxidative stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; is an imbalance in the body that can damage cells, lead to aging, and raise the risk of cancer and other diseases.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that cells exposed to erythritol produced less nitric oxide, which is a compound that helps blood vessels dilate. Lower levels of nitric oxide can mess with blood flow, make it hard for blood vessels to widen, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to study erythritol because it is widely marketed and consumed as a ‘safe’ sugar alternative,” says Auburn Berry, lead study author and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. “However, emerging evidence has linked erythritol intake to an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. Despite these associations, the direct biological effects of erythritol on brain endothelial cell function, which is critical for maintaining cerebrovascular health, are poorly understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is a low-calorie sugar substitute, explains Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s popular because it doesn’t impact blood glucose and levels of insulin (a hormone that helps escort glucose to your cells to be used for energy) as much as table sugar does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's often marketed as a ‘natural’ sugar substitute due to its lower glycemic index and minimal calorie content,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's widely considered safe in moderation, Keatley says that there's a growing body of research suggesting that it may not be entirely without risk, especially when consumed in larger quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is found in a lot of sugar-free products, like energy drinks, some snack foods, and protein bars. It’s also used as a sweetener in &lt;a href="https://halotop.com/pints/chocolate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Halo Top ice cream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Halo Top ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questnutrition.com%2Fproducts%2Fchocolate-chip-cookie-dough-protein-bar&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64589165%2Ferythritol-brain-heart-health-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quest bars;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Quest bars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/ca/en/about-us/faq/is-there-sugar-in-vitaminwater-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitaminwater Zero;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitaminwater Zero&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s even found in some toothpastes and mouthwashes, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Yi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Yi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;erythritol interfere with your brain and heart health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol may cause oxidative stress in brain cells by disrupting how they produce energy and “by overwhelming their natural antioxidant defenses,” Dr. Yi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweetener also seems to lower levels of nitric oxide, which helps protect cells and blood vessels, per Dr. Yi. “This imbalance leads to the buildup of harmful molecules—reactive oxygen species—which can damage cells and contribute to heart and blood vessel problems,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more research is needed to understand why the sweetener causes these changes, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it okay to consume erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is approved by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food#:~:text=The%20FDA%20permits%20the%20use,mannitol%2C%20erythritol%2C%20and%20maltitol." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) as a sweetener and is classified as “generally recognized as safe” or GRAS, meaning it’s considered safe to have in the amounts that are often found in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Keatley says it’s best to consume it sparingly. “I advise caution, particularly for those at higher risk for cardiovascular conditions,” he says. “Like any sweetener, moderation is key. It’s important to be aware of how much erythritol is consumed, especially considering its potential effects on vascular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen also recommends being mindful of how much erythritol you have on a regular basis. “Until we learn more about the negative health effects of erythritol, we should try to understand how much erythritol we are consuming from our food products, and attempt to limit our intake of erythritol as much as possible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 12:27:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1VcEN6ZTJrdm9GdnAwSUdpVU80MS15UGpwMjdKX2lIOHVfcl9NYzE5Z24tcWZFX1J1N3NCS3RJOTVLUC12dHVleHJqZHV2ZTJnVGpvWDJCYVNBR1NxeTlZMEwzbHQyUHhfVGsyX2VYaHdGM005RWJTakU0YUxHZw</guid></item><item><title>追溯听觉的起源-神经科学新闻 | Tracing the Origins of Hearing - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE1XcTA4NEgxbmROU055dzJXTF9GTTQ0WEpFUFUzV0lTMG1xU2NmRWdlaHFZVlRuZlRoRnN5eGdlcmdQUkJsOXhVdHZmbHNaNG1VcDVyTmxoVWg4Tll3NEZLZWVnTkU5NkxMRW1v?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a genetic “barcoding” method to trace how stem cells in embryos become neurons and inner ear cells. By labeling early stem cells in mice, the team followed their development and mapped the formation of the inner ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that hearing-critical cells arise from two main types of stem cells, offering clues for future hearing loss therapies. This approach provides a detailed “family tree” of nervous system development and could eventually reduce the need for animal testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Barcoding:&lt;/strong&gt; A virus-based barcode allowed researchers to trace stem cell development into neurons and inner ear cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearing Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Two main stem cell types give rise to critical inner ear structures involved in hearing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; The method could aid treatments for hearing loss and help study other parts of the nervous system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have developed a method that shows how the nervous system and sensory organs are formed in an embryo. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By labelling stem cells with a genetic ‘barcode’, they have been able to follow the cells’ developmental journey and discover how the inner ear is formed in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, could provide important insights for future treatment of hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109211"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-300x178.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-770x456.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-293x174.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-150x89.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows cells in the inner ear." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-300x178.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-770x456.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-293x174.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-150x89.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image of the inner ear.

The virus contained a genetic ‘barcode’ that was integrated into the DNA of the stem cells and then inherited as the cells divided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following this code, the researchers could track how the cells developed into different types of neurons and cells in the inner ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that cells in the inner ear, which are crucial for hearing, develop from two main types of stem cells. This knowledge could lead to new treatments for hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tracing the origin and development of cells gives us a unique opportunity to understand the basic mechanisms behind hearing loss,” says Emma Andersson. “It can help us find new ways to repair or replace damaged cells in the inner ear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the nervous system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team now plans to use the method to study other parts of the nervous system, but also how the rest of the body develops. They hope their work will lead to new insights and treatments for various genetic and developmental diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are only at the beginning of understanding the complex processes behind nervous system development,” says Emma Andersson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method opens up many exciting opportunities to explore how the nervous system and the rest of the body are formed during embryonic development.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is the foundation of health. If you’re regularly falling short of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-6-hours-of-sleep-enough-8692438" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended seven to nine hours&lt;/a&gt; per night, you’re not just lowering your body’s energy levels—you may also be increasing your risk for high cholesterol and chronic disease. “Sleep deprivation is known to increase the risk of heart disease, obesity, depression and even dementia,” says &lt;a href="https://www.drmelindasteele.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melinda Steele, M.D., DipABLM&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary-trained primary care and lifestyle medicine physician in California.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With sleep disruption comes a cascade of negative health effects, making it hard for your body to function at its best. “When you don’t get enough [sleep], key hormones that regulate appetite, blood sugar, stress and metabolism become disrupted,” says&lt;a href="https://www.wisebitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Here, health care professionals explain why a lack of restorative sleep could be the culprit behind rising cholesterol levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that inadequate sleep is significantly associated with insulin resistance. While additional studies are needed, this relationship is thought to be due to increases in inflammatory markers, like C-reactive protein, and disruptions in circadian rhythm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://stephaniedarbyrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stephanie Darby, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a functional dietitian for female runners, also points out the concern about circadian misalignment, saying that veering away from your body’s natural rhythm can negatively affect glucose metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Besides potentially increasing your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-patterns-and-duration-may-determine-diabetes-risk-8683790" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, studies show that insulin resistance is associated with elevated LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and lowered HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Without adequate sleep, our body increases cortisol production, which triggers a cascade of reactions to ‘fight’ a perceived stressor,” says&lt;a href="https://brittanyb.ca/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brittany Brown, RD, IBCLC, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Feeding Babies Nourishing Souls. Cortisol is a hormone that rises in response to stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, having high cortisol levels from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-does-stress-affect-the-body-8661817" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; can affect how your body metabolizes lipids, including cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While more research is needed, one study found that a heart-healthy diet was less effective in lowering cholesterol levels in women with high (versus low) cortisol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Negatively Affect Food Choices &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Going to bed too late may also make it harder to make healthy food choices, thanks to its effect on hunger and fullness hormones. When sleep is limited, levels of ghrelin (a hunger hormone) increase, while levels of leptin (a satiety hormone) decrease. These changes may negatively affect your food choices throughout the day and, over time, could lead to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-trying-to-lose-weight-8675388" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; and increased cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Poor sleep also makes it harder to stay active and make healthy food choices, creating a cycle that can drive up cardiovascular risk,” says Steele. Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of high cholesterol, with studies finding higher HDL and lower LDL levels in people who exercise regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If a lack of sleep is interfering with your ability to stay active, then it’s time to prioritize getting to bed earlier.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you struggle to get to bed at a reasonable hour or have trouble staying asleep, there are several things you can do to help. If changes to your bedtime routine don’t help, it could be time to talk to your doctor about your sleep habits and concerns. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many, one of the best parts about the weekend is getting to sleep in. However, this shift in your schedule could be the reason why you’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;not sleeping well&lt;/a&gt; the rest of the week. Steele recommends sticking to a consistent sleep/wake schedule—yes, even on the weekends. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The body’s circadian rhythm responds well to consistency and predictability because it acts like an internal clock. During certain times of the day, the internal clock turns on and off hormones related to sleep and wake cycles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A consistent schedule allows your circadian rhythm to function well and support deep sleep overnight and wakefulness during the day. “Getting up at the same time every day and getting natural sunlight on your face helps to produce melatonin early enough at night to allow you to wind down and feel sleepy at night,” says&lt;a href="https://www.focusednutritionandwellness.com/aboutme" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Dani Felber, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a mental health registered dietitian.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Take a Walk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Combining natural light exposure with physical activity is a great way to promote better sleep. “Go for a 10- to 15-minute walk outside after lunch. The physical activity and brief exposure to sunlight can help regulate your body’s clock and support better sleep,” says Steele. Plus, taking a walk may also help lower stress levels, which can also help improve sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Avoid Large Meals Close to Bedtime &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating too much right before bed can disrupt your sleep. The timing of meals is integral to the circadian rhythm, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053587/habit-you-should-break-for-better-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a large meal close to bedtime&lt;/a&gt; may negatively affect sleep and even your body’s metabolic response to the meal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, eating a large meal less than two hours before bed might not allow your body enough time to digest before lying down, potentially leading to unwanted side effects. “Gastrointestinal symptoms like indigestion and heartburn can make it more difficult to both fall asleep and stay asleep,” says Felber.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Avoid Screens Before Bed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re used to scrolling your phone before bed or typically fall asleep watching a show, it may be time to find a new bedtime habit. Exposure to artificial blue light in the hours before sleep can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it challenging to get restorative sleep. “The blue light from screens interferes with melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep,” says&lt;a href="https://www.integratedgic.com/blog/supriya-rao" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Supriya Rao, M.D., DiplABOM&lt;/a&gt;, managing partner and director of the Metabolic and Lifestyle Medicine Clinic, Integrate Gastroenterology Consultants. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead, she recommends finding a relaxing, screen-free activity to end your day with, like reading a physical book, stretching or meditating. Try putting away the screens at least two hours before bedtime.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting adequate shut-eye each night is just one piece of the puzzle. For lower cholesterol levels, it’s important to prioritize an overall healthy lifestyle. Here are three strategies to help with better cholesterol: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Enough Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;“Fiber can bind to cholesterol, which can help remove it from the body,” says&lt;a href="https://dietitianmo.wordpress.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Moushumi Mukherjee, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. For optimal heart health, try to incorporate a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7957097/carbs-you-should-be-buying-to-lower-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;source of fiber&lt;/a&gt; at every meal and snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “I like to encourage my clients to eat more plants every week—be it a handful of spinach thrown into your spaghetti sauce or smoothie, adding nuts or seeds to a favorite snack, or eating a piece of fruit alongside your morning coffee,” adds Brown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt for Healthy Fats: &lt;/strong&gt;To help lower cholesterol, the American Heart Association recommends choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;unsaturated fats instead of saturated ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Shah agrees, recommending swapping out sources of saturated fat, like palm oil, fried foods and fatty meats, for heart-healthy alternatives, including olive oil, avocado and fatty fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move More: &lt;/strong&gt;Physical activity is especially important for keeping cholesterol levels in check. Regular physical activity increases HDL cholesterol levels while also lowering LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s recommended that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Activity in short bursts or longer duration both have health benefits. The most important thing is to find an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;activity you enjoy&lt;/a&gt; and can do regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough sleep is the foundation for good health. Without it, your body simply isn’t able to function at its best, which could lead to health concerns like insulin resistance or high cholesterol. “Over time, inadequate sleep becomes more than just an energy issue. It’s a setup for chronic disease,” says Steele. To keep your heart healthy, prioritize getting adequate sleep by moving more throughout the day, avoiding screens and large meals before bed and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;br&gt;

But there are many other causes of memory and attention impairment that are unrelated to dementia, but whose symptoms can mimic dementia, such as depression or mood disorders, sleep deprivation, and drug or alcohol intoxication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors can affect our cognition at any stage in life, though many people don’t start worrying about cognitive decline until midlife or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s something we see so frequently, and people care about it so much,” said Dr. Ashwin Kotwal, a geriatrician and palliative care physician at UCSF who studies how social isolation affects cognitive impairment in older adults. “In particular, we see a lot of caregivers and care partners, people in the sandwich generation who see loved ones experience cognitive decline and want to do as much as they can to preserve their own brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to wait until you’re older to lay the groundwork for a healthy brain, doctors and researchers say. There’s a lot you can do throughout life to lower your risk of cognitive decline, and many of those things are tried-and-true habits that boost your overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend exercise, as it has the most data supporting the benefits on the brain,” said Dr. Sharon Sha, a clinical professor of neurology and chief of the memory disorders division at Stanford Medicine. “However, healthy diet, good sleep, socializing and keeping your brain active is important throughout the lifetime as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="embed" data-server-side-rendered="true" class="e1ogmilg x100 f fdc aic mb32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vascular disease, head trauma, pollution and lower education levels increase the risk of dementia, Sha said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of this, it would be important to not only reduce these risk factors but also prevent them from a young age,” she said. “Most research suggests that doing the brain health lifestyle measures are helpful for promoting brain health beyond midlife. However, setting the stage from a young age about the importance of a healthy brain and maintaining a healthy brain may be the best way to prevent problems rather than waiting for a problem to arise.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can do at each stage of life to help improve and preserve brain health, and prevent or slow cognitive decline: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first decade and a half of life, the brain is growing in size, weight and volume — developing connections, neurons and synapses, said Dr. Vivek Rao, chief of neurology at Kaiser Permanente Redwood City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, for children and teens, nutrition and sleep are very important, he said. So are limiting screen time, being creative and reading, and having friends and social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know which one is the most important,” Rao said. “But in aggregate fashion, diet, sleep, making sure they’re actively engaged with other individuals and things that make them curious to learn more, those are extremely important as the brain is growing and developing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Teenage years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, the teenage years are when depression and other mental health conditions can become more prominent, with more recognizable symptoms, Rao said. Some mental health disorders can mimic dementia and cognitive issues. And pressure from academics or sports may trigger stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can mitigate some of those things as early as possible with recognition, getting help, avoiding inactivity, avoiding substances of abuse like tobacco, alcohol and nicotine, and encouraging teenagers to get out and minimize screen time, continue to learn and engage with their education, those are things we’d recommend,” Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown that people with higher levels of formal education may be less likely to develop dementia later in life. It’s not clear exactly why, but it could be that progressing in education “pushes” your brain and helps build a buffer or cognitive reserve that can protect against — or delay — changes in your brain that manifest as dementia years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher education has been linked to the idea of ‘cognitive resilience,’ making it likely to keep promoting brain health from a young age throughout our lifetime,” Sha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Young adulthood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain development starts to slow down as we transition from the teenage years into the 20s, Rao said, but the 20s are a time when many young adults engage in risky behavior. So it’s important to try to minimize the risk of head injury by wearing a helmet, for instance, when skiing, biking and playing football. Head trauma, especially repeated trauma, raises the risk of brain damage and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And start to develop good habits regarding diet and sleep if they haven’t already,” Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be more feasible once you’re out of college and have a more regular work and sleep schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 20, 25-ish, I look at it as holding on to what you have because the amount of brain development thereafter is pretty minimal,” Rao said. “It’s really about maintenance and … keeping it active as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Midlife&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter your 30s, Rao recommends seeing your doctor regularly if you’re not already. Start monitoring your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to try to reduce your risk of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer’s. Vascular dementia is caused not just by acute events like a stroke, which disrupts blood flow to the brain, but also by chronic, progressive small blockages in the smallest blood vessels in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) can slowly damage these blood vessels over time, especially if the conditions are not well controlled and occur over years or decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our vascular health is hugely important to our brain health,” Kotwal said. “As those build up over time, that can cause dementia. So, anything we can do to preserve our cardiovascular health, particularly our vascular health, that can help to reduce our dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Alzheimer’s, which is related to age, genetics and other factors that aren’t totally well understood, vascular dementia “is fairly preventable by being aggressive with risk factor modification,” Rao said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some clinical trials have found that managing blood pressure and cholesterol not only helps people live longer, but also helps preserve people’s cognition longer, Kotwal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, hobbies, social connection and moderating alcohol consumption are also important, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people in their 30s start having children and may not be sleeping well, or are more stressed at work — which can potentially inhibit good brain health, Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to make sure you save time for yourself,” he said. “That could be reading a book, taking a class, going on a run regularly. Whatever is your thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that getting consistent sleep may feel unrealistic with young children, but urges people to try to keep up their hobbies and friendships, as this will help set the tone for the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That will build your habits for your 40s, 50s and 60s,” Rao said. “You’ll keep going with them, which is extremely important in the subsequent decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While diet is important at every age, it’s often in the 40s and 50s that many people start to pay more attention to it because midlife is when high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes become more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you enter your 50s, it’s even more important to stay active,” Rao said. “It’s even more important to focus on your medical issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies show the MIND diet — which combines the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, emphasizing leafy greens, berries, legumes, fish and chicken while minimizing alcohol, cheese and fried foods — may slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing I like about the MIND diet is it’s more practical than going vegan, which is hard for people to do and stick with,” Rao said. “The most important thing is compliance with what you can do, and eventually slowly moving toward the MIND diet. Don’t take it all on at once. Some progress is better than giving up completely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people are interested in the MIND diet, Rao said, it has “low downside and potentially upside not just on cognitive health but for hypertension, diabetes, controlling cholesterol and mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Later life/seniors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for patients in their 70s and 80s to be isolated, lonely and extremely introverted, Rao said. Researchers aren’t sure whether cognitive decline causes people to become less social and thus more lonely and isolated, or whether being less social and more isolated causes or worsens cognitive decline; it could be that both are true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The 60s and beyond, it starts to change more toward some of the softer things, such as staying connected, really focusing on who’s your friend network, how do you engage with them,” Rao said. “How do you keep active with those connections, whether it’s an adult senior center or golf course or playing mahjong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep learning. Have a reason or purpose to get out of bed. Try to walk a little more than you did yesterday,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao also emphasized it’s important at this age to be careful about falls, which can precipitate a brain bleed or broken hip and accelerate a downward spiral in cognitive and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid- and late life, people who are socially active tend to have better cognitive outcomes, said UCSF’s Kotwal. Perhaps hearteningly, that’s one risk factor that people have more control over, compared to other risk factors like exposure to environmental toxins such as pollution and microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socializing “puts a lot of demand on our brains,” he said. “It requires coordination, engagement at an in-depth level. Sometimes you’re required to bridge multiple different social connections if you’re at a party and introducing people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the ‘use it or lose it’ theory,” he said. “You have to use these skills.

People aren’t cooking as much as they used to, and they’re snacking more instead of sitting down to meals.

One of the reasons it’s important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. “But the foods richest in potassium — fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes — aren’t eaten enough as part of the standard American diet,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a68f8e4b0d1cc4a5a853c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is the high sodium content in our diets. “Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren’t getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been “demonized” in some circles, Hernandez said, but they’re great sources of a vital nutrient: “A medium baked potato has 164 calories and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="952 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a68f8e4b0d1cc4a5a853c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;&lt;span&gt;952 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a68f8e4b0d1cc4a5a853c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;422 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods, Not Pills, Will Make A Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days.

If you aren’t already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don’t waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you’re getting enough.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

It’s how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. “We don’t need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 11:00:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPZmV4Q0pFUndwOVlicktYeEdRQ0FuXzE2b2ozc1k4M19pSUY5R1FKOEFISG84XzdLNGZxOFlKRk1ZcjBqRXd2Z3Q3OXdXVVhwUWkyRWhFUmE2UzZoQTI0ZmgxTFFhYlJ2TGJSWU1UWEdiOVdGc1FkeG1zNlhyYVZuTl9rN3B4aWRXSmRXQWhDQktfMV9GMWpGZ1NaUThvLXdFZjV5WXBTLVR5NGxqbENSX2xMZ9IBuAFBVV95cUxPQ0NiYzNXTlh5LVB5dTJWSUxqY3pDNi00WGpmODVEc1c3S3hmVFJMVmtOTVV1YzFzVXh2eHp1ZUFZYXVSeDRvSWFkVkhRaktveXRSeFB5M0RGZnVvdzhkZ3JQVThZQ0xXbmc4TEY3R2dGbVMzcWVsVlZ5T3lBaHRjaDNma0pBZmZnY3RXRTJURU9OM3FLdGFLa1lBRHRWb0hZZ2daZlVlWjVtWEFBRXZrTmF6Uk9ROE1l</guid></item><item><title>医生希望你停止食用人造糖-一项新的研究显示了确切的原因-女性健康 | Doctors Want You To Stop Consuming Artificial Sugar—A New Study Shows Exactly Why - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOdldjTFotVjF2OHhoeXl1a09kSGlwYUNGSUF6ZHhKZm9XbEp0RmxpVkIwM3JLbVd6WmZiWW51WENSV292bGM5WFU5emMzdmp4djNQSFkwT1RwOTFTbUVKR1hQOXlYUVNUcFdvNFZkQklucDBzdm4tNFlldFU5RERaR2U2N2VJbEQyRVZyRE93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If a sugar-free soda or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="low-calorie" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;low-calorie&lt;/a&gt; candy bar seem too good to be true, that's because sometimes, they are.

They discovered that cells that were exposed to the amount of sweetener in one drink serving had higher levels of oxidative stress. (In case you’re not familiar with it, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oxidative stress" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; is an imbalance in the body that can damage cells, lead to aging, and raise the risk of cancer and other diseases.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers also discovered that cells exposed to erythritol produced less nitric oxide, which is a compound that helps blood vessels dilate. Lower levels of nitric oxide can mess with blood flow, make it hard for blood vessels to widen, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“We decided to study erythritol because it is widely marketed and consumed as a ‘safe’ sugar alternative,” says Auburn Berry, lead study author and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. “However, emerging evidence has linked erythritol intake to an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. Despite these associations, the direct biological effects of erythritol on brain endothelial cell function, which is critical for maintaining cerebrovascular health, are poorly understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-erythritol" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;What is erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Erythritol is a low-calorie sugar substitute, explains Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s popular because it doesn’t impact blood glucose and levels of insulin (a hormone that helps escort glucose to your cells to be used for energy) as much as table sugar does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“It's often marketed as a ‘natural’ sugar substitute due to its lower glycemic index and minimal calorie content,” Keatley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While it's widely considered safe in moderation, Keatley says that there's a growing body of research suggesting that it may not be entirely without risk, especially when consumed in larger quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-foods-contain-erythritol" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;What foods contain erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Erythritol is found in a lot of sugar-free products, like energy drinks, some snack foods, and protein bars.

Dysregulated circadian rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up too early could also be a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/circadian-rhythm" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/circadian-rhythm"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; issue, Dr. Kaylor says, which means that your internal clock is misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the most common reasons is changes in our internal clock as we get older. We naturally tend to go to bed a bit earlier and wake up earlier with age, and our sleep also becomes lighter," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eulasclinics.com/team-members/dr-pamela-walters/" data-url="https://eulasclinics.com/team-members/dr-pamela-walters/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Dr Pamela Walters&lt;/a&gt;, an MD and consultant psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another factor is your cortisol rhythm. Cortisol naturally starts to rise in the early hours, and in some people, that rise comes too soon and wakes them," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to these rhythms can impact your sleep drive, which is what dictates how sleepy we feel in the evenings and how long we can sleep for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be that your body’s sleep drive isn't strong enough to push you into another full &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-cycles" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-cycles"&gt;sleep cycle&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Walters explains.

"Make your bedroom an ideal place to sleep," says Dr. Darley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our sleep is very sensitive to light, the sun coming up can wake us. Make your bedroom as dark as a cave for sleep, ideally lighting should be less than 1 lux, and without any blue light," Dr. Darley adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If light pollution is a concern where you live, it's also worth considering &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/blackout-curtains-5-reasons-to-buy-and-4-to-skip" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/blackout-curtains-5-reasons-to-buy-and-4-to-skip"&gt;blackout curtains&lt;/a&gt; or blinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important that you have the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-mattresses" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-mattresses"&gt;best mattress&lt;/a&gt; for your sleep needs, along with the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-pillow" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-pillow"&gt;best pillow&lt;/a&gt;, so you can remain comfortable and supported all night long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, investing in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep-tech/5-gadgets-i-recommend-for-better-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep-tech/5-gadgets-i-recommend-for-better-sleep"&gt;sleep tech&lt;/a&gt;, like ear plugs if you live somewhere noisy can help you to make the most of your bed.

Dietitian Katie Drakeford wrote about the research-backed topic for Yahoo Life this week. She says the best way to maximize your meals is to start with protein before moving on to fiber-rich foods and finishing your meal with a quick-digesting carb. So, if you’re having breakfast, go for eggs first, then berries, followed by toast or a pastry last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating your meals in a specific order can help you keep your blood sugar in check, leaving you energized instead of sluggish. And by saving carbs for last, your body digests food more slowly, which keeps you feeling full longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/snowflake" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:❄️;cpos:37;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;❄️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Set your fridge to this temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re looking to cut back on utility costs, you may want to consider what temperature you’re setting your fridge at.

Not only does it keep us physically fit, but it can also have significant effects on our mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Dr Robert Love has revealed that incorporating a common &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/lifestyle/food-drink"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; into your daily meals could potentially lower the risk of &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/alzheimers-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. In a recent video, he discussed why current research suggests this simple dietary change could be beneficial for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He referenced a study conducted by Dr Lei Feng and his team, which found that individuals who consume mushrooms at least three times a week experienced a "significant reduction" in their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The study even suggested that this habit could decrease the risk by as much as 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Love explained: "That is huge. Now, people are asking 'what kind of mushrooms?' Now the research did not specify, so that means pretty much most mushrooms. If not, all edible mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;"Edible mushrooms are great for your brain. My favorite edible mushroom for the brain is something called lion's mane. Lion's mane is a mushroom that's great for memory, it reduces stress and anxiety, it improves mood, it's good for your gut bacteria and it even helps improve sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Love emphasized that all types of mushrooms are beneficial for brain health, and he recommended a few others as well. While he admitted that white mushrooms are the "least beneficial", he still encourages everyone to incorporate this food into their diet as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there's no foolproof diet against Alzheimer's, a study suggests that mushrooms could play a role in risk reduction. A 2019 study by experts at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS) found that elderly people consuming upwards of two standard portions of mushrooms weekly may cut their chances of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clarity, a single portion amounts to about three-quarters of a cup of cooked mushrooms, averaging 150 grams. Roughly, this equates to half a plate for two portions. Standards aside, the research hinted that even a modest amount of mushrooms each week might significantly lower MCI risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor Lei Feng, from the NUS Department of Psychological Medicine, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.j-alz.com/content/nus-study-eating-mushrooms-may-reduce-risk-cognitive-decline" rel="nofollow"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;: "This correlation is surprising and encouraging. It seems that a commonly available single ingredient could have a dramatic effect on cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What you need to know about Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NHS in the UK: "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include increasing age, a family history of the condition, untreated depression, lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. It's a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over time and become worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually the first signs include minor memory problems such as forgetting about recent conversations or events, or forgetting the names of places and objects. If you are concerned you, or a loved one, may have the illlness it's important to contact your GP for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 08:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcXdEMWw1WWNsN3dpZGEzaUxVNjktc0pla3o4dTA0OUxDRnJaOTRvblIyRm9kYWFQc2F2cXV6MEpaaGstdmJtZGt2WlZ5MUs2UmgyaWt5bE83R2hPWklMQ2RSSEFidWpEcEpvOEJ6XzF5WWVtVFZ2eE40a0FWQzQwanBuLUJkUzBobnRNVk01cE5FRktLM21nX9IBngFBVV95cUxNVTRZLVF2dHJsNTNfcnpGRUtqTksxWjhpcDBSOTcyT3AtNzduek5UN2JLNElMWlhwTnBqVDFSa2ctcXNPMm1wanVJTERFMTZKdUdmRlpNeWsxcVdLTUNjMGg0X0xQanJvNnY5cHZEdGVkci1IYW8wYVJpUlRQTUNCTFo1RkVGUXNEemZHQUpOcEx0dzA4bWFrYThBeTVIdw</guid></item><item><title>路易斯安那州的医生说，生活方式的改变，日常大脑活动可以降低痴呆症的风险- NOLA.com | Lifestyle changes, daily brain activities can reduce dementia risk, Louisiana doctors say - NOLA.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="1"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching someone suddenly struggle to remember simple everyday things is heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person is still physically present, but as their memory declines, personality and sense of self begin to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss and care required takes an enormous toll on families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-right tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-8aed8be3-5446-43f4-acf5-dae74479c868" data-instance="#gallery-items-c259cb4b-0d66-4038-a16e-f4a712ca3f53-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-c259cb4b-0d66-4038-a16e-f4a712ca3f53"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have examined potential causes and risk factors for dementia for years. In 2024, the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care suggested that up to 45% of dementia cases may be prevented by fully addressing 14 lifestyle risk factors including:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;not completing secondary education, resulting in less cognitive reserve,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hearing loss, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;high LDL cholesterol,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;depression, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;traumatic brain injury, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;physical inactivity, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;diabetes, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;smoking, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hypertension, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;obesity, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive alcohol consumption, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;social isolation, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;air pollution, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and untreated visual loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Virginia Kellner, a Lafayette-native and neurologist, emphasizes the point that lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the risk of dementia. Kellner says that up to half of dementia cases could be prevented with these lifestyle modifications addressing the 14 risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Even those with a genetic predisposition to dementia can decrease their risk through healthy choices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prioritizing cognitively stimulating activities throughout life,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;minimizing exposure to harmful noise,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;staying socially active and avoiding isolation;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;addressing vision loss when possible;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;maintaining healthy sleep and stress management habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most critical period for making these changes is midlife, between the ages of 18 and 65, though benefits can still be seen later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cathy Champagne, a lead developer of the DASH diet, said it was a meal plan easy to stick with and works for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is scientifically proven to lower blood pressure, lower the risk of stroke, lower the risk of cardiovascular events and works to improve metabolism regardless of your size," Champagne said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three diets (the MIND, Mediterranean and DASH) highlight plant-based foods and limit the intake of animal and high saturated fat foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that individuals who followed the MIND diet experienced a 53% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-right tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-19d80785-39d5-5983-b13b-631b6106d8e0" data-instance="#gallery-items-c259cb4b-0d66-4038-a16e-f4a712ca3f53-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-c259cb4b-0d66-4038-a16e-f4a712ca3f53"&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a day's worth of eating on the DASH diet, which Pennington Biomedical Research Center helped formulate.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even those who adhered to the diet moderately demonstrated a reduced risk," said Lafayette neurologist, Kellner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet encourages the consumption of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;extra-virgin olive oil (used as primary cooking oil)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;six or more servings per week of green leafy vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;other vegetables (at least one serving per day)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;two or more servings of berries per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;three servings daily of whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;seafood (at least once a week)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;poultry (twice a week)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;beans and legumes (at least four servings a week)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nuts (at least five or more servings per week).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods to avoid with the MIND diet include fried and fatty foods, sweets and pastries, butter and trans-fat margarine, whole-fat cheese and red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The importance of cognitive engagement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although improving diet and exercise will help lower the risk factors involved in dementia and brain aging, people must also work to keep the brain active throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kellner advises that any activity that challenges the brain — such as reading, solving puzzles or learning a new instrument or language — can help build cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Even little things, like memorizing a grocery list instead of relying a digital list on the phone, can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeff Keller, the director of the Institute for Dementia Research &amp;amp; Prevention at Pennington Biomedical Research Center and a professor of aging and neurodegeneration, said these little measures to test the mind, go a long way with latter-life brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in Neurology in 2021 found that high levels of cognitive activity, such as reading, playing games like checkers, puzzles and writing letters, can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease by five years among those aged 80 years and over.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Another study from Journal of the American Medical Association Open, published in July 2023, found that frequently engaging in brain-challenging activities, including journaling, playing chess and solving crossword puzzles was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These activities increase the cognitive reserve, or mental library," Keller said. "As new books are added, the library grows bigger and bigger. Building this library of information in your brain creates a buffer for memory loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although keeping the brain active throughout life is essential to reducing the risk of cognitive decline, managing other risk factors (like depression, isolation and environment) must accompany those activities.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;Regular check-ins with a physician can help detect and manage dementia symptoms early, ensuring the best possible care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;/span&gt;
                            
                        
                        &lt;span class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social isolation is a considerable risk factor for dementia, increasing the likelihood of the condition by 27%. Staying socially engaged helps the brain become more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, Kellner recommends community involvement, family gatherings and joining clubs — anything that fosters connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress management is an essential factor, though an indirect one. Chronic stress increases inflammation and cortisol levels, which can contribute to dementia risk by worsening vascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="8"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stress can also lead to depression, which has been linked to increased dementia risk,” Kellner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana residents may also face environmental risks due to air pollution. Matter from industrial processes, vehicle emissions and wildfires has been linked to vascular damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still learning about the direct effects, but minimizing exposure to pollutants is a smart move for long-term brain health,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habits like exercising, reading and eating well can be incorporated at any age. Assessments are available through primary care providers for those concerned about any cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;For younger generations, the best advice is to establish a foundation of good health early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="9"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aim for the highest quality education possible, stay physically and mentally active and care for your overall health,” Kellner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
