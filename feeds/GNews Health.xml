Dogs have also been trained to detect early signs of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1877718X251342485" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499267118308244" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, oncoming &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;epileptic seizures&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30220-8/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;, all from smell alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But not all dogs have what it takes to become a disease detector, and it takes time to train the animals that do. Some scientists say we can replicate the amazing olfactory capabilities of canines, and people like Milne, in the laboratory, perhaps offer the chance to have a simple swab that could be sent off for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Barran, for example, is using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyse sebum (an oily substance produced on people's skin) from Parkinson's patients. Gas chromatography separates the compounds, and mass spectrometry weighs them, allowing you to determine the precise nature of the molecules present.

&lt;p id="6fae2d7d-f175-4f1e-80bc-e4c62a272f71"&gt;​​Hair is an important part of our personal identity, so its loss during cancer treatment can be distressing at an already difficult time. However, this can be a positive sign that chemotherapy is working, and the hair usually grows back after treatment, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" target="_blank" data-url="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Desmond Tobin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatological scientist&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" data-url="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;at University College Dublin's Charles Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair can look different after &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tobin said. "In the vast majority of cases, post-treatment the hair regrows well and similar to the way it was before," he told Live Science. "But in the early stages of recovery, the hair texture and appearance may change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="6fae2d7d-f175-4f1e-80bc-e4c62a272f71-2"&gt;The most commonly reported difference by patients who have completed chemotherapy is "chemo curls" — hair that regrows as curly when it had previously been straight. Usually, this changed hair returns to its original form within about a year, Tobin said. But why does hair grow back differently after chemotherapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="02090f8a-9b67-4db6-9ef4-71b145c2ad81"&gt;To explain "chemo curls," first we need to understand how hair grows normally. Individual human hairs are long fibers of dead skin cells, composed mainly of keratin proteins,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/4461/sunny-y-wong" target="_blank" data-url="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/4461/sunny-y-wong" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sunny Wong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, told Live Science. Each strand is created by a hair follicle — a complex factory of different cell types — which passes through a constant cycle of growth, rest and shedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d7c118b1-4e3d-428d-a168-a2c292f8aa18"&gt;We're born with all of the hair follicles we will ever have, Tobin said. But a mixture of factors — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;genetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition and fluctuating hormone levels during the different stages of life — means that the appearance of hair is constantly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigments control hair color: The production of sex hormones at the onset of puberty causes fair hair to darken, and pigment loss with age &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/why-does-hair-turn-gray" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/why-does-hair-turn-gray"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lightens hair to gray&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or white later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/can-gray-hair-be-reversed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/can-gray-hair-be-reversed"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can gray hair be reversed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the shape of the hair follicles determines the shape — and, therefore, texture — of each fiber, with circular follicles producing straight hair, flattened oval follicles creating coiled hair, and a follicle somewhere in between giving looser waves or curls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-591b7722-97b5-4798-9697-9bbf176a1928" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-chemo-changes-hair-3"&gt;How chemo changes hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="340a83d0-ac5c-4703-af89-e2a23876d0b7"&gt;So what are chemotherapy drugs doing to these hair follicles? &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treatments target rapidly dividing cells so the hair follicles, which also contain stem cells to act as fuel for hair growth, are particularly vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hair follicle is one of the most proliferative and actively dividing tissues in the body, probably second to the bone marrow or gut, so it's preferentially attacked," Tobin said. "That causes the hair follicle to go into a hyper-stress response." Chemotherapy therefore halts the hair cycle, forcing these follicles to expel fibers during the growth stage or shift them into a dormant phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, post-treatment, the stem cells within the individual hair follicles begin to wake up. The cycle gradually starts again, which enables the hair to regrow, but sometimes with a slightly altered appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chemotherapeutic exposure will damage the existing hair follicle and may turn it into an abnormal shape so it produces a fiber of a different shape or length, maybe thinner," Tobin explained. "It depends on how that hair follicle copes with the impact of the drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the effect of chemotherapy on other bodily systems — such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endocrine system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for making hormones — can temporarily alter the production of pigments, leading to a change in hair color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the complexity of factors determining hair's appearance makes it difficult to predict an individual patient's response, in most cases, hair returns to normal as the body processes the remnants of the drug, Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These drugs work by incorporating themselves into replicating &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it takes time for them to elute from the system," Wong explained. "Probably the cells just need to build up over time and the signals [that regulate the hair cycle] just have to return and reconfigure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d19e37ab-db7d-47d9-99a7-f562216fcd55"&gt;The human body is remarkably resilient, and hair follicles damaged by cancer treatments can make a full recovery. Although it can be frustrating to wait for hair to return, experts urge patients to avoid damaging treatments like dyeing or straightening on their new growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hair typically grows a centimeter a month on the scalp, but good nutrition and blood supply will hopefully feed the soil in which those hair follicles are growing and improve its recovery," Tobin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="4bde13ac-cf96-4970-9831-e66b4f8f297b"&gt;Developing a balanced workout routine that targets your whole body can be difficult. If you're looking for a way to simplify your workouts, you could try spitting them into pull and push sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common workout split, particularly for upper-body weight training workouts. But Pilates instructor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/shape_pilates/" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/shape_pilates/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Gemma Folkard&lt;/a&gt; says it's also something you can apply to lower-body workouts, even if you're training without weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="4bde13ac-cf96-4970-9831-e66b4f8f297b-2"&gt;"Push movements include push-ups, squats and shoulder presses," Folkard explains. "They train muscles that extend or straighten joints, like the chest, triceps, quadriceps, and shoulders. These are usually pushing away from the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pull movements include pull-ups, rows and deadlifts. They train muscles that flex or bend joints, like the back, biceps, hamstrings, and rear deltoids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-are-lower-body-pull-exercises-beneficial" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-are-lower-body-pull-exercises-beneficial"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why are lower-body 'pull' exercises beneficial?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="e680bd4c-1547-4d3f-bef8-e31ba7e66996"&gt;Lower-body push movements, like squats and lunges, are workout staples, but there are plenty of benefits to incorporating pull exercises into your leg day routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lower body pull exercises benefit the posterior chain," says Folkard. This includes muscles along the back of your body like the hamstrings, glutes and lower-back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also strengthen the hip flexors, which a lot of people experience weakness in due to excessive sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-3WsiqQPYNd5KdMTiA24zH7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-3WsiqQPYNd5KdMTiA24zH7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know stretching these muscles is helpful, but often ‘tight hip flexors’ can also mean weak, or at least less flexible and dynamic," Folkard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In short, they are underused and therefore other muscles, specifically around the spine will over-act to compensate," she says. "This is often where back pain creeps in, via postural inefficiencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower-body 'pull' exercises could also help with knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anterior pull exercises will also benefit the quadriceps, which are essential for knee stability and basic functions like walking, running and more explosive movements such as jumping and kicking," Folkard says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a-three-move-lower-body-pilates-pull-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-a-three-move-lower-body-pilates-pull-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A three-move lower-body Pilates pull workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="ec4ab726-361c-4ade-ae62-f98d1a0130a8"&gt;Folkard has shared a Pilates-inspired lower-body pull workout that you can try at home, inspired by her post above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need is a resistance band but Folkard says these exercises can also be effective with just your bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-supine-leg-pulls" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-supine-leg-pulls"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supine leg pulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f548dfd-0047-4a0c-a49b-c306218e1446"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;: 5-6 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="bf59f20b-dc5e-489f-b97f-5ed651471668"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back, with your hands by your sides and palms down, and loop the band around your feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a neutral pelvis, draw the legs to table top, so that the knees are directly above the hips and held at a 90° angle, with shins parallel to the floor. Flex the feet and press out slightly into the band to find some tension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extend one leg away as the other knee pulls in. Focus on the pulling in action as you switch legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="51436b29-ba9c-40f1-b8f4-1a10491a8d38"&gt;If you want to make this move more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="ebd517e4-3541-4240-b4f6-dd084ac4d201"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the hands behind the head and lift the chest whilst continuing the movement, as demonstrated in the video above. This recruits more muscle groups and creates a fully integrated exercise for the whole body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-shoulder-bridge-leg-pulls" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shoulder-bridge-leg-pulls"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shoulder bridge leg pulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="yA-EphtGPXs"&gt;

Then, when you’re 50, you would probably need to do 20 burpees for the same response,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He listed how the body also slows down in other ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wgaXtepaXwCtKmYLPrjkf4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wgaXtepaXwCtKmYLPrjkf4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul id="59573746-786a-45db-9229-656e89a82d4c"&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We stop producing as many stem cells from our bone marrow as we age and the stem cells are the precursors for tissue growth, so our ability to grow new tissue decreases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The amount of our blood supply: our cardiovascular systems become less efficient over time due to cholesterol buildup in the vessels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Our assimilation of protein through our digestive tract means that we don't seem to absorb as much protein due to the degradation of the small intestinal wall. So our absorption across the small intestine into our bloodstream of those protein-building blocks means that we're not getting as much into our blood in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“The other problem is that in reality we use our muscles less as we get older, we’re much more active in our teens and 20s than in our 40s and 50s, so they atrophy.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-slow-the-aging-process" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-slow-the-aging-process"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to slow the aging process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="8633b453-1e3d-40c4-95ce-1568f8840083"&gt;But it’s not all doom and gloom, here are his top three movement tips for mitigating all of the above to increase your chances of living a long and healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-strength-training" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-strength-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

It’s difficult to recover from, and even if someone is active beforehand, it can speed up their decline into immobility, disability and eventually death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your risk of this sort of fracture by building and maintaining the hip-protecting muscles mentioned above. “It’s important to start as early as possible to preserve and strengthen those muscles and work against the natural sarcopenia,” says Enayat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home"&gt;beginner strength training routine for home&lt;/a&gt; is one way to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-aerobic-exercise" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-aerobic-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

For some, it might be a light jog, for some it might be a sprint,” says Enayat. Ideally, you want to be in zones two to three for 45 minutes, twice a week, as a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then in zone four, you want to be getting your heart rate up in shorter spells,” he adds. “That might be things like Tabata or HIIT training that you might want to do once or twice a week as well, for a minimum of five minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-stretching-and-breathwork" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-stretching-and-breathwork"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

As you get fitter, you can increase the number of zone 2-3 sessions a week to three or four.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, Los Angeles County recorded the highest COVID levels in its wastewater since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spike, thanks to the new highly contagious “Stratus” variant, comes as students across California return to the classroom, now without a CDC recommendation that they receive updated COVID shots. That change in policy, pushed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been criticized by many public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, mutates often, learning to better transmit itself from person to person and evade immunity created by vaccinations and previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stratus variant, first detected in Asia in January, reached the U.S. in March and became the predominant strain by the end of June. It now accounts for two-thirds of virus variants detected in wastewater in the U.S., &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nationwide COVID positivity rate hit 9% in early August, surpassing the January post-holiday surge, but still below last August’s spike to 18%. Weekly deaths, a metric that lags behind positivity rates, has so far remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFK Jr. announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the CDC had removed the COVID vaccine from its recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secretary argued it was the right move to reverse the Biden administration’s policy, which in 2024, “urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement promptly &lt;a class="link" href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spurred a lawsuit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from a group of leading medical organizations — including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Public Health Assn. — which argued the “baseless and uninformed” decision violated federal law by failing to ground the policy on the recommendation of the scientific committee that looks at immunization practices in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has been &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/covid-19.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;routinely recommending&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; updated COVID vaccinations alongside the typical yearly flu vaccination schedule. In its &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7337e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;update for the fall 2024-spring 2025 season&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it noted that in the previous year, a COVID booster decreased the risk of hospitalization by 44% and death by 23%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel argued the benefit outweighed isolated cases of heart conditions and allergic reactions associated with the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel also acknowledged that booster effectiveness decreases as new COVID strains — for which the boosters were not designed — emerge. Nevertheless, it still felt that most Americans should get booster shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that only about 23% of adults and 13% of children received the 2024-25 COVID booster — even with the vaccine recommendation still in place. That’s compared to roughly half of adults and children who received the updated flu shot in the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 00:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNT210V2NtNktoYWd1UHBwelRVR21KbV9NSVZKejBYbW5iYkpUbi1HZVJUblJSS1hUZkZ0Q2hvbXpFb0MxWjJCbG5hZTJONFJXcGl0OTk2WjA0SEhhQVhMWWxqRWxTdkZ4dW1VQzg3cXJ1SzZnbC1GblctaXdPeHhwelhpY21PTV9PNE1ZRm9TU3FranhQOC05elNxNG1wT3JkbjExandwbHY</guid></item><item><title>无知就是幸福： 65个人分享了他们现在后悔学习的最奇怪的事实-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBjU0RRVWotYi03bHo3VVRrOXVmNzFDZVoyNDdURFlXUWtIRmdjbDVFQVpoaUM3TFVEU1Y5YTVwQkV6UmdaTzdvYVBfcndUUXA2b2xRel9lY1VDaTFOUTlWQW1KOHBKQjNkb3U1VllZclc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p data-block-id="0800ae83-fba0-4076-bbb0-655bd0904b72" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;We all live in the same world, on the same planet, yet there are so many things some of us don't know or don't think about on a daily basis.

They collect intimate data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know what you eat and when.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know what time you go to work, the route you take home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know what you like to watch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know your heart rate, your blood pressure, how fast you walk, how far, and where.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know your favorite shows. They know how you like your coffee and your toast and what temperature you like your home to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know when you're most likely to run your dishwasher, and how often you fill it for a full wash or run a quick rinse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know who your friends are. They know who your family is. They know if you prefer texting over calling. They know when you visit these people, and when and where. They know your shared interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of this is isolated information. This is all contained in a profile that is essentially a digital copy of you. That digital copy is highly valuable currency they use to sell to advertisers. Currency that you agree to giving them through devices you paid a lot of money for (how many hours of work would that have cost you? How many days or months?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And they use this to influence you like to spend your money in a way you believe to be spontaneous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This sounds like a conspiracy. But it's a very real industry with carefully engineered processes. And it's happening all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devices are always "phoning home" which is a real term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish I didn't know because no one cares about corporate surveillance. Everyone only cares about TikTok and Temu and no one gives a d**n about the fact that this technology moves so rapidly that laws have fallen so far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**ETA**: Many people missing the point, so let me clarify that being "boring" doesn't exempt you from manipulation and influence. Actually, a lack of variables in your life makes you easier to predict. What you do and what you don't do are all patterned, trackable data. This is an issue stemming from control. Think about how often you interact with an algorithm. The videos you watch, the articles you click, the images that are presented to you, etc. – if you do not have a strong variety in your reading material, if you do not travel or have new experiences, or if you are not working towards developing new skills or strengthening current ones, then your thought patterns **will** narrow down in a way that will make it easier for someone else to puppet you. Your passive consumption of *the algorithms you are locked into* is perfectly paired with a lack of resistance to its suggestions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being sheltered and connected makes you easier to exploit, which could (for example) prevent friction to things like political radicalization.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mjrsti/whats_the_most_disturbing_fact_you_wish_you_didnt/n7dbgqf/" target="_blank"&gt; catholicsluts &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/laptop-computer-on-glass-top-table-hpjSkU2UYSU" target="_blank"&gt; Carlos Muza &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10054-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9153701"&gt;  &lt;p id="9153701" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/m-T9THJMIIMPM-unsplash-689ae18dd8352__700.jpg" alt="Woman lying on bed in dark room, appearing distressed and deep in thought expressing disturbing facts emotion." title="Woman lying on bed in dark room, appearing distressed and deep in thought expressing disturbing facts emotion."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;That women are more likely to be r***d by their family(husband/brother/father) in their own bed at home than a stranger on the street.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mjrsti/whats_the_most_disturbing_fact_you_wish_you_didnt/n7dxrfo/" target="_blank"&gt; Bananaramolama &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-leaning-on-bed-T9THJMIIMPM" target="_blank"&gt; M. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10054-4/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9153718"&gt;  &lt;p id="9153718" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/debby-hudson-sgdyBq6kheQ-unsplash-689ae56c71e70__700.jpg" alt="Interior of a quiet church with wooden pews and stained glass windows, illustrating disturbing facts shared by people." title="Interior of a quiet church with wooden pews and stained glass windows, illustrating disturbing facts shared by people."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;S*x abuse in the church is 10X worse then they are letting on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my parish there was one priest that was convicted and they are saying the number of boys he molested could be as high as 1000.

I’m not talking BPSD, Lewy body dementia, or delirium. I mean you can have a full blown psychotic episode that develops into schizophrenia for no apparent reason at any age. It’s rare after age 40 but not impossible. There’s a whole specialty field in psychiatry (psychogeriatrics) that see this regularly. I’ve seen many patients who had very late onset schizophrenia (and late onset bipolar too) in their 80s and 90s. Not cognitively impaired, not delirious, no Lewy body disease, no head trauma, no psychoactive d**g use.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1mjrsti/whats_the_most_disturbing_fact_you_wish_you_didnt/n7dhbd6/" target="_blank"&gt; HenjMusic &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-blurry-photo-of-a-man-walking-down-a-street-hCXwqmidMxY" target="_blank"&gt; Mario Heller &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10054-12/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9153736"&gt;  &lt;p id="9153736" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ottr-dan-sUHD8WFjkB0-unsplash-689ae0fe0bc82__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of dark coal pieces piled together, illustrating disturbing facts shared by people about hidden truths." title="Close-up of dark coal pieces piled together, illustrating disturbing facts shared by people about hidden truths."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;We will never run out of coal.

Apparently the guy put a screwdriver in a woman’s mouth and suffocate her and then she would lose oxygen. He would repeatedly give her mouth to mouth. He was trying to essentially k**l her then keep her alive and the way the guy told the story, he was so proud of it.

It comes down to Proximity and Opportunity from multiple studies. Many people reported being happy in their relationship, and loving their partner, and they had an opportunity and took it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We try and act civilized and advanced but we really are primitive f**k monkeys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a LOT of people out there that think they wouldn’t cheat, and don’t actively make effort to do so, or put themselves in situations, but if it arose they would find themselves surprised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biological imperative to reproduce, mutual sexual attraction and chemistry, and extremely powerful things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It creates the paradox of trust. People who genuinely trust their partner fully get cheated on all the time and never know it. You can never know, and the data shows there’s a decent chance if the opportunity and proximity arises. But by asking your partner or having conversations for assurance can come across as mistrusting and offensive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never understood why some get so offended when questioned, which is different from accusing.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;The Ghana Health Service has reported that two Mpox patients are currently admitted, as the disease continues to escalate nationwide. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As of August 14, 2025, Ghana had recorded 37 new cases, bringing the total confirmed infections to 409, with one death documented.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Ghana Health Service, in its recent situational report, reiterated a warning to the public to avoid sharing personal items such as sponges and towels within households.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Western and Western North regions remain the most severely affected hotspots in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, authorities are in the process of procuring Mpox vaccines for those at high risk. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The virus is known to spread primarily through close physical contact with infected individuals. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Citizens are urged to promptly report any rash-related symptoms to their nearest health facility.&lt;br&gt;

This is probably a reflection of how many Americans are taking this class of medications known as GLP-1 inhibitors. Twelve percent of adults in the United States have taken them at some point, according to a 2024 KFF Health Tracking Poll, and prescriptions have soared every year in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This class of medications includes tirzepatide (brand names Zepbound and Mounjaro) and semaglutide (Wegovy and Ozempic), and I know numerous friends and colleagues who take one. They have been lifesavers for many people with Type 2 diabetes or who want to lose weight for medical reasons. As with other medications, like Botox, some thorny social dilemmas have followed: Is it rude to ask if someone is taking one? And what do you say if someone asks you that question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Full disclosure: I was prescribed a GLP-1 for a cluster of medical conditions: prediabetes, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I talked to two physicians who prescribe the meds, two well-known advice columnists and two dozen GLP-1 users for their take on the big etiquette questions on the table. Here’s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Is it okay to ask someone if they’re taking a GLP-1 inhibitor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two years ago, I reconnected with a former colleague who’d lost so much weight I barely recognized him. My first thought was, “Did he have cancer” or “Was something wrong?” Lucky me, he beat me to the punch by confiding that he’d been using Ozempic. While some of those on GLP-1 inhibitors say it doesn’t bother them to be asked, Randy Jones, an author and podcast host, who is currently taking one, told me: “I absolutely don’t think people should be empowered to ask someone about their medications without an invitation to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lizzie Post, the great-great-granddaughter of etiquette guru Emily Post and co-president of the institute that bears her name, agrees, explaining the medications we take and the procedures we undergo are private. “You don’t walk up to a friend and ask if they’re on Botox,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bottom line: Don’t ask, mostly. (And it’s probably a good idea to avoid speculating on social media about celebrities’ mysterious weight loss, too. It’s practically a sport for some people, but that doesn’t make it okay.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I want to show I care. Isn’t that a good reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not really. Context matters, and you may not have all the details to navigate that tricky conversation without being offensive. A friend of mine, a pastor who is in front of a large congregation every Sunday, lost 52 pounds in nine months. She says she’s been asked by just about everybody at one point or another, how she lost weight. While she appreciates the well-wishers who say, “You look great! Do you feel good?” she also would prefer that people didn’t make that big a deal out of it. For example, some people seem compelled to comment on her body every time they see her. “Are you buying a whole new wardrobe?” “You’ve gotten so little.” That gets under her skin because “I don’t like having my body size be the most interesting thing about me in their eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;David Wiss, a registered dietitian nutritionist who is based in Los Angeles and counsels patients on issues of weight and mental health, says he recommends avoiding “body talk” of any kind. “Body sovereignty describes the freedom and autonomy to make choices about your own body and health,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Carolyn Hax, the longtime Washington Post advice columnist, says that if you’re just being nosy, there’s no good way to ask. But if you’ve struggled with weight yourself or know someone well enough to believe you can ask without giving offense, frame your question that way. Otherwise, Hax suggests, “If people look well, look happy, look great in that color, then by all means say that.” But don’t comment on their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bottom line: As I’ve often said, if it’s curiosity that’s driving you, curb it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How should I respond if someone asks me this question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matt Hughes, a town commissioner in Hillsborough, North Carolina, told me he’s hesitant to make the disclosure about using a GLP-1 because “it’s almost as if someone worked less hard to lose the weight,” he said. Even if that’s not your intention, asking people if they are taking a GLP-1 might be mistaken for “Ozempic shaming,” which is when people are criticized or judged for taking a drug to lose weight rather than relying on diet and exercise, even though lifestyle changes don’t work for the vast majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Weight stigma is deeply ingrained and almost unconscious,” said Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She reminded me that GLP-1s are treatments for medical conditions - just like those for high blood pressure, cancer or anything else - which can empower those to reply to intrusive queries by being direct, humorous or just deflecting the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some snappy responses I’ve heard include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- “It’s none of your business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- “I like to keep a little mystery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- “Who wants to know?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- And my personal favorite: “My weight is really not that interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bottom line: It’s no one’s business but your own, and you don’t need to discuss your prescriptions with anyone but your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Are there new rules for dinner parties or sharing a restaurant tab?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who start taking GLP-1s often experience major changes in appetite or have side effects like nausea, which can limit how much they want to eat. Some people find they are less interested in drinking alcohol as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That means in social situations, you may not be able to eat or drink like you have in the past. If you’re dining at a friend’s house and can’t eat as much as you used to, a simple “no, thank you” should suffice - and a considerate host won’t press the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When dining out, there’s the age-old dilemma about splitting the check: “I only had a salad. You had a steak.” Or, “I don’t drink alcohol, and you had three cocktails.” When someone is having smaller portions or fewer courses, splitting a check can be even more difficult. Hax reminds people “to be mindful of fairness and not hide behind expediency to get the ‘sober dieting vegans’ to cover their champagne and lobster.” She also suggests “reading the room,” which means sometimes you can get separate checks, or take half of your meal home, and sometimes you just overpay, for the pleasure of everyone’s company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Post also has some specific strategies, like telling friends you dine with regularly: “Hey guys, I’m eating a lot less these days. Is it okay if I get my own check?” Or offer to use check-sharing apps like Billr or Divvy so that all diners pay what they owe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When I host, I’ve started asking guests not only if they have any food allergies or preferences, but also: “Is there anything else I need to know in preparing dinner?” That allows room for someone to let me know either that they’re on a GLP-1, or simply that they’re only able to eat certain amounts or types of food these days. For that reason, I’m also inclined to serve buffet style, letting everyone decide how much they want on their plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bottom line: Be prepared to communicate your needs ahead of time and don’t pry for details if a friend’s eating habits change. I’ve faced many well-meaning but intrusive questions myself, which is why I smiled when Hax told me: “Too bad there isn’t a GLP-1 for ignorance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/15/ukraine-donbas-fighting-russia-summit-trump/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ukraine scrambles to roll back Russian eastern advance as summit takes place;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ukraine scrambles to roll back Russian eastern advance as summit takes place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/08/14/pfas-forever-chemicals-gore/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Her dogs kept dying, and she got cancer.

The paper was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2025.106257"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Child Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive functions are a set of high-level cognitive processes that support goal-directed behavior, including planning, working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and self-monitoring. These processes help individuals manage their thoughts, emotions, and actions in order to achieve objectives effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In daily life, executive functions are important for organizing tasks, solving problems, making decisions, and adapting to changing circumstances. Strong executive skills help people resist distractions, regulate impulses, and follow through on plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children, these skills play a key role in academic learning, social development, and emotional regulation. Well-developed executive functions help children pay attention in class, remember instructions, and switch between tasks efficiently. Deficits in these abilities are linked to difficulties with behavior, school performance, and peer relationships. Executive functions develop gradually across childhood and adolescence and are shaped by both brain development and life experiences. Early interventions, such as games that engage memory and self-control, may strengthen these abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Alanny Nunes de Santana and her colleagues set out to investigate whether a game-based cognitive intervention could improve executive functioning and math skills in 7- to 10-year-old children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cucca Curiosa is an electronic game developed in C# using Unity 2D. It consists of six different Portuguese-language activities designed to target executive functions. Each mini-game focuses on a specific skill and includes instructions on how the skill can be applied in everyday contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tasks increase in difficulty with repetition, and metacognitive strategies—techniques that encourage players to reflect on their thinking—are embedded throughout the game in the form of tips. These strategies guide players to ask questions, evaluate errors, and monitor their attention and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cucca Curiosa intervention was delivered in five sessions, each lasting up to 26 minutes, with an average duration of 13 minutes per session. The full intervention was completed within one week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 112 children from public schools in northeastern Brazil. There were 28 children at each age (7 through 10), and half of the participants were boys. The children were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. Those in the experimental group completed the Cucca Curiosa training, while those in the control group did not receive any intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after the intervention, all participants completed a battery of tests assessing executive functioning and mathematics performance. These included the NEUPSILIN-Inf neuropsychological battery and the mathematics-focused TEMA test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that the Cucca Curiosa intervention led to short-term improvements in both executive functioning and math performance. Statistical analysis indicated that the gains in executive functioning may have contributed to the observed improvements in math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study provides new evidence that training EFs [executive functions] through the Cucca Curiosa electronic game intervention improves the performance of children aged 7 to 10 years in EF measures, notably WM [working memory], IC [inhibitory control], and CF [cognitive flexibility], and in mathematical activities that include counting, patterns, sequences, composition and decomposition, the four basic arithmetic operations, rational numbers, comparisons of fractions, natural numbers, and percentages. The presented intervention therefore represents a valuable approach to training EFs in typical children, with proven short-term gains,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects of the Cucca Curiosa game on cognitive functioning of 7-10-year-olds. However, it should be noted that children in the experimental group were fully aware of the intervention they are going through and could easily guess what study authors expectations are, while the control group participants were not included in any activities. This leaves room for the results to be a consequence of or at least affected by the Hawthorne effect. The Hawthorne effect is the tendency for people to change their behavior simply because they know they are being observed (for example try harder on cognitive tests).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2025.106257"&gt;Game-based cognitive training and its impact on executive functions and math performance: A randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Alanny Nunes de Santana, Antonio Roazzi, and Alena Pimentel Mello Cabral Nobre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOYWk3NFhDMmJoeGg0cmNqdUdmWXZDSmp6dWFlZ1R1ajFQY0xPeXRJcFlVMjFMa0dsMmptTUV4MV9reW9GRlFrNWxENHEzc3BTY3NPTXlxUHEzYTJmLTg5aHljX3hwWnJLd0M1Nk4yVlpJQ25EcUtIcUFpSnA2STRQM1B5V0xvTzI5WWRFc1pXZGxYU2ZoWk1xZnRnZWgwYkdnZzM4</guid></item><item><title>在大提顿小屋发现的蝙蝠群，可能使数百人暴露于狂犬病中- FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNWVhybUFISjQ0TlFDcnNoUU5OLW9ubWU0dzhkaDJwNUtWYUtfZHptb1JfaC03cG5naWk1MjhKaWVvQ1hKa0JDU1JKdTNZcFB1bmpzdWZMbWQycDk3NklzQk1lWThlZVlPeXF1Yk5iVVpjck5qcFZET1hycEIzVFpCTUt2UdIBiAFBVV95cUxPR25WX0Z0SXVfdmJHUHdyeHFTXzZJZVIyOGVWZ09TTDhQcS1VNzBobmRTUExkWm9vUXZtd3Axb1lVc205bmdZR0wyZXJpY0ZqSDlabjVJd191T19ONElyTHpMUkJub1ZXdmRsUGhuVlJiTWg4LWtWZFlTYm5XVEFlMTB5Y3dkdXZa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;div original-article-post="livenowfox.com/news/bat-colony-rabies-grand-teton-lodge-wyoming-vaccine" class="big-top featured article-ct" data-v-7d0efd03 data-v-7f0a623e&gt;&lt;div class="m featured-img" data-v-7d0efd03&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/08/764/432/gettyimages-1430758489-copy-scaled.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1" alt="" data-v-7d0efd03&gt; &lt;span class="overlay" data-v-7d0efd03&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="info" data-v-7d0efd03&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-7d0efd03&gt;&lt;p data-v-7d0efd03&gt;&lt;span data-v-7d0efd03&gt;FILE - The Grand Teton Mountain Range is viewed from Jackson Lake Lodge on September 27, 2022, at Jackson Lake, Wyoming.

					&lt;p&gt;Standing strength isn’t solely about muscle power; it reveals how easily your body moves throughout the day, avoids injury, and stays balanced. As you grow older, a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-lower-body-strength-exercises-seniors-aging-mobility-independence/" target="_blank"&gt;strong lower body&lt;/a&gt; becomes essential for performing daily tasks like rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and catching yourself from a stumble. That’s why we chatted with an expert to learn four standing &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/7-strength-tests-measure-body-age-fitness-benchmarks/" target="_blank"&gt;strength tests&lt;/a&gt; every person over 45 should master to continue to lead a healthy, independent lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These tests identify weaknesses in strength, endurance, or stability that can increase your risk of falls, slow your movement, and affect your ability to perform everyday tasks,” explains &lt;b&gt;Ben Johnson, DPT&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.fyzical.com/st-george-ut" target="_blank"&gt;FYZICAL Therapy &amp;amp; Balance Centers — St. George&lt;/a&gt;. “Poor results often indicate muscle weakness, joint stiffness, or balance deficits that should be addressed through targeted training.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;If your results are below average, that may signal reduced &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-moves-build-muscle-after-45/"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, decreased joint stability, or early signs of mobility decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The good news — with consistent balance and strength training, most people can significantly improve their scores and lower their risk of injury,” Johnson says. “No matter your starting point, these four tests should indicate where your mobility stands today and where it can be in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 Standing Strength Tests Every Person Over 45 Should Master &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/02/rapm-2025-106577" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that patients with six or more prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to develop signs of mild cognitive impairment within a decade. The association appeared especially pronounced in adults under the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin is a prescription medication originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1993 to treat partial seizures. Over the years, its use has expanded to include the management of chronic pain, particularly nerve-related conditions such as postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. It is commonly viewed as a safer alternative to opioids due to its relatively low potential for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin acts on the nervous system by binding to a specific subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the brain. This mechanism reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and helps diminish the sensation of pain. While the drug is not classified as a controlled substance at the federal level in the United States, its off-label use has grown substantially. Along with this rise in popularity have come growing concerns about its long-term effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gabapentin is a drug that was initially approved to treat seizures,” said study author Nafis B. Eghrari, a 4th-year medical student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. “It has shown promise in treating nerve-related pain, and it has become a popular choice to treat chronic low back pain, despite limited evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, there is a discrepancy on whether taking gabapentin increases a patient’s risk for developing dementia. Moreover, there lacks a strong understanding of how gabapentin impacts cognitive function and whether it contributes to neurodegenerative processes. Previous studies have shown mixed findings on this topic. Thus, we decided to explore this gap in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers carried out a retrospective cohort study using deidentified patient data from TriNetX, a national health research network that includes records from 68 healthcare organizations across the United States. They identified adult patients who had been diagnosed with chronic low back pain or related conditions between 2004 and 2014. These patients were tracked for at least ten years following their initial diagnosis to observe any subsequent development of cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the influence of confounding variables, the researchers excluded patients with a history of conditions known to increase dementia risk, including prior gabapentin use, epilepsy, stroke, and cancer. They also used a method called propensity score matching to ensure that patients who received gabapentin prescriptions were comparable to those who did not in terms of demographics, medical history, and other medications taken for pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After matching, the final sample included 26,416 patients who received six or more gabapentin prescriptions and a matched group of 26,416 patients who did not receive the drug. The average age in both groups was just over 52 years, and a slight majority were female. The researchers tracked whether these individuals received a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment within ten years of their first back pain diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included several subgroup analyses. Patients were divided into younger (ages 18–64) and older (65+) groups, and then further stratified into smaller age ranges. The researchers also compared patients who received 3–11 prescriptions to those who received 12 or more to explore whether the risk increased with more frequent use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that gabapentin use was linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline. Among all adults, those who received six or more prescriptions had a 29% higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia and an 85% higher risk of being diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment compared to those who did not receive the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk was not limited to older adults. In fact, the increase in risk was more pronounced in younger patients. Among individuals between the ages of 18 and 64, those who received gabapentin prescriptions had more than twice the risk of being diagnosed with dementia or cognitive impairment compared to their non-medicated peers. Within that group, the risk was especially elevated for people aged 35 to 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find this relatively higher risk in the non-elderly population,” Eghrari told PsyPost. “These results indicate that gabapentin may have a greater cognitive impact on non-elderly individuals, as elderly individuals are already at risk for neurodegeneration due to their older age. This finding warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanism of how gabapentin may impact cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found evidence that more frequent gabapentin prescriptions were associated with greater risk. Patients who received 12 or more prescriptions were significantly more likely to develop dementia or cognitive impairment than those who received between 3 and 11 prescriptions. This pattern held true across both age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the absolute risk of dementia was relatively low in younger adults, the relative increase in risk among gabapentin users was striking. For example, among patients aged 50 to 64, those with 12 or more prescriptions were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia compared to those with fewer prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin’s potential cognitive side effects have been noted in earlier research, including reports of memory issues, mental fog, and sedation. These effects have been observed in patients with chronic pain, spinal cord injuries, and even in healthy older adults. Some studies suggest that gabapentin may reduce neuroplasticity or interfere with normal signaling in brain regions involved in memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, other studies have suggested the drug may be well tolerated, particularly in patients with epilepsy or agitation related to dementia. The current findings add to an ongoing debate and highlight the need for greater clarity about the drug’s long-term cognitive effects, particularly outside of its original use in seizure treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the stronger association seen in younger patients could be due to the fact that older adults already face a higher baseline risk for neurodegenerative disorders, making relative changes harder to detect. It is also possible that age-related differences in how the body metabolizes gabapentin may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of clinical significance, I recommend that physicians prescribing gabapentin for chronic pain perform cognitive exams on a regular basis when seeing patients,” Eghrari said. “I’d also advise patients who are taking this drug to alert their physician if they notice any cognitive deficits, including confusion, poor memory, or slowed thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study included a large sample and attempted to control for a wide range of confounding factors, it remains observational. This means it cannot prove that gabapentin caused dementia or cognitive impairment. Other unmeasured variables could have influenced the results, such as dosage, duration of treatment, or severity of underlying pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could build on this work by exploring the biological mechanisms that might link gabapentin use to changes in brain function. Experimental studies in animals or long-term clinical trials in humans may help clarify whether gabapentin contributes directly to neurodegeneration or whether the observed associations reflect other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway of this study is that patients prescribed gabapentin for chronic back pain should be closely monitored by their physician for cognitive decline,” Eghrari said. “Moreover, gabapentin should be prescribed with caution due to the associated risk of dementia/cognitive impairment. We hope to carry this research forward and explore whether there is a true causative relationship between gabapentin and cognitive impairment. We also plan to investigate the underlying mechanisms of how the drug may impact cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Risk of dementia following gabapentin prescription in chronic low back pain patients&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Nafis B Eghrari, Isabella H Yazji, Bryan Yavari, Gustaf M.

Sensitivity was defined as a heightened responsiveness to environmental and emotional cues, making people more vulnerable but also more receptive to positive experiences and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that sensitivity should be recognized in clinical practice, allowing treatments like mindfulness and relaxation techniques to be tailored for these individuals. With around 31% of the population considered highly sensitive, the findings highlight both the risks and therapeutic opportunities associated with this personality trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Highly sensitive individuals show higher rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and related disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-Edged Trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Sensitivity increases vulnerability to stress but also enhances responsiveness to positive therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Tailored interventions like mindfulness and relaxation may be especially effective for sensitive people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Queen Mary University London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The meta-analysis of 33 studies, the first of its kind, looked at the relationship between sensitivity and common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found there was a significant, positive relationship between the two, concluding that highly sensitive people are more likely to experience depression and anxiety compared to those who are less sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, sensitivity was defined as a personality trait that reflects people’s capacity to perceive and process environmental stimuli such as bright lights, subtle changes in the environment and other peoples’ moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often overlooked in mental health studies and clinical practice, which tend to focus on neuroticism and its association with mental health conditions, this research shows that understanding a person’s sensitivity level is important and can have therapeutic implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people with more sensitive personality traits may be more likely to benefit from treatment plans which involve techniques such as applied relaxation and mindfulness, which can also prevent relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Falkenstein, a psychotherapist and a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the most extensive systematic review on sensitivity and mental health in adolescents and adults to date, and is the first ever meta-analysis on the topic to estimate the impact of this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found positive and moderate correlations between sensitivity and various mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia and avoidant personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that sensitivity should be considered more in clinical practice which could be used to improve diagnosis of conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, our findings could help improve treatment for these individuals. Around 31% of the general population are considered highly sensitive, and, as our findings show, are more likely to respond better to some psychological interventions than less sensitive individuals. Therefore, sensitivity should be considered when thinking about treatment plans for mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work shows it is crucial that the awareness of sensitivity is improved among mental health care professionals, so clinicians and practitioners can recognise the trait in their patients, and tailor treatment to their sensitivity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Pluess, Professor in Developmental Psychology at University of Surrey and Visiting Professor at Queen Mary University of London said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first meta-analysis providing robust evidence that highly sensitive people are more prone to common mental health problems. However, it is important to remember that highly sensitive people are also more responsive to positive experiences, including psychological treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results provide further evidence that sensitive people are more affected by both negative and positive experiences and that the quality of their environment is particularly important for their well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review and meta analysis of 33 studies was carried out by an academic team from several universities including Queen Mary University and the University of Surrey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5a9eba2b7a4b3a0b685b4a8b0a9eba4a6ebb0ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lucia Graves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://qmul.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Queen Mary University London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lucia Graves – Queen Mary University London&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21677026251348428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Relationship Between Environmental Sensitivity and Common Mental-Health Problems in Adolescents and Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Tom Falkenstein et al. &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Relationship Between Environmental Sensitivity and Common Mental-Health Problems in Adolescents and Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental sensitivity is a personality trait reflecting individual differences in response to environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the link between common personality traits and psychopathology is well established, trait sensitivity is often overlooked despite its association with mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we systematically reviewed literature on sensitivity and mental-health outcomes and conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the relationship of sensitivity with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review included 33 studies (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 12,697; 62.51% female; age: &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 25.35 years) and revealed positive correlations between sensitivity and depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, and social phobia; correlations ranged from &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .05 to &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall effect size was substantial for depression (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [.30, .42], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) and anxiety (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .39, 95% CI = [.34, .44], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings confirm a robust association with mental health, and we explore its potential to inform treatment and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 16:03:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9vRE95SDZzRUNnbG5IcUt0NGNMX2hvZl83akNUVmoya0RkbDhuRzZBNnBOZDI1eHFMR3BKLUpUYWFid2JBdmN1MFJLZUVubGJNQmtKc3lTb2RxYWhTOUdlb2F3NXNwMURtZzBZMGJR</guid></item><item><title>10种有助于在一个月内将身体脂肪降低2 ％的食物-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTE9jQnZVQjhZaW5pelIyeGtOQ2ZiVDByVWFqd3BSUjIydUlnT2JsTW1wQ21pdm4xRUdPVlZOeEZ1eEpYRmtfUWkzWDczb25peHpDTUdfS3BlMHpmc2pmYlJnag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;It takes more than working out to achieve weight loss. While hitting the gym does push you closer to your wellness goals, quality sleep, stress management and a healthy diet with nutrient-dense foods all support fat burn. Also including certain foods that naturally lower body fat and being consistent is key. “The right foods help you feel satisfied, keep blood sugar stable, and signal your body to burn fat instead of storing it,” says &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/terry-tateossian/" target="_blank"&gt;Terry Tateossian&lt;/a&gt;, an ISSA Nutritionist and ISSA Personal Trainer, IIN Hormone Specialist, IIN Emotional Eating Coach, and the Founder of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.thehouseofrose.com/womens-wellness-retreats/" target="_blank"&gt;THOR: The House of Rose&lt;/a&gt;. “Build your meals around protein and fiber, and pair them with healthy fats so you stay full and energized,” she says.  “When your blood sugar stays steady, your body is far more likely to tap into fat stores for energy instead of running on a constant sugar rollercoaster.” Tateossian explains, “Build every plate around protein (I coach most women to aim for approx. 1g per pound of goal body weight), add fiber‑rich plants, then layer in healthy fats for satisfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s 10 foods to incorporate into your diet that aid in fat burning with results in a month, per Tateossian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how you love to eat eggs, they’re delicious and a great source of protein that helps with reducing body fat, according to Tateossian. “Eggs are a perfect fat‑loss anchor because they’re rich in high‑quality protein and leucine, the amino acid that flips on muscle protein synthesis,” she says. “Starting the day with  two to three eggs steadies blood sugar, blunts ghrelin (your “I’m hungry” hormone), and boosts the thermic effect of food so you burn more calories digesting protein than you would from carbs or fat.” She adds, “The choline in yolks also supports liver function and fat metabolism, which matters when you’re trying to mobilize stored fat without feeling depleted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild salmon or sardines/mackerel is loaded with protein and omega-3’s, which are vital to a healthy diet. “Omega‑3s (EPA/DHA) lower systemic inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity so your body is more likely to burn fat instead of storing it,” says Tateossian. She explains, “Salmon also delivers 20–25g of protein per 3–4 oz, helping you preserve lean mass during a calorie deficit. Bonus: vitamin D and selenium support thyroid function, which is your metabolic pace‑setter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsweetened Greek yogurt is full of nutritional benefits including lowering body fat, per Tateossian. “One cup packs approx. 15–20g protein, and because much of it is casein, it digests slowly to keep you full for hours and reduce snack attacks,” she explains. “The fermentation supports a healthier gut microbiome (think natural, better GLP‑1 signaling and appetite control) while calcium plays a supportive role in fat metabolism,” Tateossian says. “Choose plain, add berries and cinnamon, and you’ve got a high‑satiety meal or snack that won’t spike glucose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens and crucifers such as spinach, arugula, broccoli, Brussels sprouts are healthy and delicious, but also help with weight loss. “These are high‑volume, low‑calorie foods that physically fill your stomach, slow gastric emptying, and help you feel satisfied on fewer calories,” says Tateossian. “They’re rich in potassium and magnesium (great for insulin sensitivity and muscle function) and cruciferous veggies provide sulforaphane and indole‑3‑carbinol, compounds that support estrogen metabolism, a huge win in perimenopause/post‑menopause.” She adds, “More fiber also means steadier blood sugar and fewer cravings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re craving sweets, berries satisfy your hankering and can lower body fat. “Berries offer sweetness with a fraction of the sugar and a big dose of fiber and polyphenols (anthocyanins) that help modulate insulin response,” Tateossian says. “They’re my go‑to dessert swap: you satisfy the sweet tooth, feed your gut microbes, and avoid the post‑sugar crash that sends you back to the pantry 30 minutes later. Add them to yogurt or a protein smoothie to upgrade satiety.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lentils and beans are an easy way to boost your protein intake and help with wellness goals. “Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans combine plant protein with soluble fiber and resistant starch, superstars for blunting post‑meal glucose and keeping you full,” says Tateossian. She explains, “That combination improves insulin sensitivity over time and naturally helps you eat fewer calories without white‑knuckling it. They’re also mineral‑dense (iron, magnesium), budget‑friendly, and easy to batch‑cook for fast meals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avocado is a versatile food that is packed with healthy benefits. According to Tateossian, “A half avocado brings approx. 7–10g of fiber plus monounsaturated fats that support insulin sensitivity and steady energy.” She explains, “Fat and fiber slow digestion so you stay satisfied longer, which quietly reduces grazing and late‑night snacking.” Tateossian adds, “Avocado also helps you absorb fat‑soluble vitamins from those leafy greens, another indirect boost to metabolic health.

&lt;p&gt;Eating lean and unbreaded chicken or turkey breast is another way to drop body fat, per Tateossian. “Lean poultry is highly thermogenic (your body literally expends more energy breaking it down) and it’s rich in leucine to protect muscle while you’re leaning out,” she says. “Keeping or growing muscle is the #1 lever for a higher resting metabolism, especially after 40.” Tateossian adds, “Pre‑cook a few portions, slice, and add to salads, bowls, or high‑protein pasta so hitting your daily protein target is a no‑brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known for its unique taste and nutritional benefits, green tea or matcha can help with weight loss. “Green tea catechins, especially EGCG, work synergistically with a little caffeine to increase fat oxidation, particularly around workouts,” says Tateossian. “I like it pre‑cardio because it boosts focus and endurance without the sugar surge of many energy drinks.” She says to “Aim for 2-3 cups daily or use a green tea extract with approx. 200–300 mg EGCG; if caffeine sensitive, keep it earlier in the day and reduce intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are tiny, yet powerful. According to Tateossian, “chia forms a gel in the stomach that slows carb absorption, flattens the glucose curve, and keeps you full.” She explains, “You also get plant omega‑3s (ALA) and a few grams of protein, which together support anti‑inflammatory pathways and steady energy.” She adds, “Stir 1–2 tablespoons into yogurt, smoothies, or make chia pudding as an easy, low‑sugar breakfast that actually sticks with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

And if that doesn't help steer the ratings back in the right direction, I don't know what will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Busch, the wife of two-time champ Kyle Busch, is an OutKick star – for obvious reasons. She's hot. She pumps out fire Instagram #content. She doesn't &lt;a href="https://www.outkick.com/culture/nascar-wife-samantha-busch-is-not-removing-her-breast-implants-as-part-of-a-wellness-journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beat around the bush,&lt;/a&gt; pun of course intended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also recently started her own podcast, aptly titled &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhmEp1YwN78" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Certified Oversharer. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sam has a variety of guests each week, from doctors, to fellow NASCAR WAGs. It ain't &lt;i&gt;New Heights. &lt;/i&gt;It's better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Busch welcomed in Dr. Marley Quinn to discuss anything and everything under the sun. Raw milk. Hormone health. Parasite cleanses. You know, typical MAHA stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 20 minutes in, however, the conversation took a turn not even the wife of two-time NASCAR champ could handle: dream orgasms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just like that, suburban moms across America were intrigued:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Samantha Busch has NASCAR wives on edge &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew?! This is what MAHA moms have been hiding from the world. This is why they hate western medicine. Samantha Busch is out here spilling dirty little secrets, and now the holistic industry is about to explode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how you take down Big Pharma, boys and girls. You find an all-natural supplement that gives you mid-sleep orgasms, and it's game over. Wave the white flag. It's donezo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love the look on Sam's face here, too. She's all in. Kyle Busch hasn't won a race in nearly three years. Don't be surprised if that ends here pretty soon. Happy wife, happy life. Looks like Sam is about to dive into the world of dream orgasms, and I think Richard Childress Racing will be the biggest beneficiary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's great news for Kyle, too. He needs a win over these next two races to get into the playoffs. The fellas are in Richmond tonight, and then Daytona next week. He's got two races to figure it out. Something tells me he will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a hunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for anyone interested, here's Sam's full conversation with Dr. Marley. The &lt;i&gt;Big O show &lt;/i&gt;starts around the 25-minute mark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OutKick</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 15:39:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPQ09mMDc4VWNxSGZUQUxreXpua0tLQnBlMEc3WThuOV9nc1I1LWNlVWZJbG5Vc1NOVzl3NVp6WWM2dW9xaExkV1MyVDNwMnJmOTdSZGJfTGZ6aVNCSzdkWi1IUWJfV0E3bGMzQ1dVSklsOFExN0JBTFhzQnV1YUtzZjVmTmxEWGQ5Tm43MjVGYw</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的副作用男性服用“黄金标准”药物-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOdmJaNXljemd0MDI2MXlPc3EzMl9UUnMwTDlEUGtPOUM4QWdfR282TmczdE1WdWdkT3gzNU9vekhQNG5IZUZRd3QzZGVBdGVqSE92SklmdXgzRDR2cW5FSFB1YjVyT0ZLeHk4anFIZDZqVlFfajJwcHJEX0o4ZndDZGkya251Q3ZGX2xQTU1oMWRPTnl2OVY5WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millions of people use it worldwide but an increasing number are now coming forward to talk about the disturbing side effects of Accutane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commonly prescribed for acne, the medication works by significantly reducing oil (sebum) production in the skin, preventing clogged pores, and decreasing inflammation and bacteria associated with breakouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dry skin, lips and eyes, as well as nosebleeds are listed as some of the common side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew, a teenager from Australia - who does not give his last name - says being on the medication, known generically as isotretinoin, left him with an array of problems that are less commonly talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was put on a cream form of the medication at the age of 15 in 2023 to treat acne, but within several months he noticed a difference in his mood. Then other health issues started creeping in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of his complaints, which were originally dismissed by his doctor, included sexual dysfunction, constant fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome and severe &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-05e27c10-7957-11f0-9672-57461caa68a2" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew said he was warned about some of the side effects beforehand including&lt;span&gt; suicidal ideation, dry skin and dry eyes, but he wasn't aware that testosterone &lt;/span&gt;disruption, erectile dysfunction or irritable bowel syndrome could be other possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he told his doctor about his mood changes, the physician simply recommended anti-depressants and suggested the other symptoms could be related to depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Former FDA Medical Officer Dr Josef Witt-Doerring (pictured) interviewed Matthew about his harrowing experience with Accutane &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matthew - who does not give his last name - says being on Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, left him with an array of problems which are less commonly talked about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a YouTube interview with former FDA Medical Officer Dr Josef Witt-Doerring, Matthew explained: 'I experienced fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and a psychological change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then, I slowly began to struggle in the gym around mid-2023 when I was 16. I just became even more fatigued and couldn't put on any muscle or any gains in sprinting or the gym despite working out consistently, eating perfectly, sleeping on time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'That was when I started to have suspicions that my testosterone was affected. And that that was honestly what led me to start researching Accutane and finding out more about it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew found 'hundreds of posts' online from men talking about how Accutane had impacted their testosterone levels and made them depressed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew then had his testosterone levels tested and he got a result of 390 ng/dL, which is generally considered low for adult men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the 'normal' range is often cited as 300-1200 ng/dL, many experts consider levels below 400 ng/dL to be in the low range, especially for younger men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned about his health, Matthew decided to quit Accutane and he quickly found his symptoms dissipated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had his hormone levels retested a year later and his testosterone was at 600 ng/dL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Accutane, also known by its generic name isotretinoin, was first licensed in 1983 and is regarded as the gold-standard treatment for severe acne that has failed to respond to other medicines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Currently taken by more than one million patients in the US, Accutane works by preventing the skin from producing oils that acne-causing bacteria feed on (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew said: 'I was working at McDonald's [at the time], you know, a greasy place, late at night. I was eating a lot of processed food with a lot of protein in it... like protein bars, protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And when I went to see my doctor about my acne, he never asked me about any of those things. How was my lifestyle? What was I eating? He put me straight on that cream.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, two specialists now have to sign a prescription before isotretinoin can be given to anyone under 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The change, which came into play in 2024, was introduced after it emerged the drug's debilitating side effects may have led to the suicides of several young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some advocates are even pushing for the drug to be banned, including one father of a young patient who died by suicide in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jonathan Medland, 67, from Barnstaple, lost his son Jon to suicide in 2004 shortly after he stopped taking isotretinoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medland claims the drug contributed to the 22-year-old medical student's death and said his son had never shown signs of depression before the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also accuses doctors of doling the drug out 'like Smarties because it's an easy fix'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Isotretinoin was first licensed in the 80s and is still regarded as the gold-standard treatment for severe acne that has failed to respond to other medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently taken by more than 1 million patients in the US, it works by preventing the skin from producing oils that acne-causing bacteria feed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jon Medland, a 22 year old medical student whose family blame his suicide on the drug isotretinoin he was taking for acne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medland's father also accuses doctors of doling the drug out 'like Smarties because it's an easy fix'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest patients' skin clears up after just four months and the majority are virtually 'cured'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the drug can be prescribed only by dermatologists due to its potential side effects. The most common include dry skin, rashes, headaches and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew said he saw his dermatologist only twice while he was taking Accutane for 12 months and she encouraged him to continue the treatment plan, despite him voicing his concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, patients must also be monitored with regular blood tests, because in rare cases the medication can damage the liver, and women are advised not to conceive while on the drug due to possible birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 1982 and 2000 the FDA received reports of 394 cases of depression, and 37 suicides occurring in patients exposed to isotretinoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the fifth most common drug reported to the US Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) in association with depression, and the 10th most common (and the only non-psychotropic drug) in suicide reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 14:52:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOdmJaNXljemd0MDI2MXlPc3EzMl9UUnMwTDlEUGtPOUM4QWdfR282TmczdE1WdWdkT3gzNU9vekhQNG5IZUZRd3QzZGVBdGVqSE92SklmdXgzRDR2cW5FSFB1YjVyT0ZLeHk4anFIZDZqVlFfajJwcHJEX0o4ZndDZGkya251Q3ZGX2xQTU1oMWRPTnl2OVY5WQ</guid></item><item><title>研究人员确定了将社会经济地位与儿童阅读技能联系起来的关键途径- PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQRFV6NlNiM2ZUNmxPc3k5bGw4eERuaktvN2phYU1KMzJyWmJPbjVndW40VUNqUFFuUjBwV2x0XzlFMjRadk9hWDJFZFNTMWwtSkV1RVpHTDhVUjgtaDlHeTNGUDF1Mmt4Wi1NOWI1N2hSTkFHS0FsQ3VMNE8wQm5YS3B6TUJPQzBaVWZWUktiYWhJU0NERVlMS1dMWkx1R3h4RFlvdDQ0V1J2T2x1TUp4TWlrQnhsT0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children from families with higher parental education tend to develop stronger reading skills — and a new study suggests this link can be largely explained by differences in oral language skills rather than structural differences in the brain. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2025.101561" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, provide evidence that language exposure and vocabulary development may serve as the most influential bridge between socioeconomic background and reading success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long known that children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds often outperform their peers in reading. This trend is especially clear when socioeconomic status is measured through parental education, a common and stable indicator. While previous studies have shown that lower parental education tends to coincide with weaker reading skills and reduced brain connectivity in reading-related pathways, the mechanisms linking these factors have remained uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study set out to clarify these relationships by testing whether white matter integrity — a measure of brain connectivity — plays a direct or indirect role in explaining why socioeconomic status is associated with reading performance. The researchers also examined how various oral language skills might mediate this connection. Their goal was to determine whether brain structure, language ability, or both help explain how socioeconomic background influences reading outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reading is a pivotal skill to have in our society; it affects our educational attainment, which can influence our employment, and consequently our resources and quality of life,” said study author Martina Villa, a graduate student at the University of Connecticut. “It is important to understand how we develop reading abilities and what the ingredients are to successfully develop these skills. Previous studies have done a terrific job at identifying environmental influences and neural contributions. It is now our job to understand how these different aspects interrelate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from the Healthy Brain Network, a large-scale biobank of children and adolescents aged 6 to 15. After applying exclusion criteria, the final sample included over 3,000 participants, with more than 800 of them having complete data on brain imaging, language skills, and reading assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a series of standardized assessments designed to measure different aspects of language and reading ability. One key area was phonological awareness, which refers to a child’s ability to recognize and manipulate the sounds in spoken language. This includes skills such as blending individual sounds together to form a word or identifying what a word would sound like if one of its sounds were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary was another focus of testing. In this context, vocabulary refers to the number of words a child understands and can define. A richer vocabulary tends to support stronger reading comprehension because children who know more words can more easily make sense of what they read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured reading fluency, which captures how quickly and accurately a child can read written words. This included tests that asked children to read lists of both real words and pronounceable made-up words within a limited amount of time. The ability to quickly decode unfamiliar words is often used as an indicator of reading skill, which encompasses a child’s overall capacity to recognize, decode, and make meaning from written language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, phonological awareness and vocabulary were treated as components of oral language — a broader category that includes all aspects of spoken language ability, such as recognizing sounds, understanding words, and using language effectively. Oral language development typically begins well before formal reading instruction and is known to play a key role in learning to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how these variables interacted, the researchers used structural equation modeling, a statistical method that allows for the simultaneous testing of complex relationships among multiple variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that socioeconomic status predicted reading skill, but the pathway linking these two factors ran through oral language, not brain structure. Children with more highly educated parents tended to have stronger phonological awareness and larger vocabularies, and those language abilities were in turn strongly linked to better reading performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, white matter integrity did not appear to play a meaningful role in explaining the association between socioeconomic status and reading. While higher parental education was associated with slightly higher white matter integrity in some tracts, those differences did not predict reading ability. In other words, the structural properties of these brain pathways did not mediate the connection between socioeconomic status and reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were surprised by the lack of a strong relationship between white matter and reading skill. “Prior evidence for the tracts that we selected is quite robust, and I thought we would replicate those findings, even with a larger and more diverse sample,” Villa told PsyPost. “I think this goes to show how powerful sampling biases can be when we study small effects, and how careful we should be in generalizing research findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models confirmed that oral language skills acted as reliable mediators. Phonological awareness in particular showed a strong influence on reading. Vocabulary contributed as well, but to a lesser degree. These findings held across all three brain imaging models and remained stable even after adjusting for participant age and brain scan quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In follow-up analyses, the researchers examined whether the link between socioeconomic status and reading changed as children got older. They found no significant evidence that age altered the strength of this relationship, suggesting that the effect of parental education on reading outcomes remained relatively constant from ages 6 to 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the main pathway from socioeconomic status to reading did not appear to involve brain structure, the study did detect small but consistent associations between parental education and white matter integrity in some brain regions. These associations were especially noticeable when using more advanced imaging methods that provided detailed measures of fiber density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one model, higher parental education was associated with greater fiber density in all nine white matter tracts examined. However, these structural differences were not significantly related to reading performance. Only one specific tract—the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus—showed a weak link to reading ability, and even that association did not hold up across all models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that some white matter tracts were linked to oral language skills. For example, in one model, white matter structure in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus predicted vocabulary scores. Another model found that the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with phonological awareness. Still, these associations were relatively modest and did not form part of a broader chain connecting socioeconomic status to reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villa outlined the three main takeaways: “(1) While genetics determines a predisposition for reading proficiency, we shouldn’t neglect the effects of the environment (such as parental education, but not limited to it); (2) Oral language skills (e.g., vocabulary) play an important role in the development of reading skills; and (3) While anatomic connections between key reading areas do not mediate the effects of parental education on reading, that doesn’t imply there aren’t other ways in which they may influence the relationship — for example, these relationships may be set earlier, at a younger age than that of the participants studied here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study benefits from a large and diverse sample, it also has limitations. The data were cross-sectional, meaning all measurements were taken at one point in time. Without longitudinal data, the researchers could not determine whether changes in brain structure or language skills cause improvements in reading—or simply develop alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not explore other potential pathways from socioeconomic status to reading, such as differences in parenting style, school quality, or access to learning resources. These environmental variables might also influence reading development, either directly or indirectly, and could be considered in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers used multiple advanced imaging techniques, white matter integrity remains a complex and indirect measure of brain function. It is possible that more targeted analyses—perhaps involving functional brain activity or higher-resolution scans—could identify other neural features that help explain reading disparities across socioeconomic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation relates to the sample itself. Despite being larger and more diverse than most neuroimaging studies, the sample still skewed toward families with relatively high levels of education.

According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/crn-reveals-survey-data-2022-consumer-survey-dietary-supplements" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Council for Responsible Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (CRN), findings from 2022 reveal that three-quarters (75%) of Americans use nutritional or dietary supplements. The reasons for the same range from "maintaining my health" to "live healthier or adopt healthier habits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While consuming these supplements is not entirely harmful, not every supplement in any amount will be beneficial to your body. Now, Dr Bing, a neurologist, has revealed 3 supplements that can be toxic to your brain and nervous system health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his Instagram account, Dr Bing shared a video on the topic that has garnered 10.7K views and 269 comments.

Low amounts of copper in the body can cause Myeloneuropathy, which is damage to the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, leading to numbness, tingling and trouble walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've seen several cases where people come in with progressive weakness and sensory loss due to copper deficiency from long term zinc overuse," explained Dr Bing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It is present in a lot of supplements like cod liver oil or other liver-based supplements. "Unlike water soluble vitamins, Vitamin A is fat soluble which means it stores in your liver and it can accumulate over time. Too much of this can lead to a condition called Pseudotumor Cerebri, which is increased pressure in the brain that mimics a brain tumour." This can cause headaches, vision problems and even permanent vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

They are recommended for those at risk of Vitamin D deficiency such as infants and those above 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, taking too high doses of Vitamin D can cause calcium to build up in your blood, which can affect the brain, leading to things like confusion, fatigue, depression and sometimes even psychosis," explained the doc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So while these vitamins and minerals are essential for our bodies to function, moderation is key.

While this pucker-inducing beverage may be an acquired taste—think unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1154101/marthas-extra-lemony-lemonade" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lemonade&lt;/a&gt; or unadulterated cranberry juice—its positive powers far outweigh its sour notes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most tart cherry juice sold at your local grocery store is extracted from &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/types-of-cherries-11749855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Montmorency cherries&lt;/a&gt;, a popular variety of sour cherries often preferred for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/336049/sour-cherry-pie" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cherry pies&lt;/a&gt;. The juice is sometimes sold as a concentrate, which has some or all of its water content evaporated, and needs to be reconstituted with water before drinking. And there may be extra ingredients lurking in the liquid. "Always check the label to ensure you're getting 100 percent tart cherry juice without added sugars or fillers," advises Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LD, CLEC, registered dietitian at Nutrition Now Counseling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lack of sleep affects everything from your mood and work performance to your energy level and immune system. Chronic sleep deprivation can wreak greater havoc with your health, increasing the risk of conditions like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While a calming bedtime routine and a cool, dark room can help you nod off, some foods, like a cup of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-herbal-teas-for-sleep-8749723" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt; or warm milk, also contain nutrients that help you ease your way to dreamland, allowing you to experience a deeper, more restorative slumber. Another contender is tart cherry juice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Melatonin: &lt;/strong&gt;Tart Montmorency cherries contain natural melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle, notes Melissa Mroz-Planells, DCN, RDN, and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;: "But it's not just melatonin at work! Tart cherries also contain proanthocyanidins, which may help increase the availability of tryptophan in the body," Manaker adds. Proanthocyanidins are a kind of polyphenol found in several fruit, vegetable, and seed varieties that help protect the body from oxidative stress and neutralize free radicals. Tryptophan, she notes, is essential for producing serotonin and melatonin, which are key hormones that modulate sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Impact on Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As anyone who's spent an evening counting sheep likely knows, sleeplessness takes many forms: There may be endless nights when you can't fall asleep and nights when you can't stay asleep or adjust your sleep cycle. While research is still emerging, Manaker says that tart cherry juice appears to remedy all three situations. "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover-designed study, results showed that tart cherry consumption resulted in a statistically significant increase of time in bed (25 minutes), total sleep time (34 minutes), and sleep efficiency (5–6 percent). Circulating blood melatonin levels were also increased," she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study of people with chronic insomnia, she says, found that tart cherry consumption was linked to staying asleep longer (62 minutes, on average, more) and less interrupted sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; How Much to Drink &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A moderate amount can help foster those forty winks. The recommended dosage is typically around 8 ounces of tart cherry juice in the morning and again 1–2 hours before bedtime, Mroz-Planells says. "That said, results can vary, so it's best to start small and see how your body responds," she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Sour Over Sweet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taste-wise, sweet cherries may have more universal appeal than sour, but on the health benefit front, the tart fruit leads the way. "Sweet cherries have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-antioxidant-fruits-11736165" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and anti-inflammatory compounds but in lower levels than tart cherries," Mroz-Planells says. As to sleep benefits, adds Manaker, the melatonin and anthocyanin content in sweet cherries isn't as potent as its tart counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond slumber, the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds in tart cherry juice can also benefit the body in other profound ways.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Tart cherries are rich in anthocyanins and other antioxidants that have been shown to help reduce exercise-related muscle soreness and recovery and support joint health," Mroz-Planells says. "Some studies suggest benefits for easing arthritis symptoms by lowering inflammation markers in the body."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new research suggests that part of the answer may lie in a surprising organ–brain connection: a feedback loop between the pancreas and the hippocampus that is shaped by circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic islets from people with bipolar disorder, researchers uncovered a distinct cellular abnormality—reduced insulin secretion. This impairment was linked to higher-than-normal expression of the gene RORβ, a known susceptibility factor for bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Modeling the Disorder in Mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how RORβ might bridge metabolic and mood symptoms, the team engineered mice to overexpress the gene specifically in pancreatic β cells. The results were striking: these mice displayed depression-like behaviors during the light phase of the day and mania-like behaviors during the dark phase—mirroring the cyclical mood states seen in bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the cellular level, RORβ overexpression during the light phase suppressed insulin release from pancreatic islets. This was accompanied by heightened activity in the hippocampus, a brain region central to mood regulation, memory, and stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these mood-related effects were not isolated to one time window; the hippocampal hyperactivity seen in the light phase triggered a delayed shift in metabolic function. By the dark phase, insulin release was elevated, hippocampal activity was reduced, and mania-like behaviors emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Pancreas–Hippocampus Feedback Loop&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic pattern revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism: a bidirectional feedback loop in which pancreatic insulin signaling influences hippocampal activity, and changes in hippocampal function feed back to affect pancreatic output. The loop operates on a circadian rhythm, with disruptions in one phase of the cycle setting up altered brain–body interactions in the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that, in bipolar disorder, dysregulation in this pancreas–hippocampus circuit could underlie the alternating mood states—depressive lows and manic highs—by coupling them to shifts in insulin release and neuronal activity. In essence, metabolic and mood symptoms may be two sides of the same biological coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Bipolar Disorder&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study focused on bipolar disorder, the implications extend to a wider range of neuropsychiatric conditions where metabolic changes and mood dysregulation co-occur, such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. It also raises the possibility that targeting pancreatic function could indirectly stabilize brain activity and improve mood symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that RORβ is a circadian regulator, the work also underscores the potential importance of time-of-day effects in both research and treatment. Interventions that align with or correct circadian disruptions—whether through medication timing, light therapy, or dietary patterns—may help normalize the pancreas–hippocampus feedback cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Integrative Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research provides a compelling integrative model for bipolar disorder—one that bridges psychiatry, metabolism, and chronobiology. By linking a specific genetic factor to both pancreatic dysfunction and cyclical hippocampal activity, it reframes bipolar disorder not solely as a brain-based illness but as a whole-body condition in which metabolic and neural systems are deeply intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies will be needed to confirm the pancreas–hippocampus feedback loop in humans and determine whether interventions targeting RORβ or insulin regulation can meaningfully alter mood cycles. If so, this could open a novel therapeutic frontier—one where treating the body may be just as crucial as treating the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and bipolar disorder research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/about-neuroscience-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Editorial Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Editorial Team – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02040-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A pancreas–hippocampus feedback mechanism regulates circadian changes in depression-related behaviors&lt;/a&gt;” by Yao-Nan Liu et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pancreas–hippocampus feedback mechanism regulates circadian changes in depression-related behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders often show metabolic symptoms.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study using a genetically engineered mouse model lacking the Sapap3 gene—previously implicated in compulsive grooming behaviors—offers fresh insight into the brain circuitry and molecular pathways that may drive TTM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work also examines the surprising, sometimes paradoxical, effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on compulsive behaviors and social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sapap3 Knockout Mice Mirror Key Features of TTM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapap3 is a synaptic scaffold protein abundant in the basal ganglia, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a hub for reward and habit regulation. Mice lacking Sapap3 exhibited a constellation of behaviors reminiscent of human TTM: prolonged grooming under stress, increased anxiety-like behavior, and heightened social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female knockout mice groomed for even longer than males, echoing the strong female predominance observed in clinical TTM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed behavioral assays revealed that environmental stress—in this case, aversive bright light—exacerbated these repetitive grooming patterns. In social dominance tests, Sapap3-deficient mice frequently displaced their wild-type counterparts, showing an aggressive, dominant edge under challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dopamine Imbalance and Circuit Hypoactivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To probe the neural basis of these behaviors, the researchers used fiber-optic calcium imaging to monitor NAc activity during grooming. Sapap3 knockout mice showed markedly reduced neuronal calcium peaks compared to controls, indicating lower activity levels in this key reward-processing hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular analysis pointed to a dopamine signaling imbalance: elevated dopamine levels, increased D1 receptor expression, and reduced D2 receptor expression in the NAc. This pattern suggests an overactivation of the “direct” pathway in medium spiny neurons, potentially biasing the brain toward repetitive, reward-seeking motor behaviors. Levels of the transcription factor CREB—known to amplify stress-related responses—were also elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team further identified a disruption in the interaction between SAPAP3 and SHANK3, another postsynaptic scaffold protein. Interestingly, SHANK3 levels rose in knockout mice, possibly as a compensatory mechanism to maintain synaptic stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Oxytocin’s Complex Role&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given oxytocin’s reputation for modulating social behavior and anxiety, the researchers tested its effects in Sapap3 knockout mice. The results were complex: a single dose reduced the number of grooming bouts and lessened aggression, but paradoxically increased the total time spent grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual effect underscores the hormone’s context- and dose-dependent influence on brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for TTM Research and Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study refines our understanding of TTM’s neurobiology by highlighting NAc circuit dysfunction, dopamine receptor imbalance, and synaptic protein interactions as potential drivers of compulsive hair-pulling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises important questions about sex-specific vulnerability, the functional role of SAPAP3–SHANK3 coupling, and whether modulating oxytocin pathways could be therapeutically beneficial—or counterproductive—depending on the treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work’s limitations—including small sample sizes, male-skewed molecular analyses, and the need for chronic treatment studies—leave room for future research. But by integrating behavioral, molecular, and circuit-level findings, it moves the field closer to targeted, biologically informed interventions for TTM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and trichotillomania research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/about-neuroscience-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Editorial Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Editorial Team – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-14076-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploring the nucleus accumbens circuit and oxytocin therapy in a &lt;em&gt;Sapap3&lt;/em&gt; knockout mouse model of trichotillomania&lt;/a&gt;” by Yuan Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the nucleus accumbens circuit and oxytocin therapy in a &lt;em&gt;Sapap3&lt;/em&gt; knockout mouse model of trichotillomania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trichotillomania (TTM), an understudied psychiatric disorder, was investigated using &lt;em&gt;Sapap3&lt;/em&gt; knockout (KO) mice to elucidate nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuit dysfunction and oxytocin’s therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under aversive conditions, KO mice exhibited TTM-like behavioral phenotypes compared to wild-type (WT) controls: elevated anxiety-like behavior (reduced total distance 33328.45 ± 6703.97 mm vs. WT 47787.22 ± 12221.33 mm; decreased standing episodes 34.20 ± 19.41 vs. WT 58.10 ± 15.55; increased immobility duration 175.05 ± 54.46 s vs. WT 90.23 ± 70.22 s, all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), excessive grooming duration (467.43 ± 94.98 s vs. WT 391.62 ± 86.44 s, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and impaired social interaction characterized by elevated aggression (70 ± 10% victory rate in tube-dominance test vs. WT, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging revealed NAc neuronal hypoactivity (peak &lt;em&gt;ΔF/F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;: 2.44 ± 1.67% vs. WT 6.92 ± 2.08%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Molecular analyses revealed: (1) Dopaminergic signaling alterations (increased dopamine: 26.95 ± 2.04 pg/mL vs. WT 22.43 ± 1.85 pg/mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05; D1 receptor up-regulation 1.29-fold and D2 down-regulation 0.89-fold).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Synaptic plasticity disruptions (CREB overexpression: 1.71-fold, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; SHANK upregulation: 1.18-fold, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). (3) SAPAP3-SHANK3 interaction deficits confirmed by immunofluorescence (compensatory SHANK3 up-regulation 1.46-fold).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin effects were paradoxical: acute administration exacerbated total grooming duration (550.45 ± 33.65 s vs. KO baseline 467.43 ± 94.98 s, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) but reduced grooming bouts (50.80 ± 28.20 vs. 95.30 ± 31.92, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and attenuated aggression (victory rate against WT decreased to 65 ± 5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex-stratified analysis revealed enhanced grooming severity in female KO mice (the grooming duration 526.59 ± 25.69 s vs. male KO 408.26 ± 104.33 s, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight NAc circuit dysfunction and complex oxytocin effects in TTM, suggesting therapeutic targets while emphasizing the need for sex-stratified.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 13:02:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBHcDhsaWRqMmZ5Qnpqc0o4OWFiQlJuOFhENTkzYnVHS0J3ekEtT1FleHVqTjdhZVVwQTJYVTA1UUZaMy12ZXl6VEtUclNGNEdqS2p1dW1hanpuZkQ5bGVLejV3dnFUcDJSLVRpM3pFMVFTYVdicVI1OTdPcGNNUjA</guid></item><item><title>列|询问是否有人在服用Ozempic是不礼貌的。原因如下。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNUG0yRGMyUFhjSnlIbWpvS2pxVmFfSHhtUFM0TEFBTWNhQ0tXMmVZTnNrMGxKTl9IMkIzWG9BWjhsX2UyUzdFcXluQ3o0RzM5ejhyMmltZDlSZm1yeUhpdzZOMmZBbGlmX3dGcG9JdWJwX0x6NXRQWjdoaXBpcUs5QjF5RHQtdW1Q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XP5BVY2CJAXBIM24FKEHRSXA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s a new kind of nosy parker on the rise in the United States, a person who thinks it’s fine to blurt out “Are you on Ozempic?” to those they barely know.
