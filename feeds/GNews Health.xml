			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older. But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

They tracked 54 women aged 18 to 40 not using hormone-based contraception and grouped them according to how much exercise they took: inactive (reported not taking part in any form of structured exercise), recreationally active (taking part in at least two hours of structured exercise a week), competing in any sport at club level, and elite (competing in any sport at national or international level).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They then completed cognitive tests and reported their mood and symptoms on the first day of menstruation, two days after the end of menstruation (late follicular phase), the first day ovulation was detected, and between ovulation and menstruation (mid-luteal phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in Sports Medicine – Open, found that women perform best on cognitive tests when they ovulate, with on average participants reacting about 30 milliseconds faster compared with later in their cycle and making fewer mistakes. But for elite athletes, the difference in performance was much more pronounced. On average, their attention and inhibition scores were more than 120 milliseconds faster, and their simple reaction time was 80 milliseconds faster at ovulation than the luteal phase of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Flaminia Ronca, the lead author of the study from UCL Surgery and Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, said: “At an elite level, 80 milliseconds slower reaction times makes a big difference and in a fast-paced sport like rugby, it could put you at greater risk of concussion or serious musculoskeletal injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the other end of the exercise spectrum, the authors also found that compared with active participants (at whatever level), inactive participants had reaction times on average about 70 milliseconds slower and made about three times as many impulsive errors, regardless of cycle phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This difference could determine whether we regain balance after tripping over an obstacle or not, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows the importance of incorporating some form of recreational physical activity into our lives,” Ronca said. “It doesn’t have to be that intense or competitive to make a difference – and crucially, it’s something that we can control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/women" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt; in Sport said: “While it is fascinating to understand the tiny cognitive supercharging that happens the day of ovulation, the most interesting conclusion is around the cognitive benefits of being active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Having the time to register and respond to a risk is the difference between having a fall or righting yourself. For women in wiser life, avoiding falls is especially vital given the huge gendered health inequality around osteoporosis with one in two women over 50 suffering from this, compared to one in nine men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We already knew being active can build bone strength and now we know being active can increase our response times. This report adds a second layer of urgency to get women active and address the tragedy and cost of fragility fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORVdKS09Xem83V0lES2x6X0pZNTdMWktNaEtacFpUT1FmZ21HM2NMRF9idXUtQ2ZRbUJSUkZocnRUSXpqWWZMWHNJN3pBcXhMV2t0bVd3WHdFa2tCbWY5TWFKZ3VCdzVOZUpKaEtXUlRaTGRIWUV3ZGh1bVgxOVg4UGNGMURTbWJZWFQ0SXB5SXJObmpUVVhvcmRoM2Q2Q1VhS1RqdzRn</guid></item><item><title>大自然的狂野：户外的四大健康益处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0yvdjgn5o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;How 20 minutes of nature can boost your health&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A wide, front view angle shot of a family and their dog walking through a woodland forest in Northumberland, Northeastern England during the Covid-19 pandemic." class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Spending just 20 minutes in nature can trigger measurable changes inside your body&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If you've ever felt calmer after a walk in the park or a stroll through the woods, it's not your imagination - it's biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Being outdoors can trigger measurable changes inside your body from lowering stress hormones, easing blood pressure and even improving your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;You don't have to hike for hours to feel these benefits as maximum impact happens after just 20 minutes, so even a lunchtime walk to the park and a sandwich on a bench a few times a week can benefit your body and mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Here are four ways that being among nature can help improve your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;1. You unconsciously relax&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When you see green trees, smell pine and hear gentle rustling leaves or the sound of birdsong, your autonomic nervous system - a network of nerves controlling unconscious processes - responds instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This can happen on a visit to the local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We see changes in the body such as a lowering of blood pressure and heart rate variability so your heart beats slower," says Baroness Kathy Willis, a biodiversity professor at Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44097-3" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;A UK study&lt;/a&gt;, involving nearly 20,000 people, found that those who spent at least a total of 120 minutes every week in greenery were significantly more likely to report good health and higher psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The evidence for the benefits of spending time in nature is compelling enough that some areas have trialled so called green social prescribing connecting people with nature to improve their phsyical and mental health, with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/green-social-prescribing/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;positive impact on happiness and wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;2. Your hormones reboot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Your body's hormonal system also joins in the relaxation act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Willis says that spending time outdoors lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline - the hormones that surge when you're stressed or anxious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A study found that people in a hotel room for three days who were breathing in Hinoki (Japanese cypress) oil saw a big drop in the adrenaline hormone and a big increase in natural killer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Natural killer cells are cells that tackle viruses in the body. The participants in the study still had elevated natural killer cells in their body two weeks after inhaling the smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Essentially nature "calms what needs calming and strengthens what needs strengthening," is how Prof Ming Kuo from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000vy1l" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;summed it up to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A three-day weekend in nature has a huge impact on our virus fighting apparatus and even a month later it can be 24% above baseline." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Studies also show smaller but still persistent effects from shorter periods spent in nature, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;3.

          &lt;p&gt;An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251003112109/cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;October 22 and 23&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with "2025 meeting, TBD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the "official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is tasked with publicly reviewing and evaluating the wealth of safety and efficacy data on vaccines and then offering evidence-based recommendations for their use. Once the committee's recommendations are adopted by the CDC, they set national vaccination standards for children and establish which shots federal programs and private insurance companies are required to fully cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the committee has been stacked with highly esteemed, thoroughly vetted medical experts, who diligently conducted their somewhat esoteric work on immunization policy with little fanfare. That changed when ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary. In June, Kennedy abruptly and unilaterally fired all 17 ACIP members, falsely accusing them of being riddled with conflicts of interest. He then installed his own hand-selected members. With the exception of one advisor—pediatrician and veteran ACIP member Cody Meissner—the members are poorly qualified, have gone through little vetting, and embrace the same anti-vaccine and dangerous fringe ideas as Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corrupted committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Kennedy's advisors have met twice, producing chaotic meetings during which members revealed a clear lack of understanding of the data at hand and the process of setting vaccine recommendations, all while setting policy decisions long sought by anti-vaccine activists. The first meeting, in June, included seven members selected by Kennedy.

			&lt;p&gt;We're constantly told to "eat healthy" – but what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even doctors sometimes struggle to offer clear, practical advice on which specific foods support health, why they work and what real benefits people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research is starting to offer some answers. Along with colleagues, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/"&gt;I have researched&lt;/a&gt; whether a group of plant compounds called flavan-3-ols could help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-study-finds-tea-and-chocolate-may-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;The results suggest&lt;/a&gt; these everyday compounds may have real potential for protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols – sometimes called flavanols or catechins – are natural plant compounds that belong to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/"&gt;flavonoid family&lt;/a&gt;. They're part of what gives plants their colour and helps protect them from sunlight and pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, they show up in some of our most familiar foods: cocoa, green and black tea, grapes, apples and even some berries. That slightly tart or bitter note you taste in dark chocolate or strong tea? That's flavan-3-ols at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in their health effects. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294962/"&gt;In 2022, the Cosmos trial&lt;/a&gt; (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study), which followed over 21,000 people, found that cocoa flavanols, but not multivitamin supplements, reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease by 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study set out to dig even deeper, focusing specifically on their effects on blood pressure and endothelial function (how well blood vessels dilate and respond to blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from 145 randomised controlled trials involving more than 5,200 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies tested a range of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and supplements, including cocoa, tea, grapes, apples and isolated compounds like epicatechin, and measured their effects on two key cardiovascular markers: blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD): a measure of how well the inner lining of blood vessels functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies ranged from short-term (a single dose) to longer-term interventions lasting weeks or months. On average, participants consumed about 586 mg of flavan-3-ols daily; roughly the amount found in two to three cups of tea, one to two servings of dark chocolate, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, or a couple of apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of flavan-3-ols led to an average drop in office blood pressure of 2.8 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 2.0 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people who started with elevated blood pressure or diagnosed hypertension, the benefits were even greater with reductions of up to 6–7 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the effects of some prescription blood pressure medications and could significantly lower the risk of heart attacks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that flavan-3-ols improved endothelial function, with an average 1.7% increase in FMD after sustained intake. This benefit appeared even in participants whose blood pressure was already normal, suggesting these compounds may help protect blood vessels through multiple pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were uncommon and typically mild, usually limited to minor digestive issues, suggesting that adding flavan-3-ol-rich foods to your diet is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits were most pronounced in those with high blood pressure, even people with normal readings saw improvements in vascular function. This suggests flavan-3-ols may help prevent cardiovascular problems before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is one of the major drivers of heart disease worldwide, even at levels that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243231/"&gt;don't qualify as full-blown hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (140/90 mmHg or higher). &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072696#:%7E:text=The%202024%20European%20Society%20of,treat%20depends%20on%20the%20underlying"&gt;Recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology now recognise that even "elevated" blood pressure (120–139 systolic and 70–89 diastolic) carries increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, particularly diet and exercise, are recommended by doctors as first-line strategies. But patients and even healthcare providers often lack clear, specific guidance on which foods truly make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings help fill this gap by showing that boosting flavan-3-ol intake through everyday foods may offer a simple, evidence-based way to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png" alt="Tea in a cup next to berries and chocolate" class="size-full wp-image-167409" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-415x415.png 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating certain foods could help support your heart health. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/elegant-tea-setting-with-strawberries-and-chocolates-31583807/"&gt;İclâl Ağlamaz/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies tested supplements or isolated flavan-3-ol compounds, but these generally showed smaller effects than whole foods like tea or cocoa. This may be because other beneficial compounds in whole foods work together, enhancing absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, it appears both safer and more effective to focus on getting flavan-3-ols from foods rather than high-dose supplements, especially for people taking medications, since interactions are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed suggest that 500–600 mg of flavan-3-ols daily may be enough to see benefits. You could reach this by combining two to three cups of green or black tea, one to two servings (about 56g) of dark chocolate or two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, two to three apples, plus other flavan-3-ol-rich fruits like grapes, pears and berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small daily swaps, then, like trading a sugary snack for an apple and a piece of dark chocolate or adding an extra cup of tea, could gradually improve your heart health over time. Because flavan-3-ol content can vary between foods, monitoring your blood pressure at home may help you see if it's making a difference for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, particularly in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177076" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, where the results were less consistent. We also need to better understand how flavan-3-ols interact with medications and whether even greater benefits can be achieved when combined with other healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is now strong enough to recommend flavan-3-ol-rich foods as part of a heart-healthy diet. As clinicians seek practical, affordable lifestyle strategies for patients, these findings bring us closer to the idea of using food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, flavan-3-ols aren't a magic fix. They won't replace medication for everyone. But combined with other healthy habits, they may offer a meaningful – and delicious – boost to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike many health fads, this isn't about exotic superfoods or expensive powders. It's about foods many of us already enjoy, used a little more intentionally.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256631/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The MMR vaccine, to cite a &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p3085.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;typical example&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/administering-mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;dosage of 0.5 milliliters&lt;/a&gt;, roughly a tenth of a teaspoon.

            “Regarding vaccines: some Amish choose to vaccinate their kids and some do not.

We do not know how its frequency compares to non-Amish.”

The participants joined the study in 1985 and 1986, when they were 18 to 30 years old. They were followed for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The team specifically looked at the participants' adherence to Life's Essential 8, a guideline for heart-healthy habits established by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eight recommendations include eating healthy, getting more physical activity, quitting tobacco, sleeping well, managing weight, and controlling cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers put the participants into one of four categories, based on how well they followed these habits over time. Participants could consistently remain very healthy or less healthy, or their heart-healthy habits might improve or decline over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Results showed that that those whose heart health habits declined from moderate to low over time had a 10 times greater risk for heart attack, stroke or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By comparison, people who maintained moderate heart health habits had twice the risk of heart health problems, and those with steadily poor heart health habits had nearly six times the risk, the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Each 10-point decrease a person experienced in their Life's Essential 8 score during the study's 20-year span increased their heart health risk by 53%, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The main point is that we need to stop and take care of ourselves better earlier in life by addressing our sleep habits, physical activity, BMI [an estimate of body fat based on height and weight] and our lipids in that 18 to 30-year-old range and not waiting until you're 45 to go see a cardiovascular expert or a cardiologist, but seeing them early on in life when you can still make an impact on what is going to come down stream," said &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-gaurav-jerripotula-rao-md-1083957021" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Gaurav Rao;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Gaurav Rao&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Cardiac Cath Lab at Huntington Hospital in New York, who reviewed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, many folks have a problem predicting the future impact of their current life choices, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The general population usually, whether it's just due to lifestyle creep, tends to not realize that those effects can be prolonged and they think they can turn off that switch at some point and start living a healthier life as they get older," Rao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"However, this study itself, the main takeaway that it brings to light is that we are not immune from our earlier decisions with respect to cardiovascular health," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While change later in life can help your health, changes adopted earlier will have a more profound and lasting effect, Rao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The earlier they reverse those patterns, the better their trajectory is when it comes to cardiovascular health, he said. "For example, if they reversed it in their late 20s to early 30s, that is much better than reversing it in their 40s to 50s because usually, cardiovascular disease is cumulative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rao pointed to cholesterol levels as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Having persistently elevated cholesterol for a longer period of time can lead to a higher incidence of coronary disease," Rao said.

These include metals such as iron, zinc, manganese, cobalt and copper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most of these trace elements, decades of research have shown they are genuinely essential for health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is essential for carrying oxygen in your blood, and many proteins – complex molecules that carry out all of the functions necessary for life – require iron to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A deficiency of iron leads to anemia, a condition that results in fatigue, weakness, headaches and brittle nails, among other symptoms. Iron supplements can help reverse these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A panel of experts had previously recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, biochemists have pinpointed exactly how iron helps proteins perform essential chemical reactions, not just for humans but all living organisms. Researchers know not only that iron is essential but also why it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the same cannot be said for chromium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chromium deficiency – having little to no chromium in your body – is extremely rare, and researchers have not identified any clearly defined disease caused by low chromium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like all food, essential metals must be absorbed by your digestive system. However, the gut absorbs only about 1 percent of ingested chromium. Other essential metals are absorbed more efficiently – for example, the average person absorbs around 25 percent of certain forms of ingested iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite many studies, scientists have yet to find any protein that requires chromium to carry out its biological function. Only one protein is known to bind to chromium, and this protein most likely helps your kidneys remove the metal from your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some studies in people suggest chromium might be involved to some degree in regulating blood glucose levels, research on whether adding extra chromium to your body through supplements can substantially improve your body's ability to break down and use sugar has been inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thus, based on biochemistry, there is currently no evidence that humans, or other animals, actually require chromium for any particular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that chromium might be essential for health stems from studies in the 1950s, a time when nutritionists knew very little about what trace metals are required to maintain good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One influential study involved feeding lab rats a diet that induced symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplementing their diet with chromium seemed to cure the rats of Type 2 diabetes, and medical researchers were enticed by the suggestion that chromium might provide a treatment for this disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today's widespread claims that chromium is important for regulating blood sugar can be traced to these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, these early experiments were very flawed by today's standards. They lacked the statistical analyses needed to show that their results were not due to random chance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, they lacked important controls, including measuring how much chromium was in the rats' diet to start with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later studies that were more rigorously designed provided ambiguous results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some found that rats fed chromium supplements controlled their blood sugar slightly better than rats raised on a chromium-free diet, others found no significant differences. But what was clear was that rats raised on diets that excluded chromium were perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments on people are much harder to control for than experiments on rats, and there are few well-designed clinical trials investigating the effects of chromium on patients with diabetes. Just as with the rat studies, the results are ambiguous. If there is an effect, it is very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, there has been a recommended dietary intake for chromium despite its lack of documented health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that chromium is needed for health persists due in large part to a 2001 report from the National Institute of Medicine's Panel on Micronutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This panel of nutritional researchers and clinicians was formed to evaluate available research on human nutrition and set 'adequate intake' levels of vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their recommendations form the basis of the recommended daily intake labels found on food and vitamin packaging and the NIH guidelines for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite acknowledging the lack of research demonstrating clear-cut health benefits for chromium, the panel still recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This recommendation was not based on science but rather on previous estimates of how much chromium adult Americans already ingest each day. Notably, much of this chromium is leached from stainless steel cookware and food processing equipment, rather than coming from our food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, while there may not be confirmed health risks from taking chromium supplements, there's probably no benefit either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR: You showed courage and you’ve shown leadership and I can’t thank you enough for letting me do this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So, think of that one in 20,000, and now it’s one in 12 for boys, one in 18, 19 for girls. So obviously, there’s something that’s artificially, I think, induced, something, whether it’s the vaccines in terms of these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, of a glass of water like that into a baby’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And I’ve… suggested, get them in doses, get him in, you know, maybe 20 percent, 30 percent, but smaller, not such a big. I think, you know, that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And we had certain recommendations, the MMR, take them separately. The measles is already separate now and it works out much better, but there doesn’t seem to be any impact if you take it separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you take as a combination, it’s not so great. And some other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I would say don’t take Tylenol. If you’re pregnant, and when you’re — when the baby is born, don’t give it Tylenol. You can avoid it at all, just don’t give it to Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Really, what do you have to lose? You really don’t have much to lose. Here, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SEC. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR: There’s also just, there’s many, many other confirmation studies. There’s two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol. So none of this is dispositive, but all of it is stuff that we should be paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But, you know, there’s a tremendous amount of proof or evidence, I would say, as a non-doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I’ve studied this a long time ago. You know, I met Bobby in my office 20 years ago. We were talking about the same thing 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And I was a real estate developer, but it bothered me that it seemed to be getting worse. But it’s so bad now when you hear these numbers. It’s not even really sustainable. I don’t know how people do it, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is some very strong evidence on Tylenol. In fact, at one point, I guess the company gave a warning. They gave the…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SEC. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR: They still don’t recommend it during pregnancy. That’s the weird thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They’re not recommending it, and that’s the company itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, just don’t take it. Don’t take if you’re a woman, don’t take it and don’t give it to the baby when the baby’s born. And I think that’s going to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I’d also get the shots in smaller doses. There are a few things we give, a few things that just seem to be. And I’d think you’d get that number way back up. Think of it. You have One in 20,000 and now it’s just it’s not it’s not even believable when you when you think the 20, 000 drops to 12? 12 12 children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So that’s that’s induced by something that’s given or taken and it should be able to be stopped and you’re talking about the Pennsylvania Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You were talking about the Amish, where… They don’t take any of this stuff, and they have virtually none, right? They have no autism, no autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So we’re doing something very bad. Somebody’s been given some bad things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other countries, by the way, we have, I think, one — we have 82 vaccines that we give simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And I’m a vaccine believer, by way. I believe in the polio vaccine. I believe a lot of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But when you give 82 vaccines in a shot to a little baby that hasn’t even formed yet, it’s a lot of vaccines. And in Japan, they give a much smaller number. In Germany, they gave a much more, like, 28 vaccines. That’s a lots too. But 28 is a lot different than 82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So but I would say on the Tylenol, don’t take it. And And that will be — I think it’s going to be a big factor. I think — I’ll think it’ll be a very good result. And I hope we’re going to able to see that result and then not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because certainly, people have heard us loud and clear. This is why I bring it up again. That’s why I asked you to talk about it, because this is a horrible thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if you don’t take it — I mean, you have to tough it through sometimes. There are other things you can do, but you have tough it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy for me to say. But I think you’re gonna see numbers that will be so it’ll be so significantly improved and maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Maybe fully improved. I mean this there’s something there. There’s something going on and we have to address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And so I’m addressing it the best I can as a non-doctor, but I’m a man of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 18:37:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxORlBrTlQ2OWZNckNCbzllcklvRXUyeGdnRk9HcTU4NlZJT3FEX2VfUTBTLUtreHgxMnJKcmxqMl9HUlBobWVkYjRCTTByeHAzWmJrbW9fQW9ublF3T0ZNM2xyaU1YYXV6T2hLWk1wb3ZvdFF2cW9lZW9mOWdQQWpKYWNnczhQeUQyZFFFRVJtSQ</guid></item><item><title>在多种血液蛋白质变化中发现的早期癌症线索-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/e3fc8557-de39-4fdd-b195-dad341ab9c07</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FT Digital Edition: today’s FT, cover to cover on any device.

They pointed to the at least 12 states which have brought back similar COVID-era restrictions during the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the pandemic, these requirements have become common, especially ahead of winter to try and prevent co-occurring outbreaks of the flu, COVID, RSV and norovirus - a combination season doctors have dubbed the 'quad-demic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Todd Ellerin, an infectious diseases specialist at Harvard University, told the Daily Mail: 'There are many [health care] systems, including around Boston, where when certain metrics are hit - like when the rate of influenza-like illnesses exceeds a certain threshold - then the systems will have the providers within hospitals wear masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mask mandates will not be unique to California. When you are working in places where there are vulnerable patients, it makes sense to consider mask mandates.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not everyone thinks it will be as strict everywhere as it is in some counties. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, told the Daily Mail: 'I would not think we would see widespread face mask mandates. [But] there might be recommendations or encouragements to wear masks...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is such an aversion, generally, across the country to mandates, I would not think there would be very many of those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both experts said it is likely that face masks will return in areas experiencing viral outbreaks that strain hospital systems, adding that residents will probably be urged to wear the coverings in an attempt to drive down cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many pro-maskers argue that face masks help prevent infections by catching virus-laden droplets expelled when people sneeze, cough or talk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11702865/Masks-make-little-no-difference-Covid-infections-massive-cross-country-meta-analysis-finds.html"&gt; major review &lt;/a&gt;by the Cochrane Collaboration - which has been called the 'gold standard' for evidence-based investigations by Alberto Merchante-González, chief of public health for the Spanish Ministry of Health - found that cloth coverings and surgical masks made 'little to no difference' to COVID infection or death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts have warned that many coverings contain holes that are too large to catch droplets, saying people should instead opt for the medical-grade N95 masks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have raised concerns that failing to wash reusable masks regularly can turn them into a breeding ground for bacteria, increasing the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of today, at least six counties in California's Bay Area -&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - have reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told the Daily Mail it was likely that face masks would return in areas experiencing viral outbreaks that strain hospital systems (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting November 1, each will require health workers and, in some cases, visitors or patients, to wear face coverings in medical settings used by frail, ailing or vulnerable patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karen Smith, Sonoma County's interim health officer, told the Daily Mail: 'The risk to vulnerable patients of COVID, flu and other respiratory viruses in health care remains significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, it continues to be important for face masks to be used in patient care areas when the seasonal risk of exposure to one or more viruses is high.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mandate in Sonoma County has been set to be renewed every year unless it is repealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are scant reports of other counties considering face mask mandates at present, although experts say this may shift as cooler weather approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;COVID cases have recently dropped in California, CDC wastewater data suggests, falling from 'high' to 'moderate' levels statewide. Both flu and RSV levels are also very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the state does have a higher COVID hospitalization rate than the national average - 4.4 per every 100,000 people were hospitalized with the disease in the week of September 6 - compared to 2.6 per every 100,000 nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During last year's flu season, from October 2024 to May 2025, officials saw COVID-era restrictions return in 12 states, although these were focused on certain settings and were not statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, face mask restrictions returned in some health care settings. In &lt;span&gt;Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and North Carolina, some officials brought back both mask mandates and visitor restrictions for health care facilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officials in Michigan and South Carolina only brought back visitor restrictions to hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;From 2024 to early 2025, the US experienced a worse respiratory virus season than average, with the CDC classing the season as 'high severity' and the most severe since the 2017-2018 season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, an estimated 47 million people were sick, while 610,000 were hospitalized and 26,000 died from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tyler Evans, former chief medical officer for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-2f25c290-a453-11f0-8029-1778f75a41bc" class=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail: 'Broad mandates may not be necessary right now, but we shouldn't shy away from common-sense measures in higher-risk settings, like hospitals, nursing homes and public transit during surges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the most recent COVID levels in wastewater in each state. Wastewater is one way to track the activity of a virus in communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know masks work, especially when layered with vaccination. The key is flexibility, clear guidance, and empowering people to make informed choices based on local trends.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, wastewater surveillance suggests COVID levels dropped from 'high' to 'moderate' over the week of September 20. But they were 'very high' in four states: Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada and Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both flu and RSV levels remain 'very low' across the US, although experts say this could be because the nation is at the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norovirus outbreaks also remain low. Only one outbreak of the stomach virus was recorded nationwide in August, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said levels are likely low because it is still early in the season, and warned cases could soon rise as colder weather forces more people indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15159343/Map-new-covid-strain-spread-xfg-usa.html"&gt; concerns over a new COVID variant&lt;/a&gt;, named XFG or 'Stratus,' that has become the dominant strain in the US since first arriving in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say it is not more likely to cause severe disease than previous strains, but is more transmissible than previous variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 17:32:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOaW9CWVVzTnR0MTVwNmZxd0lhZDNONnFMZ0xJdXlvaGNReFUtNnBfX0xnVDlEMkx4bHNIWGd4LW40NXgzeTRKRHVuMVV5aFI1UmJ0ajlwUUhKdzBpd1J4VnpXZnZlMFQ1NlN1WTRTNHN2WVJrc0V2MFZfTk1NWEFxTGZvM3Y0NUxNZF9faQ</guid></item><item><title>降低心脏病发作和癌症风险的新“超级食物” ……只需$ 2 -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15177451/superfood-prevent-heart-attacks-colon-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's been a staple in Asian cuisine for thousands of years, but now, kimchi is getting global attention for being the 'next superfood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is made from fermented cabbage and radish and flavored with spices. While once only common in Korean foods, the sour vegetable dish is now mixed into hundreds of meals and paired with foods like eggs, rice, avocado and even ice cream.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, researchers in the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-677f8bf0-a50f-11f0-a8c8-5720553c9d68"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;'s College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources (CAHNR) have found that consuming kimchi is associated with improved levels of blood sugar, triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood stream, and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is important for warding off &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-1ca13780-a511-11f0-a8c8-5720553c9d68"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and keeping triglyceride levels low is important for preventing heart attacks, strokes and pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, maintaining a healthy blood pressure can also help prevent heart attacks and strokes, as well as heart disease, the world's number one killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi also provides gut and digestive health benefits due to its fermentation process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fermented foods are full of probiotics, beneficial bacteria that feed the body's natural collection of bacteria, called the microbiome. This collection of bacteria promotes healthy digestion, and, researchers are increasingly positing that an unbalanced microbiome &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784061/marathon-runner-pancreas-cancer-deadly-symptoms-ignored-harmless.html"&gt;could raise the risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is readily available for a fraction of the price of 'designer' probiotics. The dish is commonly found in refrigerated sections of grocery stores and servings of it cost as little as $2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kimchi is made from fermented cabbage and radish and flavored with spices (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neuroradiologist and longevity expert Dr Kavin Mistry told Daily Mail the preliminary data is 'promising.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given how central gut health is to systemic inflammation, immune regulation, and metabolic function, I see kimchi as a potentially valuable component of a dietary pattern that supports heart health and reduces cancer risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review from the researchers in Connecticut included nine studies comprising of nearly 43,000 people carried out between 2011 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to people who did not eat fermented kimchi, those who did had a fasting glucose level of 1.93 mg/dL. It is not known what the participants' levels were before the experiment, but lower glucose levels are crucial to reduce the risk of diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, 38 million Americans have either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, and the prevalence is rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is associated with 95,000 deaths annually.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Triglyceride levels decreased by nearly 29 mg/dL. Similarly, baseline levels were not reported, but lower levels are associated with a decreased risk in heart complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High triglycerides are associated with heart disease, heart attacks, strokes and artery disease. High levels are associated with a 25 percent greater likelihood of a heart disease-related death when above 200 mg/dL, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy levels are below 100 mg/dL.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kimchi provides gut and digestive health benefits due to its fermentation process (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, hypertension, or high blood pressure, was improved. There was a decrease in both blood pressure parameters: 3.48 mm/Hg in systolic and 2.68 mmHg in diastolic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ock Chun, co-author and professor of nutritional sciences, said: 'That’s a really good number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In clinical settings, even a reduction of 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure is considered a meaningful improvement. So, seeing comparable reductions from a dietary intervention, not medication, is a very promising result.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypertension has a significant effect on overall health, especially heart health. Chronic high blood pressure can cause heart disease and heart failure. It can weaken the heart muscle, damage arteries, impair blood flow and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure afflicts nearly 50 percent of Americans, 122 million people, according to the American Heart Association and CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And heart disease accounts for one in three deaths in the US each year, about 919,000 in 2023 - the latest data available. It is the leading cause of death nationwide, as well as around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Atkinson, a general practitioner and clinical lead at telehealth company Treated, told Daily Mail kimchi can be part of a healthy lifestyle that helps prevent a slew of conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and widespread inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Its health benefits are great news for anyone looking to improve their heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diseases like hypertension and diabetes, as well as an increased risk of colon cancer, often share similar risk factors involving obesity and inflammation. So as well as trying to increase activity levels, doctors will always suggest you look at ways you can improve your health through your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And improving the diversity of your gut microbiome is a great place to start... so eating kimchi fits perfectly with [this].'  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is full of probiotics thanks to its fermentation process, and probiotics contribute to a healthy microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A preliminary investigation in 2020 by scientists in South Korea found that fermented kimchi intake led to 'significant changes' in people's fecal microbiome and the food showed 'significant' prevention in the development of colitic cancer and the formation of adenomas in the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adenomas are benign tumors but their growth increases the risk of future cancerous tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers involved in a 2022 study on the microbiome and colon cancer said: 'Under normal conditions, the gut microbiome acts as a barrier to other pathogens or infections in the intestine and modulates inflammation by affecting the host immune system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collection of bacteria in the gut play a role in modulating the body's anti-cancer immune response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Various animal and clinical experiments have demonstrated that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect the initiation of precancerous cancer lesions and cancer progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because the colorectal region is a site where changes in the gut microbiota can influence the organs directly, [colon cancer] is considered to be affected by the gut microbiome more than other tumors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/biological-underpinnings-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-begin-to-emerge-1.21721" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03299-8/d41586-025-03299-8_15338418.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Uncertainty over federal &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/vaccines/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; policy had caused a temporary patchwork of access across the country, with shots being offered in some places and not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This week, the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cdc/"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; issued &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html"&gt;new guidance&lt;/a&gt; around the use of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-19/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt; vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for vaccination and instead leaving the choice up to individuals. While it marks a change in official CDC policy, the guidance allows shots to be rolled out to pharmacies, and for states to once again offer them to people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Prior to this fall, the CDC universally recommended the Covid vaccine for anyone 6 months or older. The agency’s new guidance, drafted by a panel of experts handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., says that individuals should consult with a health care provider before getting the shot, what the agency calls “individual-based decision-making.” The CDC’s definition of providers includes physicians, nurses, and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Informed consent is back,” said Jim O’Neill, acting CDC director and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy secretary, in an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html"&gt;October 6 statement&lt;/a&gt;. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual Covid-19 boosters deterred healthcare providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, first moved to restrict Covid vaccines in May, when &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138"}' href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would no longer recommend them to healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Confusion mounted in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated Covid vaccines but only for adults ages 65 and older and younger people with medical conditions that put them at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;higher risk of severe disease&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, Covid shots were indicated for anyone 6 months and older. Because of differing state laws that determine the scope of practice for pharmacists, the change triggered pharmacies in some states to require a prescription, while in others pharmacies stopped offering the shots entirely. Several states, however, took swift action to restore access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 14:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQb1loZkJGdU0yd0ZHWFdVcnRqbndkXzFnR1JJa2Y3bkxkS2NCYmNnbEFld2J6MWpudTc4ZlJMTV9KYnRFTElvX3hNODd5RXdrcmcyLVZqQVI2MnU2a0E2dUVTaEdqWGs3M0d0cXFBWTVkLWZPYWNBdXpkbDVRTks4SWlqWjZZMlFoMlFVdFV6X2ctbWVTUE1r</guid></item><item><title>不安腿综合征与帕金森病的关系- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-restless-leg-syndrome-parkinson-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three research hospitals in the Republic of Korea are reporting that restless leg syndrome was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, with 1.6% of patients with restless leg syndrome developing Parkinson's disease vs. 1.0% in matched controls and a shorter average time to diagnosis at a 15-year horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

While pathophysiology remains unclear, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical care&lt;/a&gt; often uses &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dopamine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt; agonists as first-line therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in movement control. Dopamine agonists mimic the effects of dopamine by activating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dopamine+receptors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dopamine receptors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease patients experience reduced dopamine and use dopamine agonists as the primary treatment to help improve movement control. Previous studies have examined links between the two disorders and questioned whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/restless+leg+syndrome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt; could be triggered by the same dopaminergic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Risk of Parkinson Disease Among Patients With Restless Leg Syndrome," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2839651" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retrospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; to assess whether restless leg syndrome is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease and whether the dopamine pathway is meaningfully associated with both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Data came from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort spanning 2002 to 2019, a deidentified database representing a 2% stratified random sample of the Korean population. Final analytic groups comprised 9,919 patients with restless leg syndrome and 9,919 matched controls. Mean age at enrollment measured about 50 years in both groups, with 62.8% women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine agonist exposure was defined as receipt of pramipexole or ropinirole during two or more distinct clinical visits, forming a dopamine treated subgroup, with remaining patients classified as dopamine nontreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall incidence of Parkinson's disease reached 1.6% in the restless leg syndrome cohort, 60% higher than the 1.0% in matched controls. Subgroup analysis showed that those taking a dopamine agonist had only 0.5% Parkinson's incidence compared to 2.1% in the nontreated group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that restless leg syndrome may be associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Patients with restless leg syndrome who were not treated with dopamine agonists tended to have an elevated risk of Parkinson's and a slightly shorter time to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study does not imply that early use of dopamine agonists prevents or delays Parkinson's disease, as the design was not powered to determine this, but it could hint at a delay in diagnostic symptoms or a potential neuroprotective effect that could be the subject of future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest a connection between the two conditions that may involve mechanisms beyond the dopaminergic pathway. Clarifying this association and the role of the dopamine pathway may improve understanding of the pathophysiology of both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Few things in this world are more miserable than food poisoning. You go out to eat some delicious foods, or cook at home. You’re happy, full, and then… everything goes south. Sometimes literally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But hark! This torturous fate may soon be vanquished, thanks to some scientists at the University of Maryland who might just have created a vaccine that protects against Salmonella bacteria, one of the most common sources of foodborne illness and potentially life-threatening infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the researchers have tested out their vaccine in human volunteers in a Phase I clinical trial. Not only did the vaccine appear to be safe and well-tolerated, it also seemed to create a robust immune response to the target bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings provide a strong foundation for future studies,” study co-author Myron Levine, professor emeritus at UM’s School of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-vaccine-typhoid-invasive-salmonella-human.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The results were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04003-z"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A pervasive threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When people get Salmonella, it’s typically caused by a specific species of the bacteria, called &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt;. But there are many subtypes, or serovars, of Salmonella within this species. One notorious subtype (&lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhi) causes typhoid fever—an extreme form of food poisoning that causes a high fever (hence the name), a cough, rash, nausea, weakness, and diarrhea, and which can last as long as a month and require special antibiotics to treat. Other, non-typhoidal subtypes cause more typical food poisoning symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The most common sources of Salmonella are undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, or unwashed fruit and vegetables, as well as through contact with infected people. Typhoid spreads similarly, and through water contaminated with the urine or feces of an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More than a million Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/php/data-research/foodborne-illness-burden/index.html"&gt;sickened&lt;/a&gt; by Salmonella every year, and tens of thousands are hospitalized as a result. Most Salmonella infections don’t last long—just a few days or a week—but they can sometimes lead to severe, even fatal illness. These severe cases tend to happen when the bacteria spreads beyond the digestive tract and invades other parts of the body. They’re also more likely to occur in children under five, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s vaccine targets three different subtypes of Salmonella: the bacteria that cause typhoid fever and two other subtypes that are a common source of invasive infections in young children, especially in less developed areas of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s vaccine is a conjugate vaccine, meaning it combines polysaccharide antigens (sugar molecules, to put it plainly) from the outer coating of these bacteria with a carrier protein that boosts the immune system’s ability to recognize the bacteria. The vaccine is currently code-named the trivalent Salmonella conjugate vaccine, or TSCV.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Early promise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested TSCV in a small, controlled trial involving 22 healthy adult volunteers from the U.S. Two groups received varying doses of the vaccine, while the third was given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phase I trials are primarily meant to vet a drug or vaccine’s safety, and TSCV passed with flying colors. The vaccine was found to be safe, with the most common adverse event being pain at the injection site. Importantly, the researchers also detected a immune response to the three subtypes in all the vaccinated volunteers, including the production of antibodies, suggesting that TSCV works as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the findings are based on a small sample size. There is still plenty more work needed to affirm the vaccine’s broader safety and effectiveness. But if it keeps hitting its milestones, then TSCV could be a boon to the world, and especially for the people most vulnerable to severe Salmonella infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These results are highly encouraging,” lead researcher Wilbur Chen, a professor of medicine at UM, said in a statement. “They show that TSCV has the potential to protect children in regions where both typhoid and Salmonella are endemic and deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;TSCV’s potential benefits could extend even beyond that. The subtypes it targets don’t just cause invasive infections, the researchers note, they’re also some of the most common strains of Salmonella that cause food poisoning in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it is always important to practice good food safety and proper hygiene no matter what (wash your hands and don’t undercook your chicken, people), but it’d be incredible to know that in the future, when you are chowing down, Salmonella could be one less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a 49-year-old man visited Dr. Danielle Belardo, a cardiologist, with chest pain. For some time, he had been treating his high cholesterol not with the statin suggested by his doctor, but with berberine and red yeast rice supplements. He had heard they were more natural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplements hadn’t managed his condition — far from it. Belardo discovered that he not only still had high cholesterol, but also had elevated liver enzymes and coronary artery disease so severe that he needed open-heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She referred him for the procedure and started him on two medications to bring down his cholesterol, including a statin. She also told him to quit the supplements. A few weeks later, the liver issues resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when Americans are buying and taking record amounts of supplements — well over half of adults consume one — some doctors and dietitians are trying to persuade patients to take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her practice in Pasadena, Calif., Belardo often takes a hard line, regularly “de-prescribing” supplements. Last year, she persuaded one patient to stop taking 132 of them, including some to “detox” the kidneys and liver. Marily Oppezzo, an instructor of medicine at Stanford Prevention Research Center and a registered dietitian, said she channels decluttering powerhouse Marie Kondo by asking patients which ones spark “real, evidence-backed joy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of gummies, pills and powders are categorized as supplements, including vitamins and minerals, compounds like creatine and herbal products such as ashwagandha and kava. Almost all doctors say a few of them have their place; women benefit from taking folic acid, for example, when trying to have a baby. Some people have vitamin or mineral deficiencies that supplements can help address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supplements can also come with side effects, which patients are sometimes “shocked” to learn about, said Dr. Mitra Rezvani, a hospitalist at Westchester Medical Center in New York. Many are merely uncomfortable — stomach issues, for example. But some are more serious. One paper in The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that supplements are responsible for 23,000 emergency room visits a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways doctors broach the issue can vary. Rezvani has had patients list everything they’re taking and explain why, which helps start a discussion about what they should reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN in San Francisco, tries to not push too hard. “The worst thing you can do is make a patient feel like they can’t talk to you,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, when she sees yet another patient taking probiotic supplements, “I’m always like, ‘Well, if those worked, you wouldn’t be coming to see me.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt; Nausea and rashes &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration only lightly regulates supplements, monitoring them less rigorously than drugs and not approving them for safety or effectiveness before they reach the public. Supplements have been found to be mislabeled, in terms of both the ingredients and their concentration. And some mix poorly with certain medications or with one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of what some have called “the wild west” nature of the market, it can be difficult to predict adverse side effects. Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements, had one 45-year-old patient who developed rashes on her legs and back after starting on an anti-migraine supplement. Cohen suggested she stop taking the supplement, and the rashes went away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunter worries about Ayurvedic supplements, some of which have been found to include lead, arsenic and mercury. Other doctors watch out for signs of supplement-related liver damage. Last year, researchers at the University of Michigan estimated that 15 million American adults take a supplement that could potentially cause liver toxicity, such as turmeric or red yeast rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rezvani once treated a 70-year-old woman who had been experiencing nausea, jaundice and dark urine after starting a turmeric supplement, as well as semaglutide, the compound in the medication Ozempic. Rezvani and her team determined the supplement had likely damaged the liver and possibly interacted with the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient stopped taking the supplement. Soon after, her liver function improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overlooking underlying issues &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belardo said she understands why her patients turn to supplements. Prominent doctors sell and promote them online. The pharmaceutical and health care industries have left many Americans disillusioned. And some patients feel dismissed at the doctor, leading them to seek out alternative treatments for their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, people may take a supplement to manage an unwanted symptom, instead of undergoing medical testing that would reveal the root cause of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a 44-year-old woman came to Belardo for an evaluation. During the visit, the patient noted that, on a naturopath’s recommendation, she had been taking an iron supplement to treat anemia and fatigue, but she still felt tired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iron supplement itself didn’t concern Belardo. What did was that the naturopath had not probed the underlying problem. In hopes of figuring it out, Belardo sent the patient to a gastroenterologist, who performed a colonoscopy. The diagnosis: stage IV colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an extreme version of a type of situation that frustrates her most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Months, if not years, of opportunity for earlier detection and treatment had been lost,” Belardo said, “because her care was reduced to supplement prescriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lifestyle modification remains “a cornerstone” of MASLD management. Current guidelines advise against SSBs, but the evidence regarding LNSSBs remains “limited,” Liu explained in her presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers analyzed data of 123,788 UK Biobank participants without liver disease at baseline who were followed for an average of 10.3 years. Beverage consumption was assessed through repeated 24-hour dietary questionnaires using the question: “How many glasses, cans, or cartons containing 250 mL (roughly 250 g) of SSBs or LNSSBs did you drink yesterday?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intake was averaged across at least two recalls, and participants were grouped into three intake categories: none, more than 0 to one serving per day, or more than one serving per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was incident MASLD, and secondary outcomes included liver-related mortality and liver fat content measured using MRI-derived proton density fat fraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fully adjusted multivariable Cox model, compared with no consumption, consuming more than one serving of LNSSBs daily was associated with a 60% higher risk for MASLD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.599). The level of consumption of SSBs was associated with a 50% higher risk (HR, 1.469).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming more than one serving of LNSSBs daily was also associated with a higher risk for severe liver outcomes (HR, 1.555), while SSBs showed no significant association after adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither SSBs nor LNSSBs showed significant associations with all-cause mortality in fully adjusted models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting either beverage with water reduced the risk for MASLD by 12.8% for SSBs and 15.2% for LNSSBs, Liu reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both beverage types were positively associated with higher liver fat content. Consumption of more than one serving of SSBs and LNSSBs daily was associated with about 5% and 7% higher liver fat levels, respectively, than nonconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The higher sugar content in SSBs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2089224-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, promote weight gain, and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation. LNSSBs, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings, and even stimulating insulin secretion,” Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. Water remains the best choice as it removes the metabolic burden and prevents fat accumulation in the liver, whilst hydrating the body,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Study Needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, Sujit V. Janardhan, MD, PhD, director of the steatotic liver disease program, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, said the findings “certainly should cause one to take pause from the popular notion that diet or non-sugar-sweetened beverages are healthier than their sugar-sweetened alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, however, that it would be “important to confirm cofounders are adequately addressed in this large population-based study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must better understand what other exposure and characteristics were present in patients who had increased intake of non-sugar-sweetened beverages,” Janardhan told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, it’s possible people who drank more non-sugar-sweetened beverages had more cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors (which prompted them to switch to the ‘diet’ alternative) and that it is these comorbidities that drove an association with increased MASLD incidence and liver-related mortality,” Janardhan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there is one finding that seems easy to take away from this study, it’s that people who drank more water in place of sweetened beverages had reduced risk of MASLD,” he told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while awaiting results of mechanistic studies and careful confounder analysis, “plain old boring water is your best bet,” Janardhan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study had no specific funding. Liu and Janardhan had no relevant disclosures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:01:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOb0QwbndaelUzSkF1SDZxOGJYSF9YMVNvdTVpT1pFUEZqbGphUklYeC1uSW1JNWQ5Nlpqblozb1hvYzJxVUg3bzY4bXhTLU5RZWdEVDQyS196WXA0c1hBd3pQLUtPZGFnNTJSaExBc3dPSm85Mm10ZlhVT1lZRTVOYUpqZ3ptbUtONGdQM3V5dGhORlF1QTVURw</guid></item><item><title>裸盖菇素治疗与减少精神疾病患者的自杀念头有关- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/psilocybin-therapy-linked-to-reduced-suicidal-thoughts-in-people-with-psychiatric-disorders/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20451253251372449" target="_blank"&gt;Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that psilocybin therapy may reduce suicidal ideation in adults with psychiatric conditions. The findings come from a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials and suggest that the psychedelic compound, when paired with psychological support, may have a modest but measurable impact on decreasing thoughts of suicide. Although suicide attempts and deaths were not observed in these trials, the results point to the possibility that psilocybin could play a role in mental health treatment strategies aimed at reducing suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms, sometimes called “magic mushrooms.” It affects the brain by stimulating serotonin receptors, particularly one known to play a role in mood regulation and emotional processing. When administered in controlled clinical settings alongside therapy, psilocybin has been shown to help relieve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and some forms of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in psilocybin as a therapeutic agent has grown rapidly in recent years, especially for people who do not respond to standard treatments like antidepressants or talk therapy. Some smaller studies have suggested that psilocybin therapy might also reduce suicidal ideation, a symptom common in many psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given suicide’s widespread toll on public health, researchers wanted to evaluate whether these early signs held up across multiple trials. To do this, they examined all available randomized controlled trials that reported on suicide-related outcomes in people undergoing psilocybin therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was inspired to investigate the usage of psilocybin therapy to help treat my patients who suffer from treatment resistant depression. As I was reading the latest clinical trials at the time, there were some reports of increasing suicidal ideation. Increasing suicidal ideation would be a risk in this vulnerable population. When I was reviewing the literature, there was not much synthesized evidence which inspired me to pursue this study,” explained study author Stanley Wong, a general psychiatry resident at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the potential impact of psilocybin therapy on suicidal ideation and behaviors, the research team carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic review collects and evaluates all relevant studies on a specific topic using a structured and transparent process. A meta-analysis goes a step further by statistically combining results from multiple studies to estimate an overall effect. This method is often used in medicine to determine how well a treatment works by comparing evidence across different settings, sample sizes, and trial designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team searched four major scientific databases for randomized controlled trials involving adults with psychiatric disorders who received psilocybin therapy and for whom suicide-related outcomes were reported. They identified nine studies with a total of 593 participants: 335 received psilocybin therapy, while 258 were assigned to control conditions. Seven of these studies provided usable data for the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, on average, participants who received psilocybin therapy experienced a small reduction in suicidal ideation compared to those in the control groups. There was no evidence of publication bias, which suggests that the results were not skewed by the selective reporting of positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a small but significant reduction in suicidal ideation in adults receiving psilocybin therapy compared to control,” Wong told PsyPost. “Clinically, this could mean a potential reduction in the frequency or intensity of suicidal thoughts, and people living with treatment resistant depression, which could greatly enhance their well-being in quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, none of the studies reported suicide attempts or deaths during the course of the trials. However, one study did observe suicidal behavior in a small number of participants who received a higher dose of psilocybin. The difference was not statistically significant when compared to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised and glad that there was no death by suicide in any of the trials conducted,” Wong said. “All the studies used standardized scales to follow the suicidal thoughts of their participants. This speaks to the degree of importance these studies placed on the safety of participants of not just physical adverse outcomes but also psychological ones as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis also explored whether factors like funding source, study location, or the use of blinding (in which participants and staff are kept unaware of who received the active drug) affected the results. No clear differences emerged between subgroups. Interestingly, studies that used a single dose of psilocybin showed a more consistent reduction in suicidal ideation than those using multiple doses, although the sample sizes for multiple-dose studies were smaller, making the findings harder to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most trials were able to maintain the blind design on paper, two studies assessed whether staff could guess who had received psilocybin based on participants’ behavior. In nearly every case, they guessed correctly, raising concerns about the potential for bias. This issue is common in psychedelic trials, where the effects are often obvious to both participants and researchers, even when a placebo or active control is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides a useful snapshot of the current evidence but also highlights several limitations. Most trials included small numbers of participants, which can make findings less reliable and more vulnerable to overestimating the benefits of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the trials were designed specifically to study suicide prevention, so suicide-related outcomes were often recorded as secondary measures or adverse events. There was also considerable variation in how suicidal ideation was measured across trials, with some using dedicated suicide assessment tools and others relying on a single item within broader depression scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important issue is that people with high levels of suicidal ideation or a history of suicide attempts were often excluded from participating in these trials. This makes it difficult to generalize the findings to individuals at the highest risk, who may have the most to gain or lose from a new treatment. Additionally, while psilocybin therapy appeared to reduce suicidal thoughts in the short term, long-term follow-up data were limited, leaving questions about whether the benefits last over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In adults with psychiatric diagnoses (mainly treatment resistant depression), psilocybin therapy may reduce suicidal ideation through its antidepressive effects,” Wong said. “However, further research is required to understand the long-term effects of psilocybin therapy on suicidal thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of how psilocybin therapy exerts its effects. Researchers suspect that the reduction in suicidal ideation is likely tied to the therapy’s broader antidepressant properties. Psilocybin interacts with serotonin systems in the brain, modulates activity in regions involved in emotion, and may promote neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists also believe the experience itself—often described as intense, emotional, or personally meaningful—may help people shift their perspective and find new meaning in life. Others point to the possibility that psilocybin reduces hopelessness, a known risk factor for suicide. However, none of these explanations have been specifically tested in the context of suicide-related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these potential mechanisms more directly, perhaps by examining brain scans, molecular markers, or psychological changes before and after treatment. Studies could also include participants with higher baseline risk for suicide and follow them for longer periods to better understand safety and durability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psilocybin therapy, like most emergent therapies being invested gained, are conducted in smaller sample sizes for many reasons, including safety and cost,” Wong told PsyPost. “As such, the true effect size of the reduction in suicidal ideation is still yet to be determined. However, the findings from our study points towards a positive finding for those suffering from treatment resistant depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like to further investigate whether or not the reduction in suicidal ideation is maintained in long-term follow up studies. I would also like to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms in which psilocybin therapy reduces suicidal ideation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psilocybin therapy has really opened doors for potential treatment options for those who suffer from treatment resistant depression – I am excited to see what the future has in store for this emerging field of psychedelic psychiatry,” Wong added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20451253251372449" target="_blank"&gt;Effect of psilocybin therapy on suicidal ideation, attempts, and deaths in people with psychiatric diagnoses: a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Stanley Wong, Gray Meckling, Nicholas Fabiano, Sanghun Lee, Brett D.

If all childhood immunizations were given separately, it would take 20 visits to get a six-month-old fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The more visits, the more appointments, the more follow-up doses that are required, parents – given that lives are complicated and vaccine schedules are complicated – will be less likely to complete all the additional appointments or follow-up visits required,” Schwartz said. “Splitting up will mean that fewer kids will complete the MMR series.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Breaking them up “serves no purpose”, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. “We’re already talking about difficulties in affording all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some vaccines, like the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) shot, are only made together and cannot be broken up. While separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella were licensed in the 1960s, only the combined MMR shots are now available for use in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The current MMR shots in the US are made by Merck and GSK. Both companies have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; there is no published scientific evidence to support separating the vaccines, and the combination vaccines play an important role in making vaccination easy and inexpensive. Releasing separate vaccines now would require entirely new saline placebo-controlled clinical trials under new Trump administration policies – an “unimaginable” process when safe and effective vaccines already exist, Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if manufacturers were able to create new trials for separate vaccines, it would be “incredibly unethical” to conduct them, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You would be exposing, basically, infants to potentially lethal diseases,” she said. No ethics and regulatory board would approve such a trial, and providers and families are unlikely to participate, she added. “Those trials won’t happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was another &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) planned for 22-23 October. It has been indefinitely postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s anyone’s guess,” Schwartz said. The ACIP could say they would like to see monovalent vaccines, but there are no monovalent vaccines approved for them to recommend, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the meeting in September, the independent advisers began a discussion of delaying the hepatitis B vaccine, the first of which is currently recommended at birth, but they tabled the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Young children usually receive later hepatitis B doses as part of combination shots – so if that recommendation is changed, the combination vaccines would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit has “no idea” what the vaccine advisers might discuss, he said. “These people are not making decisions based on scientific data, they’re making decisions based on their own sort of anti-vaccine notions – so who knows. Anything can happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But, he said, discussions about breaking up MMR specifically were asked and answered by the ACIP more than two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit served on the ACIP from 1998 to 2003, during which time the now-retracted study led by Andrew Wakefield was published and gained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wakefield claimed without evidence in the study that there was a potential link too autism between “the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine)”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A year before the study was published, Wakefield had filed a patent application for a monovalent measles vaccine, though he did not disclose this conflict of interest in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wakefield argued that the combination shot weakened the immune system and created cascading effects that led to autism. “We had no evidence for any of this,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ACIP held a vote on changing the MMR vaccine recommendation soon after the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We obviously all voted no, because there was no evidence that MMR caused autism,” Offit said. There were already epidemiological studies at that time showing no relationship between being autistic and getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In September, the ACIP voted to remove the recommendation for the combination MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, a move that was officially adopted by the CDC last week. The changes are already creating confusion among patients and pediatric offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Let’s not underestimate just how damaging complexity and confusion are for vaccination efforts, for both patients and families and healthcare providers,” Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Making the process more confusing, expensive and time-consuming is another way to keep kids from being vaccinated, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By making many of these vaccines monovalent, that’s going to actually just remove access to them, and there won’t be any vaccines at all,” she continued. “Those vaccines will probably still get made, but if a vaccine is sitting on a shelf and not going into somebody’s arm, then it’s worthless, essentially. I think anti-vaxxers love vaccines that sit on shelves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBheU4yQ0FoRURraGJrNF9GYmQ4aVZheDdFNGVmaElFWFpJZ2Y5X0p4MHBNNHU4UjJpLVNqdHFvVTNSQ1l5ejh0aWxtX0VKejUzeFQtRnVUaTl1cUl0UnFEQ0dyZWlNUzhpbm85T19oT1ZlN0xqUUdtaVpCY1N4dw</guid></item><item><title>根据医生的说法，流感疫苗注射后应避免的三件事-包括服用扑热息痛-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15176739/flu-jab-complications-paracetamol-warning.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adults who develop such disorders are underrepresented in both the research and within treatment settings, leaving a critical gap in understanding the true scope of the problem, said Samantha DeCaro, a psychologist, and the director of clinical outreach and education at the &lt;a href="https://renfrewcenter.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7954061" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Renfrew Center&lt;/a&gt;, a national eating disorder treatment center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Midlife adults meet the same diagnostic criteria as younger patients ― struggling with symptoms such as restricting, bingeing or purging,” said DeCaro, who also co-hosts the podcast &lt;a href="https://allbodiesallfoods.podbean.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7954061" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Bodies. All Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What sets them apart, however, are the unique life transitions that can trigger or exacerbate body dissatisfaction and disordered eating: menopause, divorce, an ‘empty nest,’ chronic illness, physical changes, and the challenges of aging in an ageist society,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

Perched on a hill close to a set of railroad tracks, he could memorise all the numbers of the train carriages that sped by at &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;30 mph,&lt;/span&gt; add them up, and provide the correct total sum. What was remarkable about the case was not just his ability to calculate large numbers (and read them on a moving vehicle), but the fact that he could barely eat unassisted or recognise the faces of people he met. The juxtaposition between his supposed arrested development and his numerical facility made his mathematical feats even more impressive. ‘How can you account for it?’ asked the article’s author. The answer took the form of a medical label: the boy was what 19th-century medicine termed an ‘idiot savant’. He possessed an exceptional talent, despite a profound impairment of the mental faculties that affected both his motor and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A century after &lt;em&gt;The Review &lt;/em&gt;relayed the prodigious child’s mathematical abilities, trying to understand ‘how they do it’ still drives psychological research into savantism or ‘savant syndrome’ to this day. The SSM Health Treffert Centre in Wisconsin – named after Darold Treffert (1933-2020), one of the leading experts in the field – defines the savant phenomenon as ‘a rare condition in which persons with various developmental disorders, including autistic disorder, have an amazing ability and talent’. Today, savantism is largely comprehended through the lens of &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/psychology/neurodiversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;neurodivergence&lt;/a&gt;, since the association between savantism and autism is strong: roughly one in 10 people with autism exhibit some savant skills, while savantism in the absence of autism is much rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological studies by Simon Baron-Cohen and Michael Lombardo, for example, have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5789212/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;focused&lt;/a&gt; on the neurological basis of ‘systemising’, where exceptional mathematical or musical skills exist among people diagnosed with autism: such people are ‘hypersystemisers’, that is, they are especially good at identifying ‘laws, rules, and/or regularities’. It is believed that their brain’s systemising mechanisms are ‘tuned to very high levels’, making them acutely sensitive to sensory input and also capable of intense attentional focus and rule-learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the past (autism became a diagnostic category only in 1943), the ‘idiot savant’ was a paradox, who confounded categorisation because there was no unified way of comprehending how such exceptional musical and numerical skills might co-exist alongside their polar opposite: profound disability. To use the language of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century,&lt;/span&gt; how could a person be at once both a ‘genius’ and an ‘idiot’? The savant challenged conventional understandings of how talent was manifested, and who could manifest it, and at the same time upset notions of who might be classed as an ‘idiot’. In the scheme of how intelligence was understood then, the savant was at best otherworldly and at worst a monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historian Patrick McDonagh &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/liverpool-scholarship-online/book/15444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that ‘idiocy’ was a highly ambiguous medical term that was nonetheless widely accepted. Perhaps, in part, because it was a boundaried category that fulfilled an important social-symbolic function: namely, it offered a contrast against which modern individuals could define themselves as rational and intelligent, reinforcing their claims to respect and social authority. It also meant that people like that 11-year-old boy who was fascinated with numbers but was nonetheless considered an ‘idiot’ – in the medical parlance of the day – created a contradiction that continues to have implications today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he term ‘idiot savant’ was coined in the 1860s by the French physician and educational reformer Edouard Séguin &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1812-80).&lt;/span&gt; While researching the state of education for so-called ‘feeble-minded children’ in the United States (where he became naturalised), Séguin identified a particular type of child who seemed to excel in one skill despite demonstrating significant mental impairment. According to Séguin, these ‘idiot savants’ were specific to the elite classes, which were already characterised by their excessive desire for luxury and lack of useful contribution to society. For Séguin, the idiot savant – ‘Men abnormally developed in one direction … but idiotic in every other respect’ – was the physical embodiment of this uselessness. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is from this [wealthier] class almost exclusively that we have musical, mathematical, architectural, and other varieties of the &lt;em&gt;idiot savant&lt;/em&gt;; useless protrusion of a single faculty, accompanied by a wo[e]ful general impotence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when the middle classes were grappling with the fear of social degeneration, Séguin’s pejorative comments went beyond medical observation to reflect a broader critical attitude towards the aristocracy, who were viewed as effete, weakened and hypochondriacal. The idiot savant reinforced these class stereotypes: even their talents, no matter how precocious, were useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Séguin’s position was by no means universal. Physicians like John Langdon Down in England argued that cases of ‘idiots savants’ could be found among all classes of society, and that their exceptional talent could (and should) be trained as a way to contribute to society through their art and skills. One of the savants under Langdon Down’s care was James Henry Pullen, who arrived at the Earlswood Asylum in Surrey in 1850 at the age of 15. Unschooled and largely deaf, he had a very restricted vocabulary: what little Pullen could write or say had been taught to him by his family. However, he showed an enthusiasm for drawing and carving; he had been whittling ships from small pieces of firewood from a young age and without any training in carpentry and, after arriving at Earlswood, he was put to work in the carpenter’s shop. Quickly, he became an expert carpenter. He built furniture for the asylum, though his true delight was in fashioning large-scale models of real and imagined ships. Pullen, his caretaker explained, ‘could build exquisite model ships from drawings, and carve with a great deal of skill, who yet could not understand a sentence – who had to have it dissected for him.’ Pullen’s career spanned his &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;66 years&lt;/span&gt; at Earlswood, during which time his ships won numerous prizes and international recognition – including that of Edward, Prince of Wales, who sent him ivory tusks as encouragement to continue producing &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;his art.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Her caretakers praised her sweet mannerisms and happy demeanour, which fit with the humble values of the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langdon Down believed that, by developing their skills, individuals such as Pullen could become both more self-supporting and useful to society. Indeed, such beliefs were the driving motivation behind the education of intellectually disabled individuals in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century.&lt;/span&gt; Like many other labels used to pathologise behaviour, for example the ‘juvenile delinquent’ and the ‘homosexual’, the creation of the ‘idiot savant’ medical category became crucial in debates about rights and responsibilities in a period characterised by a strong belief in the meritocratic order of society, as a tool to legitimise social difference – and to moralise it too, by invoking the need to be charitable. Pullen’s case illustrates how individual talent, social recognition and institutional benefits could co-exist and shape the lived experience of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is exemplified in the case of a young talented woman, whose name has been lost to history, permanently resident at the renowned psychiatric hospital &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;La Salpêtrière&lt;/span&gt; in Paris. Born blind and both physically and intellectually disabled, her ‘musical memory and voice’ were a joy both to her and to those who shared their day-to-day lives with her. She was involved in the asylum choir and was responsible for correcting the other members’ voices. Her caretakers praised her sweet mannerisms and happy demeanour, which fit with the humble values of the time: one must not brag about what one is born with, but accept it with grace, and use it for the common good. Her skills were so well known that the contemporary composers Jean-Antoine-Just Géraldy, Franz Liszt and Giacomo Meyerbeer all visited her in person and praised her unique talent. As the asylum director explained, her talent would have warranted a high social status had it not been for the fact that she was highly dependent on others to look after herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;uring the second half of the 19th century, the nature of genius became one of the central debates within the human sciences. In the context of the theory of degeneration, which migrated from natural history to evolutionary theory, and which &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957154X9300401501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that civilisation was in decline due to the inheritance of undesirable characteristics, genius became an ambiguous quality: it could either guarantee progress or further contribute to society’s decay. Understanding what genius was and how it emerged became a pressing issue with social consequences. Was genius something that appeared spontaneously, or the product of an individual’s hard efforts? Could it be harnessed and cultivated for the greater good? Less positively, genius had historically been associated with madness in some way, and this posed yet another issue: was genius a pathology? Were people with prodigious abilities actually mad? And what did that mean for those men responsible for the progress of society, who were often classed as geniuses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three singular authors came to represent each of these questions: the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso, the British eugenicist Francis Galton, and the British sexologist Havelock Ellis. Using statistical analysis, Galton claimed that genius was an inherited quality that emerged independently from education. It was for this reason that men of science begot other men of science: genius was handed down. His hereditarian understanding of genius had important implications for the theory of eugenics, which took hold in the early &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; among thinkers convinced that a better society (or ‘race’) of people might be built by encouraging reproduction between individuals who had exceptional qualities useful to the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;That his father, grandfather and brother were all drummers was proof of the patient’s apparently innate talent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Lombroso – notorious for his work on criminal anthropology and the creation of criminal ‘types’ based solely on physical features – argued that genius was a pathological condition similar to insanity. For Lombroso, genius was like a pearl: the result of a morbid alteration that produced something beautiful. But the fact that it could be found among criminals confirmed its ultimately sick nature. Finding a middle ground, Ellis proposed that genius was a hereditary trait associated with idiocy (as opposed to madness), whereby one faculty was overdeveloped at the expense of the rest of the proper functioning of the mind and body. By way of example, he cited the excessive clumsiness that geniuses often seemed to exhibit, but the key to understanding the real nature of talent rested, Ellis argued, in the figure of the ‘idiot savant’ rather than the lunatic, thereby placing genius on the same scale as idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, physicians debated whether or not talent ran in the families of savants. Some cited examples of several family members demonstrating the same ability, among them the case of a man permanently resident at the Salpêtrière who, without ever having played an instrument, had the opportunity to pick up a drum and play with great talent. Upon further inspection, it turned out that the other men in his family were all skilled drum players: that his father, grandfather and brother had all been drummers was proof of the patient’s apparently innate talent. Other physicians countered that the appearance of this ability was random, even freakish; leaning into the paradox of the patient, they confirmed that his ability was pathological, while also highlighting its admirable exceptionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he study of genius was linked to another issue: the problem of precocity. During the 19th and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th centuries,&lt;/span&gt; as studies in the field of child development grew, and the IQ test, which defined intelligence in quantifiable terms, became an increasingly &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-dark-history-of-intelligence-as-domination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;common tool&lt;/a&gt; to sort children into categories, two different ‘types’ of age became relevant: chronological and mental. The former referred to the natural passing of time of any individual, with its associated physical changes and growth. Meanwhile, mental age indicated the different skills and behaviours that most individuals reached at a similar point in time, reflecting different stages of mental development. Proper development required a correlation between the two, and any deviation from the norm was pathologised. Precocity and idiocy were two sides of the same coin: a lack of correspondence between the individual’s natural age and their &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;mental age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradigmatic example of precocity was the child prodigy. Records of precocious children date back to the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;18th century,&lt;/span&gt; with examples including Mozart and Christian Heinrich Heineken, a prodigious child also known as ‘the infant scholar of Lübeck’, who, in his brief four years of life, could speak fluent German by the age of one, and read different biblical canons at the ages of two and three. However, as Andrea Graus has &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/hop0000192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t until the mid-&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century&lt;/span&gt; that the figure of the child prodigy became a more widespread cultural phenomenon. Linked to the emergence of the entertainment industry and also the growth of developmental psychology, these children became subjects of scientific and popular fascination. Parents and managers alike quickly saw the economic benefit they could obtain from such children, and toured them nationally and internationally, in line with a culture of spectacle that drew masses of people to witness ‘freaks’ of nature. The performances of children like the Italian ‘mental calculator’ Vito Mangiamele &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1827-97),&lt;/span&gt; the Spanish pianist Pepito Arriola &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1895-1954)&lt;/span&gt; or the Polish-born chess player Samuel Reshevsky &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1911-92)&lt;/span&gt; attracted large crowds, while they also became subjects of scientific scrutiny as psychologists tried to understand how it was possible for such talent to appear at such a young age. (Their answer? They had a prodigious memory, rather than any kind of creative ability.) The child prodigy embodied contradictory images of genius on the one hand, and mechanistic underdevelopment on the other: the same contrast that appeared in the idiot savant, whose representatives were often infantilised on account of their idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conflicting understandings came together in one of the most famous examples of savantism in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century:&lt;/span&gt; the pianist and composer Thomas ‘Blind Tom’ Wiggins. His case stands out for its singularity: Wiggins was Black, born into enslavement, and had both a physical and a mental disability. By the age of five, he demonstrated an exceptional talent for playing the piano and composing his own music, and at eight he began a career playing solo shows. Wiggins was exhibited across the country by his slaveholder (and, later, his manager), and the pamphlets advertising his talent claimed that it was purely natural, a raw material that could be ‘extracted’ for entertainment purposes, and was both fascinating and grotesque in its genius. (The analogy of extraction is not a coincidence: the historian Lindsay J Wright &lt;a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/ncm/article-abstract/47/1/33/197215/Black-Musicality-and-the-Invention-of-Talent-The?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that Wiggins’s career took place against the backdrop of the Californian Gold Rush.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;One of the explanations put forward to explain Wiggins’s skill directly invoked his Blackness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, historians of Wiggins’s case have cast doubt on the &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; nature of his genius. While the shows emphasised his improvisational skills and ability to copy tunes from a young age as illustrations of his innate talent, historians note that Wiggins received piano lessons and was accompanied by an instructor with whom he practised his own compositions and those of others. Those close to Wiggins also pointed out that he was not an idiot, but rather ‘frantically delighted or bewitched, if you please, over the music he is making or hearing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiggins attained a celebrity status accessible to only a few during his period. People were mesmerised by his skill. In 1912, a chronicler for &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Star&lt;/em&gt; described it as Wiggins ‘fe[eling] his way through the mazes of the most complex music’ in a way that was superhuman, as though he was touched by God. But others branded it monstrous. The American writer Mark Twain thought him almost demonically possessed; in a letter to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Alta California&lt;/em&gt; in 1869, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All the schooling of a life-time could not teach a man to do this wonderful thing, I suppose – but this, blind, uninstructed idiot of nineteen does it without any trouble. Some archangel, cast out of upper Heaven like another Satan, inhabits this coarse casket … It is not Blind Tom that does these wonderful things and plays this wonderful music – it is the other party.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, a tension existed around the (impossible) figure of this incredibly talented blind Black man who referred to himself in the third person and clapped eccentrically during his performances. In a society that placed social status on an individual’s innate gift, attempts such as Twain’s to ascribe Wiggins’s talent to something else were strategies to explain away phenomena that did not fit the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/V-Qq0o1S4vo" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one of the explanations put forward to explain Wiggins’s skill directly invoked his Blackness. In the mid-&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century,&lt;/span&gt; rhythm was understood to be corporeal, not intellectual, linked more to impulse and sensuality than to reason, largely on the grounds of believing that children, idiots and Black people all exhibited an easy appreciation of music, despite their savage, uncivilised natures. In pointedly racial tones, white Americans argued that Black people possessed an ‘innate musicality’, invoking musical ability as a way to perpetuate notions of essential difference. Similarly, Séguin promoted the use of music as a pedagogical tool that might stimulate the senses and develop the attentional focus of idiots, while noting that ‘their taste is of the popular or coloured kind’. Wiggins, a Black disabled man, confirmed these racially skewed ideas on two counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince the Enlightenment, when the intellectual order was understood to mirror the social order, talented intellectually disabled individuals posed a problem for understanding the human mind and for naturalising social difference. This is particularly evident in the case of arithmetical ability. Outside of the universitites, it was considered a niche acquisition with little intellectual prestige, restricted mainly to the mercantile sector; but, with the spread of commercialisation, arithmetic became more important and was commonly seen as a marker of the power of reason. Prestigious mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss in Europe and Nathaniel Bowditch in the US, renowned for their prodigious abilities, became symbols of Enlightenment genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were other 18th-century figures, like Jedediah Buxton in England and Thomas Fuller, an enslaved African in Virginia, who could neither read nor write but who demonstrated exceptional calculating skills. For Enlightenment men of science, such individuals offered an insight into the workings of the mind while at the same time posing a threat to the order of society. How could men like Buxton and Fuller be paragons of reason if they couldn’t hold a conversation? Their answer leant on the science of mind to explain that savant-like skill signified an exceptionally developed faculty of memory, and was not a real marker of reason. In the developmental theory of the time, memory was one of the first (and therefore less sophisticated) faculties to develop. As a result, these men of science used cognitive difference as a way to legitimise social hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;These practices once again denied intellectually disabled people the possibility of creativity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As medical science shifted in the 19th century towards an anatomo-clinical model, explanations for phenomena of the mind became increasingly rooted in the body – specifically, the brain and the nervous system. Idiocy shifted towards being understood as the product of brain lesions or deformities. When it came to the idiot savant, physicians theorised that their talent was due to brain protrusions and an uneven growth of the organ of the mind, in line with phrenological theories that claimed that the brain was divided into separate sections, each representing a distinct quality or ability that could be measured by studying the skull. Wherever possible, autopsies were carried out on the brains of idiot savants to find out if the cerebral tissue could shed more light on their unexpected talent. Some doctors theorised that the idiot savant would lose their special skill if they developed the rest of their brain functions to restore a more balanced state of mind, since their talent was caused by unequal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices once again denied intellectually disabled people the possibility of creativity: their abilities were ascribed instead to a pathology of brain or mind, or else explained away as nothing more than excellent imitation skills. ‘There is no spontaneous invention,’ affirmed the US neurologist Frederick Peterson in 1896: ‘The &lt;em&gt;idiot savants&lt;/em&gt; are mere copyists in music, modelling, designing, or painting.’ Of course, imitation and repetition are central to the development of any skill, but men such as Peterson invoked these behaviours as a way of denying creativity to savants. Since creativity was so tightly linked to the soul, Peterson and his kind reinforced the idea that idiot savants were not fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n a groundbreaking paper in 1943, the Austrian-American psychologist Leo Kanner described autism as being characterised by aloneness, a fixation with objects and the repetition of actions (like writing the same word over and over or shaking their head from side to side), as well as a preference for routines and for their surroundings to stay the same. Atypical cases Kanner discussed in his paper included children who could recognise composers and squirm in pleasure at their music by the age of one and a half, count to 100 by the age of two, sing a substantial repertoire before the age of three, and who had a remarkable ability to spell and complete arithmetic as a memory feat by the age of eight. Kanner argued that these children were born with an innate talent and a unique way of looking at the world. At a time when ideas about intellectual disability were opening up to psychoanalytical and social interpretations, Kanner’s description of children with autism gave room for imagination and uniqueness, while still defending the idea that their brains were wired differently, genetically and neurologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savantism continues to fascinate us to this day. Even now, when we operate with the more inclusive category of neurodivergence as opposed to pathology, savantism’s rarity and precocity invite interest. We marvel at Stephen Wiltshire’s ability to draw large cityscapes from memory, or at Leslie Lemke’s ability to play a complex piece of music after listening to it just once. But marvelling has itself been problematised as a form of othering. Kim Peek’s exceptional memory skills might have made him the inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; (1988), but the film’s portrayal of Raymond Babbitt (Peek’s avatar) as an infantilised incompetent has drawn pointed criticism from the neurodivergent community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The savant is still a rare curio, even if the neurological context in which we comprehend them has changed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part, the disability community has expressed frustration over the cultural over-representation of exceptionally talented autistic figures for creating harmful stereotypes that render invisible those people with disabilities who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exceptionally talented. Turning a historical lens on savantism is telling in revealing precisely how at different times we conceive and police ideas about who can be creative in different ways. What becomes evident in the rear-view mirror is that the medical discourse around savantism was not primarily about health, or even the sciences of the mind, but rather about politics and power(lessness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we no longer brand idiot savants as monstrous, it remains a moot question how far we’ve really come. We still trip over this almost voyeuristic idea of exceptional, unexpected talent that make such figures inexplicable and intriguing. The savant is still a rare curio, even if the neurological context in which we comprehend them has changed. Disability scholars such as Joseph N Straus and Marion Quirici point out that merely by asking how exceptional talent can appear alongside disability, we reproduce social views that present disabled individuals as ‘Others’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the argument cuts two ways. Studies in psychology that comprehend talent as intrinsic to neurodivergent conditions such as autism spectrum disorder have given rise to a popular narrative that sees genius as innate, leading people to speak of disabled savants with so much awe and admiration that they become ‘supercrips’ – people who overcome their disability through their mysterious inborn talent. But this supposedly positive take still styles disabled people as being ‘not like us’. Otherworldly is still Other, and it imposes the need to be ‘more than’ in order to be accepted. As many disability advocates argue, these narratives of overcoming compound the idea that a disability is something negative, while obstructing the discomfiting subversive agency that disabled individuals can tap into through their very existence. To the extent that we still struggle to comprehend neurological complexity, the figure of the ‘idiot savant’ is a reminder that we need to do better at unpicking, processing and accepting difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:03:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTkFJQ1BtMlVjajN0bEdIeDdvS3JTeFZTekVNOFB2bFVaVlJUbURyLXN1TXdGX2JsWDFJWW5PXzFVTkM0V3VIaWF0azlNRE5fWEVta3lJbGpEdVcwTFZLVTR1Rk9SNDBvMnhRZjNWSFVVRmdNMlVLTGJRS1NDRF9IX3lmNW5ZWTRTSWc</guid></item><item><title>以科学为后盾的步骤，将烤肉的癌症风险降低高达90 ％ - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/backed-science-step-cuts-cancer-090100706.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilling meat at high temperatures can produce carcinogenic compounds, but marinating before cooking can reduce those chemicals by more than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marinades that include ingredients like vinegar, citrus, wine, yogurt, and antioxidant-rich herbs such as garlic, rosemary, and thyme are the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts advise pairing grilled meats with fruits and vegetables to help counteract harmful compounds and decrease long-term cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilled meat certainly makes for a great dinner.

Fortunately, there's a very simple — and delicious — way to reduce that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/grilling-meat-raises-cancer-risk-here-are-ways-lower-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCLA Health Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCLA Health Center&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:numerous studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;numerous studies&lt;/a&gt;) explains, "eating meat cooked over high temperatures can increase the risk of cancer" because it can char the meat, which "produces carcinogenic chemicals known as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons." The more you're exposed to these chemicals, the more damage they can do to your DNA, and "over time can develop into tumors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there are many ways to reduce your risk, such as not overcooking your meat, trimming off charred areas, and turning your meat frequently while cooking over an open flame, experts also recommend one more tasty option: marinating your meat first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/condiments/marinades/marinades" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 Marinade Recipes for Ultimate Flavor Infusion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;16 Marinade Recipes for Ultimate Flavor Infusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marinades can significantly reduce the carcinogenic compounds formed in grilling or cooking meats at high temperatures.

The study also found that the longer you marinate, the better the results; however, excessive time in marinades can alter the meat's texture, so it's best to keep the marination time to 24 hours or less.

But left untreated, even for a short time, the outcome can be catastrophic. Newborns who contract infections from their mothers during pregnancy or delivery can develop irreversible problems, such as blindness, deafness and bone deformities â€” or even die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Experts say there are a variety of factors at play, including a reluctance by some health care providers to broach the subject in the exam room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;â€œProviders are incredibly uncomfortable in talking to patients about sex,â€� said Barbara Wilgus, a Johns Hopkins nurse specializing in sexually transmitted infections who also sees patients in the city. â€œI know this as a provider and a patient. In all my years going to the doctor, the times Iâ€™ve actually been asked about it is so low.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The outbreak could also become a strain on public coffers. A test for a pregnant woman costs about $8, but care for a child with congenital syphilis can skyrocket. Significantly delaying treatment for an affected child leads to medical costs averaging more than $650,000 per infant, according to an analysis of data from the stateâ€™s Medicaid program, which pays for about 40% of all births in Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;City health officials acknowledge the severity of the problem crept up on them, and are now rushing to test and treat more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;â€œWe went through the pandemic, and our eye was not on congenital syphilis,â€� said Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection in adults, with 190,000 cases last year, federal data show. In the earliest stage, it can look like a single sore where the bacteria entered the body. Tracking the infectionâ€™s progress then gets tricky, as it develops into a rash and cold-like symptoms for some, or remains largely invisible, with no symptoms, for others. If it is unaddressed for years, syphilis can damage the brain and other vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;While Baltimoreâ€˜s rate far surpasses the nationâ€˜s, U.S cases in newborns are also at a record high â€” nearly 4,000 cases â€” despite a drop in adult infections, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html"&gt;2024 federal data&lt;/a&gt; released last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;By the end of 2023, the cityâ€™s rate of congenital syphilis was nearly four times the state and national average of just over 100 for every 100,000 births. (In Baltimore, the infection rate for adults is similarly outsized compared with the rest of the country, clocking in at roughly four times the national rate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Dr. Adena Greenbaum, assistant Baltimore health commissioner of clinical services and HIV/STI prevention, described the cityâ€™s efforts to bring down syphilis in babies as â€œa high priority.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Itâ€™s an alarming turn for an infection that was almost eliminated in the 1990s. Officials say infections also are causing a significant number of miscarriages and stillbirths. Public health officials cite a mix of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Once a major problem only for men who have sex with men, syphilis now infects more women of child-bearing years, a trend exacerbated by the rise in drug use. Experts say that in Baltimore, the infections disproportionately affect lower-income Black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Some women tell their doctors that they were unaware of their often-painless&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;infections&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with no visible symptoms. Other expectant mothers did not receive prenatal care or even routine care that might have flagged an infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In other cases, doctors werenâ€™t uniformly performing the blood tests or werenâ€™t understanding or passing on results. And some women were treated only to be reinfected by their partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;A national shortage of the antibiotic recommended for pregnant women further complicated the response, forcing some providers to spend time scrambling for doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In response, city health officials tapped&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;state funding to create a &lt;a href="https://www.healthybabiesbaltimore.com/congenital-syphilis" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.healthybabiesbaltimore.com/congenital-syphilis"&gt;public communications plan&lt;/a&gt; designed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs to encourage more pregnant women to get tested. The city sent extra staff to three local hospital emergency rooms to educate pregnant women about syphilis and how to &lt;a href="https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/michelle-taylor-baltimore-health-commissioner-ONSPZHGRHNCHFEHYMGHS73IQGQ/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/michelle-taylor-baltimore-health-commissioner-ONSPZHGRHNCHFEHYMGHS73IQGQ/"&gt;get tested.&lt;/a&gt; And starting Oct. 13, the cityâ€™s sexual health clinic will be moved to Saratoga Street from the cityâ€™s North Avenue building that has long been in disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Dr. Jeanne Sheffield, an infectious disease expert and professor of gynecology and obstetrics in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said some women may resist testing because they donâ€™t feel sick or donâ€™t think they could be infected. But she recommends universal testing for all mothers throughout their pregnancies so they donâ€™t miss new cases or reinfections, and early use of antibiotics can prevent transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Today across Maryland, health care providers must test the pregnant women they see for syphilis in addition to HIV, according to state law. Syphilis in babies, according to Sheffield, is markedly different from other sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea or chlamydia because of how serious and irreversible its complications can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Wilgus, who also is a program administrator for the STD/HIV Prevention Training Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, said she finds women who make it to a doctor are typically willing to do what it takes for a healthy pregnancy. Often their partners are, too, so a test generally isnâ€™t a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The bigger challenge, she said, is convincing health providers to discuss sexual health with all of their patients as part of their normal routine. That would likely reduce stigma around STIs and promote more testing for all patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;City and state officials say they are now working in earnest to reduce infections. The key, according to Dr. Meena Seshamani, Marylandâ€™s health secretary, is making sure patients â€œcan get access to the services they need and that itâ€™s a safe space where they can talk about things that are more sensitive.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Baltimore Banner</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOZ1owOHlQQ0ltQ0o0MzBGMGpidlJtaXpWeUUzdzRTQlc4M2c1SXVRUms4NzdhV1JVNUVRdEtjRWRXdkc2OWt6bEJTeHNyUEtNS0kzcWFqN0ZLSVpHQngzRWxoMkFYY3dvMTU3dGNfZkR6cWNxMmkzRi1YSXZGeEYwVE5yUEpMX2JKTklBcXdRLThxaHdHWlplMnFSeFZ5OVJySUtiMlB6OUUwT3djRVF0TU5LanlTTzQ</guid></item><item><title>这个简单的腌制技巧可以使烤肉更安全—并将癌症风险降低90 ％ -食品和葡萄酒</title><link>https://www.foodandwine.com/how-marinades-reduce-cancer-risk-11803529</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grilling meat at high temperatures can produce carcinogenic compounds, but marinating before cooking can reduce those chemicals by more than 90%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marinades that include ingredients like vinegar, citrus, wine, yogurt, and antioxidant-rich herbs such as garlic, rosemary, and thyme are the most effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts advise pairing grilled meats with fruits and vegetables to help counteract harmful compounds and decrease long-term cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grilled meat certainly makes for a great dinner. However, there's one side effect that no one wants as a side dish: an &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/do-grilled-foods-cause-cancer" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, there's a very simple — and delicious — way to reduce that risk.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/grilling-meat-raises-cancer-risk-here-are-ways-lower-it" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;UCLA Health Center&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;numerous studies&lt;/a&gt;) explains, "eating meat cooked over high temperatures can increase the risk of cancer" because it can char the meat, which "produces carcinogenic chemicals known as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons." The more you're exposed to these chemicals, the more damage they can do to your DNA, and "over time can develop into tumors." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while there are many ways to reduce your risk, such as not overcooking your meat, trimming off charred areas, and turning your meat frequently while cooking over an open flame, experts also recommend one more tasty option: marinating your meat first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Marinades can significantly reduce the carcinogenic compounds formed in grilling or cooking meats at high temperatures. Even marinating meat for as little as 40 minutes seems to reduce these compounds by over 90%," the &lt;a href="https://www.karmanos.org/karmanos/documents-and-links/marinades-for-grilling-7361" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karmanos Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Wayne State University explained. The institute noted that it's unclear why marinades seem to be so protective, but it could be due to the antioxidants in the marinade or because it gives a "simple cooling effect of marinades on meat."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The spices and herbs not only make your meat more flavorful, but their antioxidant properties may prevent the formation of harmful carcinogenic compounds."

The study also found that the longer you marinate, the better the results; however, excessive time in marinades can alter the meat's texture, so it's best to keep the marination time to 24 hours or less. Additionally, it found that the most effective ingredients for reducing harmful chemicals include acids such as vinegar, citrus juice, wine, and yogurt, as well as herbs and spices like garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme, and oregano.

They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use butter, olive oil, or other fats, and avoid direct exposure to the pan or heat source when cooking meat or fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce cooking temperature and cooking time whenever possible to reduce carcinogen formation. According to the researchers, the most effective method is to pre-cook the meat in the microwave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly flip your meat over an open flame to minimize carcinogen formation and prevent the meat from overheating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use both "natural and synthetic antioxidants" to neutralize free radicals. Think of herbs and spices like garlic, ginger, pepper, tomato, and onion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply flavorings and marinades before cooking to further reduce your risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an air fryer, infrared oven, or sous vide whenever possible to minimize charring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The main point isn't to worry too much about your meats, as long as you aren't charring every meal every single day. “It's not so much a one-time experience, such as an occasion where you kept your meat on the grill too long and it turned black.

As the birds travel, they mingle at lakes and ponds and share viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-631cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;In poultry, bird flu cases are spiking earlier than expected. More than 4 million poultry birds have been culled in the last month, in states including Minnesota and Iowa, after members of their flock tested positive for the virus, called H5N1. The trend corresponds to a spike in infections detected among wild birds in northern states.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc86c1" class="body-graf"&gt;Some state officials are bracing for a challenging autumn, which is when cases have typically spiked in past years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9adf09" class="body-graf"&gt;“Last week, we had our first confirmed positive,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said. The case was on a turkey farm in Calhoun County. “The question for us then is how extensive will it be and what kind of fall will we have.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fb556" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too early to say what effect the outbreaks will have on egg prices, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7072b" class="body-graf"&gt;“The only honest answer to that is we will have to see. I wish I could give you more than that,” Naig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0384be" class="body-graf"&gt;This is the fourth fall in which bird flu infections have risen, a sign the virus is becoming endemic in wild birds and could be a continual threat to poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fc3a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not going away. It seems pretty embedded,” Voss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87f1fe" class="body-graf"&gt;The more the virus circulates, there is a risk that it will unlock a way to readily infect humans. If that becomes a problem, some experts fear that the Trump administration’s cuts to mRNA research could hamper scientists’ ability to rapidly develop a new vaccine. For now, though, the health risk to people remains low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a7726" class="body-graf"&gt;As fall progresses, officials, wildlife experts and virologists are in a watch-and-wait mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aafb3e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s an interesting time,” said Declan Schroeder, an associate professor of virology at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what’s going to happen.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f49634" class="body-graf"&gt;Avian influenza was first detected in a U.S. commercial flock in February 2022, after circulating in wild birds before then. The virus is almost always deadly for poultry birds, and as of this summer, more than 175 million birds had been culled or killed. Two years ago, researchers were &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-cases-spread-warning-signs-rcna185084" target="_blank"&gt;surprised to discover that bird flu had spread to dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; and was found in raw, unpasteurized milk, prompting a slew of changes to farm practices and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usda-orders-testing-milk-bird-flu-rcna183212" target="_blank"&gt;milk testing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5aec88" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;At least 70 people&lt;/a&gt; — mostly farmworkers with close contact to birds or cows — have been infected. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/first-human-bird-flu-death-us-louisiana-rcna186466" target="_blank"&gt;One person died&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ce388" class="body-graf"&gt;Wild birds tend to spread the disease to poultry farms in a few ways, scientists think: through direct contact, by contaminating feed or when workers bring contaminated materials into barns. That’s why migration season can be such a catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f0bea" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you got one sick bird that moves over an area, infects some others, the math suggests it’s going to spread really fast,” said Michael Ward, a professor of natural resources and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois, who studies migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14b26b" class="body-graf"&gt;Ward added that habitat limitations are pushing birds to congregate and share space, which makes viral spread more likely. In Illinois, wetland habitat has shrunk as the state deals with drought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e96945" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a perfect combination for disease to pop up,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-305474" class="body-graf"&gt;In response to an inquiry about the rise in bird flu detections and how the federal government plans to deal with it, the U.S. Department of Agriculture pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/03/20/usda-update-progress-five-pronged-strategy-combat-avian-flu-and-lower-egg-prices" target="_blank"&gt;five-prong strategy it released in February&lt;/a&gt;, which included $100 million for research into new biosecurity measures and vaccine development for poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b2ad3" class="body-graf"&gt;Countries like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/bird-flu/bird-flu-egg-prices-vaccines-chickens-raw-milk-what-know-rcna193916" target="_blank"&gt;France are already vaccinating poultry birds&lt;/a&gt;, but the USDA said it continues to evaluate whether the U.S. should do so. The agency has not approved such a vaccine, and rolling one out would affect U.S. exports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c222f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We really do believe that an effective vaccine strategy would be very helpful for the egg and turkey producers, but we understand that has to be carefully done to ensure there’s not an impact to other markets,” Naig, in Iowa, said. “USDA has put some focus on this and now we’re awaiting what that vaccine strategy could look like.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf57e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have long been concerned that the bird flu virus might eventually develop the ability to spread effectively between people. Even given the low risk to humans at the moment, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies infectious diseases, advised people to take basic steps to prevent infection with H5N1 as well as the seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7565ff" class="body-graf"&gt;“Get your flu shot. Don’t drink raw milk, don’t eat unpasteurized cheese, particularly when cases are circulating. Don’t let your cats feed outside when it’s migratory bird season,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a71a84" class="body-graf"&gt;A scenario in which a person gets infected with both H5N1 and seasonal flu at the same time could be problematic because it would enable the bird flu virus to more easily rearrange its genetic code to suit humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50e4c4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped holding coordination calls on H5N1 with health providers this spring — a change Chin-Hong laments. He hopes the agency will resume the calls, and he disagrees with the Trump administration’s termination of mRNA vaccine research funding. The biotech company Moderna was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281" target="_blank"&gt;developing a bird flu vaccine that used the mRNA platform&lt;/a&gt;, but the Department of Health and Human Services canceled its grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11bfeb" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOY0s3aURIZ1Z5eUlPSlZxdFhuNzNJM01Qb3dEdllSRlBwWGd1MWxhZG5MS09DWmFUNHB4dk5kTGJWa203U3hiM0lyemx3UHphVEh1dUlVTHBaOGpkVmJOc2hfc1o3bGJjbTRMdVdtOXA4TkRsRExRRjM0ZDE2YmJHeVRoT0HSAVZBVV95cUxNZmdCXzNHQnZCWE5zRnNXM3llaFBoUkhwMUhuSENzWms0VGxyandLWV9WZGtoeHp4eDl1YlZtS1BuR3ZfR0ZFc3hpeG5TalZLVnJrUlZTdw</guid></item><item><title>氯胺酮可以帮助抑郁症、创伤后应激障碍的第一反应者吗？基本上不受监管的治疗面临障碍。- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ketamine-first-responders-depression-ptsd-treatment/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting "988."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asheville, North Carolina&lt;/em&gt; — A few months ago, Waynesville Police Sgt. Paige Shell was about to give up hope of getting better. The daily drip of violence, death, and misery from almost 20 years in law enforcement had left a mark. Her sleep was poor, depression was a stubborn companion, and thoughts of suicide had taken root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell, who works in a rural community about 30 miles west of Asheville, tried talk therapy, but it didn't work. When her counselor suggested &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/what-is-ketamine/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ketamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-assisted psychotherapy, she was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know what to expect. I'm a cop. It's a trust thing," she said with a thin smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining psychotherapy with low-dose ketamine, a hallucinogenic drug long used as an anesthetic, is a relatively new approach to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/ketamine-treatment-for-depression-gaining-popularity-in-u-s/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;treating severe depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and post-traumatic stress, especially in populations with high trauma rates such as firefighters, police officers, and military members. Yet evidence of the efficacy and safety of ketamine for treatment of mental health conditions is still evolving, and the market remains widely unregulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"First responders experience a disproportionately high burden of trauma and are often left without a lot of treatment options," said Signi Goldman, a psychiatrist and co-owner of &lt;a href="https://conciergemedicineandpsychiatry.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Concierge Medicine and Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; in Asheville, who began including ketamine in psychotherapy sessions in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officers in the U.S., on average, are exposed to 189 traumatic events over their careers, a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.21996" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;small study suggests&lt;/a&gt;, compared with two to three in an average adult's lifetime. Research shows that rates of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7221164/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;depression and burnout&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/white_papers/the-ruderman-white-paper-update-on-mental-health-and-suicide-of-first-responders/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;significantly higher&lt;/a&gt; among police officers than in the civilian population. And in recent years, more officers have died by suicide than been killed in the line of duty, according to the first-responder advocacy group &lt;a href="https://1sthelp.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;First H.E.L.P.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine is a dissociative drug, meaning it causes people to feel detached from their body, physical environment, thoughts, or emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved it as an anesthetic in 1970. It became a popular party drug in the 1990s, and in 1999, ketamine was added to the list of Schedule III nonnarcotic substances under the Controlled Substances Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/ketamine-queen-jasveen-sangha-pleads-guilty-matthew-perry-death/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;death of "Friends" actor Matthew Perry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2023, which was &lt;a href="https://me.lacounty.gov/2023/press-releases/cause-and-manner-of-death-determined-for-matthew-langford-perry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;attributed to ketamine use&lt;/a&gt;, further tainted the drug's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But starting with a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001429999090204J?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1990 animal study&lt;/a&gt; and followed by a landmark &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10686270/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;human trial&lt;/a&gt;, research has shown that low doses of ketamine can also rapidly reduce symptoms of depression. In 2019, the FDA &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ketamine-for-depression-approved-by-fda-today-2019-03-05/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;approved esketamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — derived from ketamine and administered as a nasal spray — for treatment-resistant depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All other forms of ketamine remain FDA-approved only for anesthesia. If used to treat psychiatric disorders, it must be prescribed off-label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a situation where the clinical practice is probably ahead of the evidence to support it," said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/john-krystal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;John Krystal&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and a pioneer of ketamine research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krystal has &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01266-9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studied the effect&lt;/a&gt; of ketamine on veterans and active-duty military members — a population comparable to first responders in their exposure to trauma. While research shows strong evidence of ketamine's antidepressant effects, he said further studies are needed on its potential role in PTSD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulatory environment for ketamine also remains a concern, Krystal said. State oversight varies, and federal regulations don't outline dosing, administration methods, safety protocols, or training for providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this regulatory patchwork, more than &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-ketamine-therapy-booms-industry-insiders-worry-about-patient-safety-5ffd7b89" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1,000 ketamine clinics&lt;/a&gt; have sprung up across the country. At-home ketamine treatments have flooded the market, prompting the FDA to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/fda-warns-patients-and-health-care-providers-about-potential-risks-associated-compounded-ketamine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;issue a warning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects of ketamine can range from nausea and blood pressure spikes to suppressed breathing. The drug can also cause adverse psychological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being on a psychedelic puts people in an extremely vulnerable state," Goldman said. People can get retraumatized as they relive disturbing memories. That's why it's critical that a mental health provider guide a person through a ketamine session, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With proper precautions — and when other treatments have failed — Rick Baker thinks ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is a good fit for first responders. Baker is CEO and founder of Responder Support Services, which provides mental health treatment exclusively to police officers, firefighters, and other first responders in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a population, first responders are more resistant than civilians to traditional therapy, said Baker, who is a licensed clinical mental health counselor. Ketamine provides a potential shortcut into the trauma memory and works "like an accelerant to psychotherapy," he said. "It strips away people's armor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When used for mental health treatment, a dose of ketamine — typically half a milligram per kilogram of body weight, less than for anesthesia — creates a mildly altered state of consciousness, Goldman said. It makes people look at their own traumatic memories at a distance "and tolerate them differently," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ketamine sessions in her practice are usually two hours long, and clients are under the drug for about 45 minutes. The drug is administered as an IV drip, an intramuscular injection, under-the-tongue lozenges, or a compounded nasal spray. The drug is short-acting, meaning its dissociative effects largely wear off within about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most insurers won't pick up the cost of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, which can be more than $1,000 per session for the IV drip.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's certainly prohibitive for first responders," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Veterans Affairs &lt;a href="https://www.va.gov/formularyadvisor/DOC_PDF/CRE_Ketamine_Infusion_for_Treatment_Resistant_Depression_Rev_Jul_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;covers some forms of ketamine&lt;/a&gt; treatment, including ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, for eligible veterans on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shell's case, a donation made to Responder Support Services covered what her insurance wouldn't when she decided this spring to try ketamine-assisted psychotherapy with Baker, her counselor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revisiting the most gruesome calls in her nearly two decades as a police officer was not something Shell wanted to do. But Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic flooding in western North Carolina last year, pushed the 41-year-old "over the edge," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the sessions were rough," said Shell, who is also a member of her agency's SWAT team. "Things came up that I didn't want to think about, that I'd buried during my entire career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The badly mangled victim in a fatal car crash. A murder-suicide, in which a man cut his pregnant girlfriend's throat then slit his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under ketamine, the images came to life as still pictures, she said, like a surreal slideshow replaying some of her darkest memories. "Then I would sit there and cry like a baby."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early October, Shell had undergone 12 ketamine sessions. They have not provided a sudden miraculous cure, she said. But her sleep has improved, and bad days are now bad moments. She also finds it easier to manage stress. "And I smile more than I used to," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was hesitant to share her experience within her department because of the ongoing stigma associated with seeking help in the hard-charging police culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just didn't want my people to think that I couldn't handle the job," she said. "I didn't want them to feel that I'm posing a risk to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perception of ketamine plays a role as well, said Sherri Martin, national director of wellness services at the &lt;a href="https://fop.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Fraternal Order of Police&lt;/a&gt;, an organization representing more than 377,000 sworn law enforcement officers. Many cops are used to ketamine as an illegal street drug, she said, or think of it as a counterculture psychedelic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, when they are supposed to accept this as a treatment, that's hard for them to grasp," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few if any police departments provide clear guidance on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. If it were medically prescribed, it would likely be viewed the same as taking an antidepressant, Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell ultimately shared her story with colleagues, most of whom were curious and supportive, and she now encourages other officers to speak up about their struggles. She believes seeking mental health treatment — in her case, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy — has made her a better and safer police officer.&lt;/p&gt;

"Some chemicals are better established than others, and more widely accepted in the medical community, but almost certainly there are others that have not been studied rigorously and potentially are even more deleterious &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to our health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to our health&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz noted that the study suggests Parkinson’s disease may be linked not only to advanced age, but also to the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to neurotoxins — which could help explain why the disease often develops later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding TCE exposure can be challenging, Ellenbogen noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is likely some benefit to using medical-grade air purifiers, filtering water and avoiding plastic water bottles, which may contribute to lowering risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Previous research has found that TCE, when inhaled or ingested, can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to neurons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Krzyzanowski encourages individuals to be aware of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; linking TCE exposure to Parkinson’s disease risk and to check to see whether the chemical has contaminated their own community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If so, there are ways to volunteer and get involved with community groups concerning environmental advocacy and remediation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was supported in part by the American Academy of Neurology and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to several manufacturers of TCE for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/parkinsons-risk-could-increase-exposure-common-chemical-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parkinson’s risk could increase with exposure to common chemical, study suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parkinson’s risk could increase with exposure to common chemical, study suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:33:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNcElfYlpWYkxDT0ZWVTc0QkxRaDNKYXc3MTEyak5ZdjZaOXNHMzJfZUVxZlJYejdZSnVaRTdUZUdrZUdqcTliQUdlVllMZ1RhY1VrcmgxTjlGV2FqZTNQc1luZU1tRGFBYld3NHB0dmhMd09xaUZoV2lRSl9oam9JTUhLNkE</guid></item></channel></rss>
