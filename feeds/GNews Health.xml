Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research reveals","elementId":"180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/18/artificial-intelligence-uk-emotional-support-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/18/warning-ai-chatbots-inaccurate-financial-advice-tips-chatgpt-copilot-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;gave inaccurate financial advice&lt;/a&gt;, while similar concerns have been raised about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5ggew08eyo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summaries of news stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Typing “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:17,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQXBwR0FUdTRWaVBla050WU9xQW9YMDlERXdOc2hnZ0pLS2FBbjhmMmZaZ1ZKSTZNTUdMekc1ZmZWcExJaGRTVFctYm94dHlJZVNOOWJhOVdFcVdrVWx0RjZuSzhmeEdxbVRsRElfNDdMUERxVHNic293NVMyT1N2aDlRT09KMnY0NHkwODZlUzYwNjVtVDFtdlkyZ2JxWS1KMWwwRU1nTXRTNGk4a3dv</guid></item><item><title>专家遵循6条长寿规则，在2026年实现更健康的衰老-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/health/6-longevity-rules-experts-follow-healthier-aging-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!

                &lt;p&gt;The influenza season is in full swing, and it’s already proving to be deadly for some of the most vulnerable Americans around: children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several states have reported their first pediatric flu deaths this week. Cases and hospitalizations are rising across the country as well, while some areas are experiencing record-level surges of illness. The season is being driven by the emergence of an unexpected strain of the H3N2 flu, named subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tragic deaths&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to the holidays, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;most current flu data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is nearly two weeks old. Yet it’s still evident that this season is gearing up to be a nasty one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of December 20, flu activity was high or very high in 32 regions of the U.S. and moderate in eight other jurisdictions. The cumulative flu hospitalization rate in week 51 was also the third highest it’s been at this point in the past 15 years (the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons were the other two).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things have been even worse for some states. Last week, for example, New York health officials &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-26_flu_cases.htm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; experiencing the largest weekly surge in flu cases ever recorded in modern history—71,123 positive flu cases during the week of December 20.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At least eight pediatric flu deaths this winter have also been recorded by the CDC so far, though local health officials and members of the public have documented more since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On December 30, for instance, the Kentucky Department for Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/News/Documents/Kentucky%20Reports%201st%20Pediatric%20Influenza%20Death%20This%20Respiratory%20Virus%20Season.pdf"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its first pediatric flu death of the 2025-26 season: a child from Kenton County who did not receive a flu vaccination. The next day, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/first-pediatric-flu-death-123125"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its first pediatric flu death, which involved a teenager from Greene County. And on Thursday, Paul Kim, a popular social media influencer and Minnesota resident, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/catholic-influencers-5-year-old-son-dies-contracting-flu-rcna251834"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that his five-year-old son died after contracting a severe bout of flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This death is tragic and our hearts go out to the family,” said Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health, in a &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/first-pediatric-flu-death-123125"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It also reminds us that influenza, though common, is a serious health threat, and we urge parents to protect their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A record bad winter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even during a typical winter, the seasonal flu will sicken millions of Americans, hospitalize hundreds of thousands, and kill tens of thousands. But it’s certainly possible that we could be in for two straight bad seasons in a row. Last winter, at least 280 children in the U.S. died of the flu, the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/more-kids-are-dying-from-seasonal-flu-than-ever-2000668078"&gt;highest death toll&lt;/a&gt; in children for a non-pandemic flu seen in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This season is being fueled by the emergence of subclade K, an H3N2 variant noticeably different on a genetic level from the flu strains scientists predicted would be circulating this season. Since its arrival toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, K has quickly taken over as the leading cause of flu cases worldwide, including in the U.S. Though the variant doesn’t appear to cause &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586"&gt;more severe infections&lt;/a&gt; on average than other H3N2 strains, it has caused strong, early, or prolonged waves of illness in various parts of the world, including the &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/12/02/japan/science-health/flu-season/"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701333/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to subclade K, it’s still worth getting your shot if you haven’t already. Data from the UK has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D." target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that vaccination this season is still effective at preventing serious flu complications, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But if losing belly fat is one of your resolutions and you think that &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; is the key, then it’s time to think again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The single best thing we can do for ourselves is exercising. It works on almost all diseases we can measure – but not for weight loss,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/research-groups/clemmensen-group/?pure=en/persons/293530"&gt;Professor Christoffer Clemmensen&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Basic Metabolic Research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, studies have repeatedly shown the “eat less; move more” mantra parroted to those looking to lose &lt;a href="/topic/body-fat"&gt;body fat&lt;/a&gt; is ineffective. And nor is willpower the vital key that many people believe it to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Weight loss is not a matter of willpower,” adds his colleague, PhD fellow Valdemar Brimnes Ingemann Johansen. “It’s critical to acknowledge the powerful biological mechanisms that interact with your environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic predisposition is a big determinant of our body size and how we look – and this powerful biology that underlies our body size is often beyond an individual’s control.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair are responsible for a recent literature review, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/s0092-8674(25)00677-4"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; journal, which dives deep into this topic. Here, they reveal more about the lesser-known mechanisms behind weight loss that might just help you achieve your goals this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with a calorie deficit &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calorie is a unit of energy – more specifically, one kilocalorie is the estimated amount of energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1C. Since the 19th century, this has been the most common unit of measurement used for listing energy in food and drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calorie deficit is the common denominator behind weight loss, and so it is widely prescribed to people looking to lose body fat, presenting the idea that if you expend more calories than you consume, you will create a negative energy balance and lose weight. This fact is not disputed by our experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone can lose weight if you put them in a restrictive environment,” says Professor Clemmensen. “It’s the laws of thermodynamics and it will work on everyone; if you have a negative energy balance, you will lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you can’t tell people to stay in a negative energy balance in the free world, because you have these strong biological forces that are telling people to eat. Unless you can restrict your meal size, or you have someone to put a lock on your cabinets, it’s just impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Calorie deficit comments disregard the power of biology underlying weight control. It’s like telling people who are stressed to relax, or telling people who have psychological illnesses to just get their act together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/nutrionist-healthy-longevity-diet-b2862364.html"&gt;What foods nutrition experts really eat to stop chronic illness in old age (and always avoid)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hjimhY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/22/46/iStock-2196789730.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/22/46/iStock-2196789730.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/22/46/iStock-2196789730.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A calorie deficit will cause you to lose weight, but studies suggest the results do not last long-term" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-317570"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A calorie deficit will cause you to lose weight, but studies suggest the results do not last long-term&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The new science behind weight loss &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is classified as a chronic, relapsing disease by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, with the institution reporting: “In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why would our bodies contain “strong biological forces” to promote or protect a condition linked to ill &lt;a href="/topic/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;? The answer, according to Johansen, lies with our predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stored fat would have helped our human ancestors stave off starvation when food was scarce, so the body “remembers” it and tries to replenish these stores when food becomes available, he says. As part of this, the body treats weight loss like a threat, fighting it by releasing a flood of hunger hormones and heightening food cravings while reducing our energy expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, this might have been helpful; in the 21st century, where energy-dense foods are more accessible than ever and movement is optional, these impulses can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Clemmensen led a 2025 literature review on this topic, which found evidence to support the presence of what he describes as an “obesity memory”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This idea about memory of obesity is a little bit elusive," he says. “We don’t know where that memory is stored, but you can see it’s there. If you look at studies where people have undergone extreme weight loss, most of them will find their way back quite accurately to their original weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There seems to be a very specific memory, for want of a better term, of what your weight was. That’s what we’re working on in our lab to try to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of this memory will, as with most things in the human body, vary from person to person depending on factors such as genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How much people are able to sustain lost body fat and how they will respond to different types of interventions – both behavioural and pharmacological, like weight loss drugs – will depend on the person,” Johansen explains. “We see quite some variability among people when we look at big clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting, and very valuable, if we could understand more about what makes one person regain all their lost bodyweight in just a couple of months, while another person is able to sustain their weight loss for years. This is probably, if I am allowed to speculate, down to the interaction between the environment that person is living in and their genetic make-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/running-marathon-hyrox-endurance-sport-b2847344.html"&gt;Is the rise of endurance sports a harmless health kick – or dangerous addiction to adventure?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 YIVyy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/19/10/newFile-4.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/19/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/19/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Someone’s ability to achieve and sustain weight loss, as well as their response to various interventions such as weight loss drugs and diets, will depend on individual factors such as genetics" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-317571"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Someone’s ability to achieve and sustain weight loss, as well as their response to various interventions such as weight loss drugs and diets, will depend on individual factors such as genetics&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What actually works for weight loss? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has tried to lose weight will be aware of a disconnect between &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; to reduce body fat and &lt;em&gt;succeeding &lt;/em&gt;in doing so. Professor Clemmensen’s idea of “obesity memory” provides a possible explanation for this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if “eat less; move more” does not work as an approach, what does? This is a tricky question to answer, Professor Clemmensen says, as research into the topic is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do we actually have enough knowledge to guide people on how to live, in terms of losing weight? I don’t think so. I think that’s part of the hard truth we, as researchers, sometimes have to deliver,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; and exercise are unimportant – wider health-promoting behaviours, regardless of their impact on body weight, should always be encouraged. Eating a nourishing diet rich in a large variety of vegetables combined with protein and some kind of fish is more likely to have a favourable impact on the body – compositionally and hormonally – than less nutrient-dense alternatives like junk food, helping you feel and function better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Macronutrient composition will have different effects on the various hormonal systems in the body,” Professor Clemmensen explains. “If you get all your calories from liquid sugar versus from chicken breast, it will have very different impacts on the hormonal environment in the body, and subsequent feelings of hunger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same applies for exercise. Moving more will have a transformative effect on health markers such as blood pressure and your risk of chronic diseases, but Professor Clemmensen says, “There is very little evidence to suggest it can override that memory of prior bodyweight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no single intervention that provides an all-encompassing solution, and people’s varied genetic make-ups render blanket prescriptions impossible. But a combination of manageable interventions appears to be the most productive course of action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing sustainable habits such as sufficient sleep, a nutritious diet and regular exercise will form part of the puzzle. These are things you can implement to improve overall health – and possibly assist in appetite regulation, energy balance and weight management too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Professor Clemmensen and Johansen suggest that environmental and societal changes, long-term planning and pharmacological interventions are also necessary in reversing wider obesity rates in the long run.

solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To reduce obesity rates, we have to look at a more long-term perspective, thinking about generations beyond our little existence,” says Professor Clemmensen. “I think we need to funnel a lot of research into preventative strategies and learning how to create societies where we will have fewer gene-environment interactions that lead to obesity in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the world needs to change to encourage healthier behaviours – for example, greater prominence and availability of nourishing foods over ultra-processed energy-dense alternatives, and neighbourhoods that prioritise walking and cycling over travelling by car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about weight loss drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, which fall under the banner of “pharmacological interventions”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think weight loss drugs have actually helped people acknowledge how difficult it is to sustain weight loss through willpower,” Professor Clemmensen continues. “Now we have pharmacological tools that we know work, and they will be relevant for people who are made sick by their excess body fat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, as Johansen points out, many of these weight loss drugs “don’t seem to be good at maintaining weight loss when people stop the treatment”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People also experience comorbidities like diabetes, high blood pressure and systemic inflammation when they stop the treatment,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some evidence suggests that a combination of exercise and pharmacological weight loss can be very beneficial for supporting weight loss maintenance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Clemmensen also emphasises the importance of promoting healthy behaviours in children – particularly those aged seven and below, due to their more “malleable weight regulation system”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are different critical periods of your life,” Professor Clemmensen says. “There’s your time in the womb, then post-birth, then there’s this growth spurt between four and seven – then again, as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is some genetic predisposition [to changes in weight], but if you put that person or those genes in an environment that is really unsuitable, you risk developing excess fat mass in those critical periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not about restricting these children or individuals, but creating an environment in which they don’t have free access to a ton of calories 24/7, or exposure to a lot of screens, poor sleep and poor psychological health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean reducing the marketing of junk food to children, investing in healthier school meals, standardising restaurant portion sizes and encouraging regular exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing favourable traits in childhood to suit the genetic hand someone has been dealt could then set them on a trajectory to having less body fat as an adult, Professor Clemmensen ventures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his ultimate goal, and the intervention he believes has the greatest scope for success, is researching, identifying and altering an individual’s “obesity memory”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still think if we can understand where and how this memory resides, maybe we can erase it and help people reset their body weight,” he says. “If we can learn to understand the physiology, we can learn how to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read

Kim also said that a scan revealed that activity in Micah’s brain was “not present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a January 1 video, Kim said that “after fighting 11 long hard days, [Micah] went home to the house of our father.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are so proud of him. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart as his dad, on behalf of my family, for all the ways you guys prayed and lifted us up during this time,” Kim continued. “This incredibly difficult, impossible time for our family.

I love you in Christ,” Kim said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those two weeks we were fighting long and hard, we were consulting legal, health, ethical teams even outside the hospital. Just to make sure we weren't leaving any stone unturned. In many ways we were fighting for Micah to buy him as much time as possible, until he passed. As a father, that is my duty I was called to do that. Even if in God's ultimate will it wasn't meant for him to recover.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim has shared media coverage of his son’s death on Instagram, saying: “God is using Micah to evangelize the world. He’s taken over daddy’s ministry. Go son, go! My heart is broken but so proud of you. Ask God to allow you to be canonized so I can finally take mommy on that trip to Italy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micah’s death comes amid a surge of severe flu cases impacting people of all ages, including children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child death toll from flu rose again this week as &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/flu-washington-japan-canada-united-kingdom-b2892431.html"&gt;cases of super flu continued to surge&lt;/a&gt; across more than a dozen states in the U.S. The nationwide tally ticked up to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;nine children&lt;/a&gt;, with health officials in Ohio and Kentucky reporting their &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/health/children-flu-hospital-rates-care-doctors-b2707352.html"&gt;first pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcements come on the heels of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/health/flu-symptoms-cases-spike-b2694411.html"&gt;worst flu season in nearly 15 years in 2024.&lt;/a&gt; This year, the agency &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that there have been 7.5 million infections, more than 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 flu deaths across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOeC1pVUJaYzJaT1dwbFM4dVE0Ulh5d3RrZVo4WjVFbGNNckFxYnAwakJBV0tMVmpGWktqQ2FlYjJhQzh4ckdFQkh1LTlWZ0ZCMzh1bnM5XzRwd2NHNjd3OWpNa184ZHRmRWNQcnpqR2g4VV9WVlJwN3RZWXZTaW51Rnln</guid></item><item><title>一项“艰巨”的基因研究刚刚发现了一种治疗多动症的新方法- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251225035342.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Attention disorders such as ADHD occur when the brain has trouble separating meaningful signals from constant background input. The brain continuously processes sights, sounds, and internal thoughts, and focus depends on its ability to ignore distractions while responding to what matters. Most current treatments improve attention by increasing activity in brain circuits that control focus, especially in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a different solution. Instead of increasing brain activity, the research points to reducing baseline activity as a way to lower mental noise and improve attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Gene Linked to Calmer Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, scientists report that a gene called &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; plays an important role in attention by shaping how quiet or noisy the brain is at rest. Mice with reduced levels of two specific forms of this gene showed calmer brain activity and performed better on tasks requiring focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings may represent an early step toward new treatments aimed at calming the mind rather than stimulating it. The implications extend beyond ADHD, since &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; has also been linked to disorders involving early sensory processing differences, including autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gene we found has a striking effect on attention and is relevant to humans," says Priya Rajasethupathy, head of the Skoler Horbach Family Laboratory of Neural Dynamics and Cognition at Rockefeller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Unexpected Genetic Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the research team began exploring the genetics of attention, &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; was not an obvious candidate. Scientists have long known the gene for its role in neurotransmission, and many interacting proteins of &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; have appeared in genetic studies of attention disorders, but &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; itself had not previously stood out as a key driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate more broadly, the researchers analyzed the genomes of nearly 200 mice bred from eight different parental strains, including some with wild ancestry. This approach was designed to reflect the genetic diversity seen in human populations and allowed subtle genetic influences to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was a Herculean effort, and really novel for the field," says Rajasethupathy, who credits PhD student Zachary Gershon for leading the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Large Genetic Effect on Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large-scale genetic analysis revealed a clear pattern. Mice that performed best on attention tasks had much lower levels of &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region essential for focus. The gene was located within a stretch of DNA that explained nearly 20 percent of the variation in attention among the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[That's] a huge effect," Rajasethupathy says. "Even accounting for any overestimation here of the size of this effect, which can happy for many reasons, that's a remarkable number. Most of the time, you're lucky if you find a gene that affects even 1 percent of a trait."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing Is Critical During Brain Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that not all forms of &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; contributed equally. Two specific versions, known as &lt;em&gt;Homer1a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ania3&lt;/em&gt;, were responsible for the attention differences. Mice that excelled at attention tasks naturally had lower levels of these versions in their prefrontal cortex, while other forms of the gene were unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researchers experimentally reduced &lt;em&gt;Homer1a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ania3&lt;/em&gt; during a brief developmental period in adolescent mice, the effects were striking. The animals became faster, more accurate, and less distractible across several behavioral tests. Making the same changes in adult mice produced no benefit, showing that &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; influences attention during a limited early-life window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Quieting the Brain Improves Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unexpected insight came from examining how &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; affects brain cells. Lowering &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; levels in prefrontal cortex neurons caused those cells to increase GABA receptors -- the molecular brakes of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change reduced unnecessary background firing while preserving strong, focused bursts of activity when important cues appeared. Instead of responding constantly, neurons conserved their activity for moments that required attention, leading to more accurate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were sure that the more attentive mice would have more activity in the prefrontal cortex, not less," Rajasethupathy says. "But it made some sense. Attention is, in part, about blocking everything else out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Calmer Way to Think About Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gershon, who lives with ADHD, the findings felt intuitive. "It's part of my story," he says, "and one of the inspirations for me wanting to apply genetic mapping to attention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also the first in the lab to notice that lowering &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; improved focus by reducing distractions. In his view, the results align with common experiences. "Deep breathing, mindfulness, meditation, calming the nervous system -- people consistently report better focus following these activities," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Future Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for attention disorders typically increase excitatory signaling in prefrontal brain circuits using stimulant medications. The new findings point toward a different possibility: therapies that improve attention by calming neural activity instead of amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; and its interacting proteins have been linked to ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism, further research may reshape how scientists understand multiple neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies from the Rajasethupathy lab will focus on refining the genetic understanding of attention, with the goal of developing therapies that precisely adjust &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a splice site in &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; that can be pharmacologically targeted, which may be an ideal way to help dial the knob on brain signal-to-noise levels," Rajasethupathy says. "This offers a tangible path toward creating a medication that has a similar quieting effect as meditation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early puppyhood is often filled with clumsy movements, curious discoveries, and moments that are unintentionally hilarious. For many pet parents, these fleeting stages pass quickly, making them worth capturing on camera whenever possible. One such moment recently caught the internet’s attention, thanks to a short but charming video of a Golden Retriever puppy figuring out how his body works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-shows-golden-retriever-puppy-walk-in-reverse-because-he-can-t-turn-around"&gt;Video shows Golden Retriever puppy walk in reverse because he can’t turn around&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent video shared by @adventures.of.pilot, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy called Pilot is attempting to navigate his surroundings but ends up walking backward instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Onscreen text explains the situation: “Enjoy this video of my puppy walking in reverse because he didn’t know how to turn around.” The puppy takes hesitant, wobbly steps as he slowly backs up, appearing genuinely unsure of what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilot is also wearing a small harness, which some viewers speculated may have added to his confusion. Whether it was the harness or simply a case of puppy brain, the result was a hilarious and wholesome scene. As he carefully reverses, his movements are cautious but determined, as if he believes backing up is the only logical solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for the clip to gain traction. The video quickly racked up more than 310K likes and drew over a hundred comments from viewers who related to Pilot’s behavior or simply found it hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many shared stories of their own dogs going through similar phases, noting how common it is for puppies to struggle with basic movements as they learn coordination and spatial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One viewer jokingly wrote “beep beep beep,” comparing Pilot’s backward steps to a vehicle reversing. Another called him “a little goofball,” while someone else said their own puppy looked like he was “processing how to walk” during his early days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One popular comment summed up the playful tone by saying Golden Retrievers are “just orange cats in disguise,” joking that they all seem to share “one single brain cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Another called him “a little goofball,” while someone else said their own puppy looked like he was “processing how to walk” during his early days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One popular comment summed up the playful tone by saying Golden Retrievers are “just orange cats in disguise,” joking that they all seem to share “one single brain cell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/201001-golden-retriever-puppy-reverse-walk-video-funny" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Hits Reverse After Failing To Turn Around;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Hits Reverse After Failing To Turn Around&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:48:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQNG9adThuVEt2ZG13TUJBcFIxWUlLU2FJdURFZWpmYUd2dFZ5ZE4zdV95ZzRtRVh6ckFYMkVzdTZ2clREU21PcE1SUXVQOUpPRWpIaG4td2lUM3d4eDBEWDNySmNEbHVfRzFPcDRibXp6bS04dlk0eXRzUEJvVnRGMUwzTVZlUUhJbGxid1ZtU1VVOW8</guid></item><item><title>在中国， A.I.发现医生可能会错过的胰腺癌--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/02/world/asia/china-ai-cancer-pancreatic.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:34:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNQkhJMktSeGRHTGlCS2pCM3pmaERKMVE5T1laSE95MEN6T1pVd2F1YVlDUjljZlFqYW5wRmVzX2FhQ045ZWhmVFVxaGFmeDI1ZWY5ZFN4cU1XQXpaT0VkSFNwRl9pdTZGTndFVDlsbzhBZTVPa2hHYWh1Q3pxZ3VIVWdQWQ</guid></item><item><title>为什么皮肤科医生不推荐用于老化皮肤的胶原蛋白补充剂- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/why-dermatologists-arent-recommending-collagen-supplements-for-aging-skin/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:24:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNZm53LUZ3VDM5ZGVlQzF0Ry10RC1DQnMxdkdhbEoxbmFtZ1FvRXVYMUk3a2J2WVd4YlEyOFJGTjU1LWRJV0ZUN3kxdWxvb0pCN0JGaXFablBsdWRBTWZVa29Jd1hVRHJRcnFBd3B2UkFuZ2VZeU5LeC1TR216ZkFhUzNjbVhmSGRkeHFnS0N0X3AtaHh1WUZjQkd4STJ4SmJI</guid></item><item><title>科学家警告，潜伏在全球水系统中的隐形“脑吞噬”威胁- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-warn-of-an-invisible-brain-eating-threat-lurking-in-water-systems-worldwide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNR0VlZ3ZJdmU1S1BmZFh5dWlwcGFySVN0VG52UmpkNVJ6MDVsdFVsYTFnUWxwVWZSb0w0SFhNUFBrS0EtdHdzRE9OV3ZOQmw1c2MtNHd6dzdMaldhVFkyUTM3cjc0ajhJZ3p6NlY5M2FKS3JxelpZVXpOd3pFQzg3LWJ3QlRDeUplM0dxeDNIUkVlY0VOYWpVRXBGUVIxRnViSTlwMUhSYUM5NHZIejZLd1d3</guid></item><item><title>随着流感季节的加剧， UNC健康医院开始临时限制访客- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/news/local/unc-health-visitor-restrictions-january-2026/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;UNC Health's Triangle-area hospitals will implement temporary visitor restrictions on Monday, Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The resetrictions include measures as:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors 11 years old and younger will be prohibited from all hospital inpatient areas and waiting areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors older than 11 with respiratory symptoms will be prohibited from inpatient areas and waiting areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All employees at designated inpatient locations will be required to wear a mask while providing care. Masks are not required, but strongly encouraged, for patients and visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Affected facilities include UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill and Hillsborough, UNC Health Rex in Raleigh and Holly Springs, UNC Health Chatham in Siler City, and UNC Health Johnston in Clayton and Smithfield. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The restrictions have been put in place in recent years during the cold weather months when respiratory illnesses increase. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the state saw a significant jump in emergency room admissions from flu-like illnesses last week. Approximately 2,000 people had flu-like symptoms, according to &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard"&gt;data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 39 people have died from the flu so far this winter in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;SEMINOLE — When Anita Froese’s middle daughter came down with fatigue, body aches and the tell-tale sign of measles — strawberry-colored spots splattered across her skin — she waited it out. Two days later, her son developed the same symptoms. After a week, the disease finally reached her youngest daughter, who vomited all night as her fever spiked to 104.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froese never brought her children to a doctor. Instead, she administered cod liver oil, vitamins, tea and broth. She refreshed their cold compresses and ran them epsom salt baths. She brought them to a holistic health center for an IV treatment used for heavy metal poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of her kids are fully vaccinated against measles. She stopped immunizing her first two as infants after hearing stories about others who had bad reactions to the shots, and she approved no shots for her third. Even as an outbreak ripped through her community, Froese preferred that her children contract measles to build natural immunity because to her, measles was on par with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like this was a disease that had come up now and was this big deal,” said Froese, who was vaccinated as a child. “To me, that wasn’t the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But outside of the West Texas town of 7,000, health experts watched in horror as the once-dormant disease spread like a drop of blood in water across Seminole and the outlying counties, hitting at least three other states and breaching international borders. It killed two children, both Mennonites like Froese. It sickened at least 762 Texans — more than half of whom live in Seminole’s Gaines County — and hospitalized 99 statewide. The West Texas outbreak was the nation’s largest in more than 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the Mennonites at the center of it, the scrutiny was worse than the disease itself. Today, Froese and others say they’re no more likely to get vaccinated, and they’re even less trusting of the government and health officials who they feel targeted them and blamed them for causing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mennonites questioned why measles forced their religious community into the national spotlight. They didn’t know why TV crews clamored to film them grieving little girls who they believed died from underlying conditions or negligent hospitals rather than measles. They didn’t understand the messages from outsiders demanding they leave the country for exercising their right to not vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re looked at as this ignorant people that’s almost fueling this thing, like we’re having measles parties, and that was never the case,” said Pastor Jake Fehr of Mennonite Evangelical Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy has been brewing for the last 20 years among Mennonites, a cloistered Christian sect with a historical distrust in government.

&lt;p&gt;The religious group is a microcosm of the distrust in vaccines gripping the state. Twice as many Texas parents exempted their kindergartners from measles vaccines this year compared to five years ago, with Gaines County among the highest at almost 20% of its kindergartners being exempt, compared to the state average of less than 4%. Seminole’s vaccination rate is likely far lower when it includes the Mennonites who are homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the world’s &lt;a href="https://apic.org/measles/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;most infectious&lt;/a&gt; diseases, measles causes rash and flu-like symptoms and was for many years rare in the U.S. because of widespread vaccination. Especially in young children, measles can cause complications like blindness, brain swelling and even death. Two doses of the measles vaccine are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at avoiding the disease, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials declared the outbreak over in August — ending an event Froese thinks was inflated from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know of plenty of people that had measles when they were children, and they all survived,” Froese said. “To me, that was a risk I was willing to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As measles tore through his community last winter, John Peters, 54, feared the disease was causing his pallor, ringing ears, body pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, after his Mennonite mettle crumbled against his wife’s demand that he seek help, he finally saw a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t have measles. He had leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters got seven blood transfusions in a week, and six more over the next three months. When he returned from a hospital stay in the spring, he regretted high-fiving a blotchy child at the grocery store. He changed his immigration consulting firm to appointment-only and asked clients to wash their hands and stay home if they had been around sick people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had zero immunity,” he said. “I could not afford to get measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters, who trusts mainstream medicine, considers himself a modern Mennonite. He wears a goatee and a Texas Tech University ring, which traditional Mennonites consider vain. He owns 17 guns even though Mennonites are pacifists. Despite his neighbors avoiding the public eye, Peters is a town celebrity because he hosts a weekly radio show and pens monthly columns in the local newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother grew up in a Mennonite colony in Mexico and combined natural and Western medicine. She administered Tylenol and Vicks VapoRub, smeared pig lard on her children’s chests to relieve congestion and believed Dr. Pepper was a cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mennonites are predisposed to questioning vaccine mandates. Their history of persecution from political and religious authorities has created a culture of distrust in the government. The Mennonite movement broke from Anabaptists in 16th century Northern Europe, moving through Russia, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. in sequestered communities — Peters estimates that a third of Mennonites in West Texas are undocumented. While some Mennonite groups are integrated in society, many Mennonite women in Seminole still know only Low German, which is spoken in Northern Germany and parts of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite valuing traditional remedies, Peters’ mom was vaccinated as a child and she would later immunize her children, including Peters. She fell in line with much of her generation of Mennonites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t argue the fact that vaccinated people fight measles better,” Peters said, adding that he vaccinated his two daughters after doing research and talking to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters’ take on health care is a product of both his past and present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against his doctors’ advice, Peters drank a fruit juice that Mennonites insisted would cure his cancer and which he said tastes like rotten cherries. He drew the line at offers from friends and another leukemia patient to take the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, opting to give his $15,000 monthly prescription a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He appreciates unorthodox approaches to medicine — like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoting vitamin A to treat measles — and he speculates that natural remedies could be as effective as vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he wishes more of his community vaccinated because he knows vaccines eradicated polio. Before the measles shot became available in 1963, the disease killed 400 to 500 American children each year. Peters believes modern medicine is why he’s here today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hospital system saved my life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the measles outbreak endangered him in his vulnerable condition, it also solidified his views against forced immunizations. He wondered whether his two rounds of COVID shots could have caused his leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, pushes for Mennonites to vaccinate and quarantine gave Peters flashbacks to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already opposed to government rules, Mennonites bristled at pressure from authorities to stick out their arms during the 2020 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pro-vax crowd, I think in my opinion, has kind of messed up,” Peters said. “If you’re living in the land of the free and you pretty much have to get vaccinated, to the third generation Mennonites — the kids that grew up here — that just doesn’t sound right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

She skipped only one Sunday mass when her teens were sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went about life normally because she believed measles wasn’t a threat to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As sick as they were, they’ve been just as sick with other things that they’ve had in the past, just then they didn’t have the rash,” she said. “And they got it, they got over it, and we went on with life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She disavowed vaccines after hearing about children of people she knew who were never the same after they received the shot: a young boy gone blind, and a girl who seized and foamed at the mouth, becoming a quadriplegic, she said. Local Mennonite shop owners, church-goers and pastors cite similar stories, saying the risk isn’t worth the immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have proven time and again that vaccines have a &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0615/p786.html" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;low risk&lt;/a&gt; of severe complications, though mild effects are common as the body builds protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know whether vaccines caused these maladies without the patients’ full medical history, said Wesley Friesen, a Mennonite operating room nurse at the Seminole Hospital District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to trust that what they’re telling you is true. But sometimes you wonder, what’s the whole story?” Friesen said, expressing skepticism about whether serious vaccine complications resulted from the medicine. “There are individuals that did experience negative side effects, probably, you know, for decades. But you have to look at the whole picture. I mean, are they basing their decision on a relatively small percentage?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As measles spread, local health food stores began distributing unconventional treatments including free cod liver oil and budesonide inhalers, which are typically used for asthma, while vitamin A &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;flew off&lt;/a&gt; the shelves. Mennonites reached for wonder oil — herb-infused rubbing alcohol to reduce fevers — and supplements that claim to enhance various bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some Seminole residents got vaccinated amid the outbreak, drive-by vaccine tents largely sat dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Peters, Froese also believes COVID turned more Mennonites off vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought authorities overreacted to scare people into getting immunized. The restrictions felt overbearing and punitive: A local hospital limited visits, leaving Froese’s children to gaze at their cancer-ridden grandmother through the window for what they thought would be the last time. She was alarmed when a hospital refused to administer ivermectin to her father-in-law, though global health authorities recommend against treating COVID-19 with ivermectin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know when you’re dealing with something that you don’t understand, you know, for the doctors, even they have to do something that they then think works,” Froese said. “But again, I think COVID was blown out of proportion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so was the measles outbreak, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovering, her daughters shed hair for two months and one developed an acne-like condition that vitamins couldn’t treat, but antibiotics did. Measles can cause &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia#:~:text=This%20leaves%20the%20person%20susceptible,had%20received%20the%20MMR%20vaccine." class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;“immune amnesia,”&lt;/a&gt; where the body forgets how to fight infections for months to years, but Froese questions whether the after effects of measles are as bad as doctors and public health authorities have made them out to be, and whether the skin condition was related to measles at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s proud of how her community responded to the outbreak and now believes more strongly that they can fend off diseases without official help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were getting so much media attention and blame for all this kind of stuff,” Froese said. “And I think we all just decided that we would rally together and get through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent Sunday, more than 170 cars filled the gravel parking lot of the Mennonite Evangelical Church in Seminole. In a pew facing walls decorated with two plain wreaths, a man in scuffed cowboy boots wrapped his arm around his wife, who wore an ankle-length velvet dress, emerald green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their five children had recovered from measles, and in July, one daughter won gold in the national tumbling competition. The disease was behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early December, almost a year from the start of the outbreak, 17 new cases appeared in the U.S. If these strains share DNA with those in West Texas, the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/05/texas-measles-outbreak-spread-elimination/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;might follow&lt;/a&gt; Canada in losing its measles elimination status, which it’s had for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least in Seminole, people are safe from another measles event because they’ve either been vaccinated or fought the disease, said Dr. Wendell Parkey, chief of staff for Seminole Memorial Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he’s now staring down the barrel of a different vaccine-preventable outbreak: whooping cough. He thinks all the medical community can do now is adapt their practices to prepare for more sick people each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want a society like this. I’d rather be in a society that vaccinates,” Parkey said. “But you don’t get a choice on playing that game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials spread the word about the importance of measles vaccines in person and through the radio, newspapers and churches. Local doctors and Mennonite experts fear the town’s anti-vaccine camp will respond the same to the next outbreak unless authorities learn to speak their figurative — and sometimes literal — language to answer their questions and build confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Seminole residents circulated messages to avoid reporters during the outbreak, John Dueck, editor of the Canada-based newspaper Die Mennonitische Post, became a de facto Mennonite expert for government officials and news media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dueck published an editorial explaining the facts about measles and vaccines in terms that appealed to Mennonite values about protecting the community. He said Mennonites and the Canadian government gave him positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you come into a community just in time when everything is burning, you will find people nervous,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they might be more receptive to messages from authorities about vaccines and health scares if they already formed a relationship during calm times, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seminole doctors worry that will be tough after the measles outbreak whittled what scant trust remained among the vaccine hesitant community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some Mennonite families got vaccinated during the outbreak, Friesen said health messaging fell short because it came across as orders.

Each participant provided information on their daily consumption of coffee, tea, and water, along with other lifestyle habits and their health history. The result: people who divided their daily fluid intake between several drinks—especially water, coffee, and tea—had a lower mortality risk than those who concentrated mainly on just one drink. The most favorable ratio of coffee to tea netted out at two cups of coffee for every three cups of tea—i.e., if you've already had one of each and still want another, grab a tea next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pattern that stood out particularly positively was when coffee and tea were consumed together. In moderate quantities, supplemented by sufficient water, this combination was most common among the participants with the best long-term health values. The decisive factor here was, above all, about balance: neither excessive coffee consumption nor drinking only water or tea scored best, but the mixture throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Which factors are really decisive in the combination of drinks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study emphasize that the results are based on observations. This means that they show correlations, but do not prove any direct causes. Nevertheless, the results fit in well with what we already know. While coffee and tea provide natural plant substances, water supports basic processes in the body. Together, they could ensure that the body is well hydrated and at the same time benefits from things like antioxidants in coffee and tea, which studies have linked to anti-inflammatory effects, better vascular function, and a more stable metabolism—all factors that are also relevant for life expectancy in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is particularly interesting to note is that drinking water alone was not automatically associated with the best results. Although drinking enough remains an important basis for good health, the analysis shows that water is particularly beneficial when it is part of a varied beverage pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5abDJpYVNWU2JvNEhtcnpNSDBrWEhVRmw1aHNtendHOWd0REJ5WU9lVHpuYlM2WTdCTjFlaC14UjFJUVpHSGJEQUNsbVctUWFVNTVfaUE2TEMteDdmN1diQmlpbGJINjFkNGItQjc1Zw</guid></item><item><title>您应该在适当的时候服用3种补充剂，以获得更好的效果- Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/supplements-to-take-at-the-right-time-11868429</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The timing of when you take some supplements matters. Get the most out of your supplement by taking it at the times that maximize absorption and effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-iron"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Iron &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can better &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/time-to-take-iron-supplement-8753638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maximize your iron supplement's benefits&lt;/a&gt; when you take it at certain times, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an empty stomach&lt;/strong&gt;: Studies suggest iron is best absorbed when taken without food. Try taking it at least 30 minutes before a meal or two hours after a meal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With vitamin C&lt;/strong&gt;: Pairing iron with vitamin C may enhance the absorption of iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separated from supplements or drugs containing calcium or phosphorus:&lt;/strong&gt; Supplements that contain calcium or phosphorus and calcium-containing antacids can interfere with iron's absorption. Take your iron at least two hours apart from these.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vitamin-b12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Vitamin B12 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Understanding &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/when-to-take-vitamin-b12-11856477" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;when and how to take vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; can help you optimize absorption and benefits:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it in the morning for energy&lt;/strong&gt;: Taking B12 in the morning or early afternoon can help boost your energy. This is because B12 helps your body convert food into energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it on an empty stomach&lt;/strong&gt;: Taking it on an empty stomach helps improve absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid taking it with certain foods or beverages&lt;/strong&gt;: High amounts of vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) can reduce B12's absorption if consumed at the same time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space it apart from medications&lt;/strong&gt;: Separate B12 and medications such as metformin and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/proton-pump-inhibitors-what-they-do-and-how-they-work-8727585" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proton pump inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; by at least four hours to ensure optimal absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-time-of-day-to-take-vitamin-d-11859257" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Taking vitamin D in the morning&lt;/a&gt; is recommended to achieve the best results. This is because evening intake may reduce melatonin production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-does-melatonin-work-11702694" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Melatonin&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin D work in opposition, so taking your vitamin D too late may impact your sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body produces vitamin D when you are exposed to sunlight. Since it's challenging to get sufficient vitamin D from food alone, consider &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-foods-immune-health-5094903" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplementing during the winter months&lt;/a&gt; when sunlight is limited, especially if you have limited sun exposure.

I press my face into my damp pillow to mute the occasional, plaintive chirp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much of a crier, so these late-night keening sessions make no sense. I’m a 59-year-old, happily married woman, and my children are healthy and grown, yet when the lights go out and the world lies down, a single phrase repeats itself in my mind: &lt;em&gt;I want my mom. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother isn’t missing or gone. She lives a short 20-minute drive away in an assisted living facility. When I visit, she looks like herself, shorter than me, hair dyed brown and styled in pert curls, with a smile people say looks like mine. When she speaks, her word choices, her intonations and the way she moves her hands are all her, but if you sit with her for more than a few minutes, you learn she’s less like herself and more like a carnival hologram — repeating a limited, looping set of thoughts and comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have nine windows in my apartment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My cat is the best roommate I’ve ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did I tell you your husband reminds me of my dad?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, my mother had been single and independent, living on her own, volunteering and singing in a local chorale. At 78, she was in excellent health and had great energy, so I was taken by surprise when she announced she’d be moving into a retirement community near my home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An old folks’ home?” I said. “But you’re in great shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a ‘home,’ it’s a retirement village. Just like apartment living, but I don’t have to cook anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No loss for the world there,” I snorted, and she elbowed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, we visited the facility, more like a resort with scheduled activities and concerts than the 1970s nursing home my paternal grandmother had lived and died in. But still. Weaving through walkers and motorized scooters to get to the facility’s restaurant, I said, “These people, they’re nice, but they seem… elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She squared off with me. At 5’1”, she projects an air of sweet amiability, but she’s actually stubborn as an old root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mother was sick my entire childhood,” she said. It was true. Her poor mother suffered for nine years, Bible in hand and disapproval on her face, until she finally died, releasing my 17-year-old mother. “I’m not doing that to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not remotely the same! I’m older, and you’re not sick, or nasty.” I looked at her sideways. “At least most of the time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our way out, we passed a locked industrial door, behind which was the “Assisted Living Wing” and “Memory Ward.” Pastel-colored cutouts of flowers and butterflies, the sort you’d see taped to a nursery school wall, decorated the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s in there?” I asked, and made scary ghost sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You, if you keep it up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It never occurred to me there might be something she wasn’t telling me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, age 2, with her mother&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 12, 2020, the day after Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced they had COVID-19, my mother’s Toyota Camry pulled into my driveway, and out she stepped with two suitcases, the food from her refrigerator, her recycling and her cat, named Jello, howling and spitting in its carrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just until we flatten the curve,” she said, reluctant to leave her apartment. “And not a minute more.” She lived with me for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother and I are different people. She’s fussy. I’m casual — sloppy, even. She’s soft-spoken. I’m loud. She’s ladylike. I intentionally storm through a room. And while I know I’m not the refined young lady she hoped for as a daughter, she’s been my champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I hated wearing dresses, so she sewed me pants. And when a male teacher told her, “Your daughter must wear dresses to school — pants are inappropriate,” she fired back, “You’re either going to let her wear pants, or you’re going to see her underwear, because she’s always upside-down on the monkey bars!” I got to wear pants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we managed to find joy and beauty in our togetherness during the lockdown. We visited the local arboretum, haunted our old town, even had a picnic on the porch of our old house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody lives here! Who’s going to care?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We peeked in the windows and tried to see if any doors were unlocked. She stood watch for me while I crawled under the porch to see if old treasures I had hidden were still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nothing but spiders and dirt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited her room daily with chocolate chip cookies. “Wellness check,” I’d say, and she’d invite me into her too-warm space. I’d nudge Jello, ever a grumpy thing, off the armchair and sit down for a quick chat over the blaring television. It was during one of those visits that I first noticed something was off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mom, you shouldn’t watch the news 24 hours a day. It’s grim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I leave it on for the company — the voices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You live with me. That’s enough voices for anyone. If you have to watch TV, can you at least watch &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/netflix"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;?” I handed her the remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That thing’s too complicated. I like the news,” she said and took a dainty bite of her cookie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For goodness’ sake! You just push this button here that says Netflix.” She waved me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, she poured laundry detergent into our dryer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said. “I’ll pay for it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s no big deal,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d once put the cereal box in the fridge and the milk in the cupboard. Our family can be spacey like that, so I wrote it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as her memory glitched more frequently, I found myself becoming impatient. It was easier to be annoyed with her, easier to look away from what might be happening to her, from what might one day happen to me. It was easier to imagine she was being lazy-minded or stubborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just met with your surgeon two weeks ago, don’t you remember? Your pain is coming from your spine, not your hip, so you have to do physical therapy,” I told her one afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DO YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPY! And can you wear your hearing aids? It’s very annoying to repeat myself all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like physical therapy,” she said. “And anyway, you’re the only one I can’t hear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"This is Jello, and he's daring me to even think about coming any closer," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our arguments regressed. We were silly, a little petty, almost joking, but not quite. I found myself using the same words she’d spoken to me when I was young, pantomiming a role reversal we didn’t realize was well underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do as you’re told!” I’d demand, only half joking when she ate mostly chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re not the boss of me!” she’d say, and cross her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then she drove into oncoming traffic with my daughter in the car. It was a close call — the other car swerved. My daughter told me she’d never let Grandma drive her again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I took her keys that day, but I didn’t. It’s difficult — removing your parents’ means of transportation. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/uber"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; generation. You take their keys, you take their independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I called my mother while waiting in the social distancing line that snaked around Trader Joe’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank goodness you called! My phone isn’t working!” she said, breathless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re on your phone now, Mom,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t call anyone. I couldn’t find anyone’s numbers. I was all alone!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t upsetting that she couldn’t work her phone for a moment — many older people struggle with technology. It was upsetting that she was panicked, desperate and at a loss for what to do, when really, all she had to do was step out of her bedroom and ask any of her grandchildren for assistance. It was upsetting because she felt helpless and afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s going on, Mom?” I asked when I got home. It never occurred to me she could be any other than the way I had always known her: capable, pragmatic and independent. I didn’t know that these days — the early days — were the good days when she remembered where she was, who she was, who I was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day I took her keys was the day she mistook my daughter for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It was easier to be annoyed with her, easier to look away from what might be happening to her, from what might one day happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As intelligent, sentient beings, we sure can be shockingly unaware of our own emotions and why we’re feeling them. Recently, I was hiking in a forest near my home. I came upon an elderly woman in hiking boots sitting on a fallen tree near a brook, leaning on her walking stick. I couldn’t imagine how she had gotten there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She smiled. “I’m just taking a breather. I live a mile up there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed her stick up the steep, wooded hill. She’d come from Sweden decades earlier to marry an American who’d recently moved them into a retirement home. Like my mother, she was born on the cusp of World War II. Unlike my mother, she spoke about politics, current events, a book she was reading. Then she got up and stretched. I didn’t want her to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can I visit you, maybe help with your errands?” I asked. She looked at me, puzzled, and I felt instant embarrassment. This was not a woman who needed help with her errands. She had just walked a mile into the woods. Why would she need me to visit her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my husband’s pandemic projects was to hang birdhouses all around our yard. A storm knocked one down, and four bluish babies with giant open mouths tumbled out onto the grass. Blind, chirping and barely able to move, they reminded me of the P.D. Eastman book “Are You My Mother?” about a baby bird who searches for his mother. He asks everything he comes across: a dog, a hen, a steam shovel, “Are you my mother?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I slid a spoon under the wobbly birds’ bodies and poured them back into their home, I was struck by a thought: &lt;em&gt;I’m the baby bird in P.D. Eastman’s book. I’m looking for my mother, who is slipping away from me. And the lovely Swedish woman in the woods? She is not my mother. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author with her mother. "We were off on some pandemic adventure," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months after my mom packed up Jello and moved back to her apartment, I got a call from the onsite nurse explaining she had accidentally consumed five weeks’ medication in two weeks. It was time for her to move into assisted living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remembered the door with the flowers and butterflies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe she saw this coming. I believe she knew her mind was slipping, so she moved herself into a place where, at some point, she could get professional care, and where, like she said, she wouldn’t become a “burden.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the things she says in her moments of clarity is, “My parents died young. I didn’t have anyone to model getting old for me.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to her, I do. And thanks to her, as the child of a person who is getting old, I’m learning to be more patient, more understanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I call her daily. I visit her often. And every now and then, the mother I know returns for a cameo, then disappears just as quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her darker moments, she tells me, “I’ve had a good life, but if I could push a button and end it now, I would.” I’d like to tell her to hang on — that things will get better — but we both know that’s not true. So I just remind her she is beloved. And we list all the people who’ve loved her in her life, including the boyfriend she dumped in college. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m learning to love her differently, perhaps more deeply and from a place of gratitude, not of need and expectation. I’m trying to be the grown-up now — to champion her, the way she did me. It’s not easy. And in the wee hours of the night, when the loss of my mother as I knew her overtakes me, I allow myself to have a cry in my pillow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kathryn Smith has published fiction and creative nonfiction in Philadelphia Stories, poetry in Apiary, and twice won an honorable mention from Glimmer Train.

&lt;li&gt;For an extra-potent strawberry flavor, try using strawberry milk, or add a scoop of strawberry-flavored protein powder to get a boost of protein too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can garnish with any berry of your choice in addition to strawberries, as well as add a sprinkling of granola.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For extra pizzazz, top the pudding with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7953463/magic-chocolate-drizzle/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chocolate shell&lt;/a&gt; by melting dark chocolate and a bit of coconut oil together. Pour on top of the peanut butter mixture in the jar and chill for 10 minutes until the shell is hardened. Add a dash of flaky salt, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To save time, you can skip making the peanut butter mixture and simply swirl peanut butter on top of the pudding. However, choose a peanut butter made with just peanuts and one that’s more liquid than solid so you get a perfect consistency.&lt;/li&gt;

Much of the fat in chia seeds is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are known to reduce inflammation and lower disease risk. The fiber in chia seeds feeds your beneficial bacteria and helps keep things moving through your gut. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based milks&lt;/a&gt; that naturally contains protein.

The probiotics will thrive on the fiber in the strawberries, chia seeds and peanut butter, helping to create a lush, thriving microbiome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten thousand steps a day&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most widely recognised numbers in modern health culture. It appears on fitness trackers, in health guidelines and across marketing campaigns. Despite its ubiquity, the origin of this figure is not medical. It began as a product slogan in 1960s Japan, not as a clinical recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent research has begun to challenge this long-standing benchmark. Multiple large-scale studies have found that the health benefits associated with walking may begin at lower daily step counts, and that the 10,000-step target may overstate what is necessary for longevity, disease prevention and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Walking remains one of the most accessible forms of physical activity. It is particularly relevant as public health agencies look for low-cost interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour and improve population-level outcomes. However, guidance on &lt;strong&gt;how many steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; are needed is now shifting toward a more evidence-based and personalised model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Step Counts and Mortality Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; tracked nearly 5,000 adults and found that those who walked &lt;strong&gt;8,000 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; had a 51 percent lower &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/bill-gates-admits-i-thought-i-was-one-mistake-away-from-death-with-microsoft-until-the-late-90s/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73393" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of death &lt;/a&gt;from all causes compared with individuals who walked 4,000 steps. The study also reported no significant impact from walking speed. Step volume alone was the defining factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further analysis from &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/how-many-steps-do-you-need-day-see-health-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt; notes that walking as few as &lt;strong&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; contributes to improved longevity, with benefits rising steadily up to about 8,000 steps. Among adults over 60, health improvements plateaued between &lt;strong&gt;6,000 and 8,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;, while for those under 60, the upper limit of gains appeared near &lt;strong&gt;10,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate 2022 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, walking between 8,000 and 10,000 steps per day was associated with lower risk of developing or dying from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/people-who-sleep-like-this-every-night-are-facing-dangerously-high-heart-risks-reveals-major-new-study/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="96135" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found no additional benefit beyond that range, indicating that efforts to exceed it may not yield proportional improvements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Weight Loss and Activity Intensity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although moderate daily steps may support general health, individuals targeting &lt;strong&gt;weight loss through walking&lt;/strong&gt; require greater volumes and structured activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data compiled by &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-miles-should-i-walk-a-day-8690702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/a&gt; shows that walking &lt;strong&gt;10,000 to 12,000 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; can support sustained weight loss when paired with at least &lt;strong&gt;3,500 brisk steps&lt;/strong&gt; in sessions lasting 10 minutes or more. Participants in one cited study who adopted this routine were able to maintain a &lt;strong&gt;10 percent reduction in body weight&lt;/strong&gt; over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals" class="wp-image-101844" data-lazy-srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-380x257.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-520x352.jpg 520w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg" alt="Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals" class="wp-image-101844" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-380x257.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-520x352.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.acsm.org/read-research/resource-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;strong&gt;225 to 420 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; per week to support weight reduction goals. This translates to approximately &lt;strong&gt;2.5 to 3.5 miles daily&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;6,000 to 9,000 brisk steps&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on stride and pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings show a clear distinction between walking for general wellbeing and walking for targeted weight control, with the latter requiring more time, intensity and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sustained Movement Brings Broader Gains&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Emily Larson advises gradual increases in step count, recommending that individuals walking 3,000 steps a day aim to add 1,000 steps weekly. This type of incremental growth appears more effective than pursuing static step targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend distributing walking throughout the day. Multiple studies confirm that three sessions of 10 to 15 minutes can match the benefits of one continuous 30-minute walk. This structure supports individuals with limited time or those reintroducing activity after a sedentary period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Walking Remains One Of The Simplest Tools For Lifelong Health" class="wp-image-101845" data-lazy-srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-380x253.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-520x347.jpg 520w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg" alt="Walking Remains One Of The Simplest Tools For Lifelong Health" class="wp-image-101845" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-380x253.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-520x347.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking remains one of the simplest tools for lifelong health. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health also points to the metabolic advantages of &lt;strong&gt;short walks after meals&lt;/strong&gt;. A 2022 study on post-meal walking found that walking for two minutes after eating helped regulate blood glucose more effectively than standing or remaining seated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all health gains require daily activity. One study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt; observed that walking &lt;strong&gt;four miles just once or twice a week&lt;/strong&gt; still produced positive effects on longevity. This is particularly relevant for people with limited mobility or time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revising Walking Targets for Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current fitness apps and trackers continue to promote the 10,000-step standard, yet researchers now call for more individualised benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; reports that walking &lt;strong&gt;4,500 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; lowers the risk of cardiovascular events by up to &lt;strong&gt;77 percent&lt;/strong&gt; in older adults. Gains continued up to about 7,000 to 8,000 steps per day, but additional steps did not produce further significant reductions in risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking has also been linked to lower rates of several chronic health conditions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customised walking routines are also encouraged for people recovering from illness or living with physical limitations. Recommendations include &lt;strong&gt;pool walking&lt;/strong&gt;, use of &lt;strong&gt;mobility aids&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;short assisted walks&lt;/strong&gt; to maintain daily activity without strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mental health benefits are also well documented. UCLA Health references findings from the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2023/pandemic-coping-exercise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; showing that walking for &lt;strong&gt;75 minutes per week&lt;/strong&gt; at a moderate pace reduced depression risk by 18 percent. Increasing the total to 120 minutes lowered the risk by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/7-ways-wearable-technology-can-help-you-reach-your-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wearable devices &lt;/a&gt;remain valuable tools for tracking daily movement, but researchers suggest shifting the focus from absolute step counts to personalised progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ancient Egyptians and Etruscans pioneered orthodontics, using delicate gold wires and catgut to straighten teeth. It’s a tale that has appeared in dentistry textbooks for decades, portraying our ancestors as surprisingly modern in their pursuit of the perfect smile. But when archaeologists and dental historians finally scrutinised the evidence, they discovered that most of it is myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the &lt;a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/54090268e6fc428088e1da114df97ed8"&gt;El-Quatta dental bridge&lt;/a&gt; from Egypt, dating to around 2500BC. The gold wire found with ancient remains wasn’t doing what we thought at all. Rather than pulling teeth into alignment, these wires were stabilising loose teeth or holding replacement ones in place. In other words, they were functioning as prostheses, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11614199/"&gt;not braces&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold bands discovered in Etruscan tombs tell a similar story. They were probably dental splints designed to support teeth loosened by gum disease or injury, not devices for moving teeth into &lt;a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.9783/9781512806830-007/html"&gt;new positions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some rather compelling practical reasons why these ancient devices couldn’t have worked as braces anyway. Tests on Etruscan appliances revealed the gold used was &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-7496-8_5"&gt;97% pure&lt;/a&gt;, and pure gold is remarkably soft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bends and stretches easily without breaking, which makes it useless for orthodontics. Braces work by applying continuous pressure over long periods, requiring metal that’s strong and springy. Pure gold simply can’t manage that. Try to tighten it enough to straighten a tooth and it will deform or snap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the curious matter of who was wearing these gold bands. Many were found with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17269195/"&gt;skeletons of women&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting they might have been status symbols or decorative jewellery rather than medical devices. Tellingly, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27514349/"&gt;none&lt;/a&gt; were discovered in the mouths of children or teenagers – exactly where you’d expect to find them if they were genuine orthodontic appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most fascinating revelation is this: ancient people didn’t have the same dental problems we face today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malocclusion – the crowding and misalignment of teeth that’s so common now – was extremely rare in the past. Studies of Stone Age skulls show almost &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002941654901037"&gt;no crowding&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is down to diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors ate tough, fibrous foods that required serious chewing. All that jaw work developed strong, large jaws perfectly capable of accommodating all their &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2646990/"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern diets, by contrast, are soft and processed, giving our jaws little exercise. The result? Our jaws are often smaller than those of our ancestors, while our teeth remain the same size, leading to the crowding we see today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since crooked teeth were virtually non-existent in antiquity, there was hardly any reason to develop methods for straightening them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Jaws were larger, due to food being tougher to chew on.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-portrait-tribe-leader-wearing-animal-1595983525?trackingId=039ed9ad-f04e-44c9-a234-f31269a4f46f"&gt;Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, ancient people did occasionally attempt simple interventions for dental irregularities. The Romans provide one of the earliest reliable references to actual orthodontic treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a Roman medical writer in the first century AD, &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674993709"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that if a child’s tooth came in crooked, they should gently push it into place with a finger every day until it shifted to the correct position. Although basic, this method is built on the same principle we use today – gentle, continuous pressure can move a tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Roman era, little progress occurred for centuries. By the 18th century, however, interest in straightening teeth had revived, albeit through some rather agonising methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those without access to modern dental tools resorted to wooden &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27514349/"&gt;“swelling wedges”&lt;/a&gt; to create space between overcrowded teeth. A small wedge of wood was inserted between teeth. As saliva was absorbed, the wood expanded, forcing the teeth apart. Crude and excruciating, perhaps, but it represented a step towards understanding that teeth could be repositioned through pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scientific orthodontics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real scientific orthodontics began with French dentist Pierre Fauchard’s work in 1728. Often called the father of modern dentistry, Fauchard published a landmark two-volume book, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910708601004"&gt;The Surgeon Dentist&lt;/a&gt;, containing the first detailed description of treating malocclusions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He developed the “bandeau” – a curved metal strip wrapped around teeth to widen the dental arch. This was the first tool specifically designed to move teeth using controlled force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fauchard also described using threads to support teeth after repositioning. His work marked the crucial shift from ancient myths and painful experiments to a scientific approach that eventually led to modern braces and clear aligners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With advances in dentistry during the 19th and 20th centuries, orthodontics became a specialist field. Metal brackets, archwires, elastics and eventually stainless steel made treatment more predictable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later innovations – ceramic brackets, lingual braces and clear aligners – made the process more discreet. Today, orthodontics employs digital scans, computer models, and 3D printing for remarkably precise treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of ancient people sporting gold and catgut braces is certainly appealing and dramatic, but it doesn’t match the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient civilisations were aware of dental problems and occasionally attempted simple solutions. Yet they had neither the necessity nor the technology to move teeth as we do now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real story of orthodontics doesn’t begin in the ancient world but with the scientific breakthroughs of the 18th century and beyond – a history that’s fascinating enough without the myths.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

According to the research team, back pain is one of the most common health problems in Norway, with 60-80 percent of people experiencing it during their lifetime. In fact, they say, back and neck pain have the highest medical costs and represent an enormous burden to the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Our findings show the importance of finding time to be physically active in order to prevent not only chronic back pain but many other illnesses as well, which will translate into huge savings for society in the long run,” says NTNU Professor Paul Jarle-Mörck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Preventing Back Pain With Small Measures in Daily Life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The causes of chronic lower back pain are complex. It is thought to develop from a combination of various factors, including aging, poor posture, muscle weakness, and psychological stress. Conventional treatments have focused on medication and physical therapy, making it difficult to reliably prevent recurrence. The effectiveness of walking, a simple and low-cost method, has now been demonstrated, which may spark a major change in common sense regarding lower back pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The benefits of walking are not limited to lower back pain. Walking has a wide range of positive effects, which include improving cardiopulmonary function, maintaining bone density, weight management, and improving mental health. This research supports the comprehensive health benefits of walking, not limited to the single symptom of lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Small everyday changes, such as walking more when commuting or shopping, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, can help prevent back pain. Even for those who already suffer from back pain, these can be effective ways to reduce the risk of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Wear shoes, go outside, and walk. This may be the first step toward a future free of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wired.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRjNxQk43b3QyQWNwSDhWSloxN2ZVbmdhY3JtT2NDNFlPS2hIMGtqV3lubWQ2WmJzVlE1NmtNdXlSZGdPOWRwaW03N293V1FNSndjc3dWdmtxWFJJczVSaWxwVE9tdDI0MUoyQWI1Qy15LWxwbGhDczRZZUNBbzloTFpvTU40RVR4andwSGxzMkFIOVZZ</guid></item><item><title>大脑类器官正在帮助研究人员，但它们的使用也会造成不安- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2026/01/02/nx-s1-5658576/brain-organoids-research-ethics</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Research on conditions like autism, schizophrenia and even brain cancer increasingly relies on clusters of human cells called brain organoids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These pea-size bits of neural tissue model aspects of human brain development as they grow for months and even years in a lab. They also make many people uneasy, in part because the brain is so closely tied to our sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A group of scientists, ethicists, patient advocates and journalists &lt;a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/f6374d3a-7ab1-477d-8445-265e918699c0/summary" target="_blank"&gt;met for two days&lt;/a&gt; in Northern California this fall to discuss how scientists, and society, should proceed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Among the questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it okay to place human organoids in an animal's brain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can organoids feel pain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can they become conscious?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who, if anyone, should regulate this research?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are talking about an organ that is at the seat of human consciousness. It's the seat of personality and who we are," says &lt;a href="https://bioethics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/insoo-hyun" target="_blank"&gt;Insoo Hyun&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the Museum of Science, Boston, who attended the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's reasonable to be especially careful with the kind of experiments we're doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Societal issues by the sea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The event was hosted by &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/sergiu-pasca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Sergiu Pașca&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent organoid researcher whose lab at Stanford University used the technology to develop &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/30/1247900797/timothy-syndrome-genetic-disorder-brain-cells-restored" target="_blank"&gt;a potential treatment&lt;/a&gt; for a rare cause of autism and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Organoids are allowing scientists to study brain cells and circuits that don't exist in animals,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pașca says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have this ability to really work with human neurons and human glial cells," he says, "and ask questions about these really mysterious disorders of the brain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Pașca's work has sometimes caused public unease as his lab has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5358410/pain-pathway-in-a-dish-could-aid-search-for-new-analgesic-drugs" target="_blank"&gt;recreated a human pain pathway&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/10/12/1128356099/human-cells-in-a-rats-brain-could-shed-light-on-autism-and-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;transplanted&lt;/a&gt; a human organoid into the brain of a rat.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Of course, there are issues of ethics and societal implications and religious views that have to be taken into consideration," he says. Many of those issues were outlined in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aeb1510" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Pasca and others in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To take the next step, Pașca invited a group to the Asilomar Conference Center on the Monterey Peninsula. It's the spot where, 50 years earlier, another group met to hash out the first &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv3132" target="_blank"&gt;ethical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Organizers of the organoid event had more modest expectations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our goal for this meeting was to just bring everybody together across all these fields and start brainstorming," Pașca says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That happened — in formal sessions, coffee breaks, after-hours social gatherings and even walks on the beach. And participants brought widely varying perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists and patient advocates at the meeting often emphasized the need to quickly answer questions and find cures.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bioethicists were more likely to speak about the importance of guardrails to make sure people consent to having their cells made into organoids, and to discourage any efforts to enhance the brains of animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was consensus, though, on the need to keep the public informed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When people hear about brain organoid research, they tend to have one overarching and quite reasonable question for scientists, says &lt;a href="https://law.wisc.edu/profiles/ralta.charo" target="_blank"&gt;Alta Charo&lt;/a&gt;, professor emerita of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"How far along are they in building organoids that can actually recapitulate something that we associate with human capacities?" she says. "Have we reached a point where we're worried?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not yet, probably. But the prospect seems closer now that scientists are linking multiple organoids to create more brain-like structures called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40249959/" target="_blank"&gt;assembloids&lt;/a&gt;, Charo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pasca's team, for example, has built a network of four organoids to model the pathway that carries pain signals to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That sounds disturbing, Charo says, unless you understand that this network of cells lacks the circuitry to feel pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The mere existence of the pain pathway, I think, is enough to give a public perception problem that the organoid or the assembloid is suffering," Charo says. "And yet, if the pathway that allows for this emotional aversion doesn't exist, then there's no suffering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And no ethical issue, for now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, she says, researchers and regulators should probably be looking ahead, rather than waiting until there is an actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A perception problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several participants faulted the media for glossing over the current limits on what organoids can do, and for describing these clusters of cells as "mini-brains."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That sort of coverage has led some people to falsely believe there are labs with "brains growing in a petri dish," says &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8945416" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Guo-li Ming&lt;/a&gt;, an organoid researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists need to counter that notion and explain how organoid research is helping people with life-threatening diseases, Ming says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her own lab, for example, is working to customize brain cancer treatment using organoids derived from a patient's own tumor cells. That allows doctors to ensure a cancer drug is effective for the patient's specific tumor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ming also thinks it's too soon to worry about organoids becoming conscious because "we're far from mimicking the brain activity in real human beings."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, organoid scientists "definitely need some guidelines," Ming says, because of current public concern and the potential for inappropriate research in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cells, old issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ethical and societal issues surrounding brain organoids echo those related to stem cell research more than 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Back then, there was concern that neural stem cells might give animals human-like cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It turned out those human cells didn't do well in another species' brain. But organoids, which start out as stem cells, can thrive in animal brains and even integrate with their circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So what used to be a very hot issue in stem cell research has now come back," Hyun says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hyun was part of a group that worked on organoid guidelines for the International Society for Stem Cell Research five years ago, when the need for oversight seemed less pressing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We had a let's wait and see attitude," he says, because it was not clear how long it would take for organoid technology to become concerning. "We've gotten to the point rather quickly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hyun's immediate concern is protecting research animals from organoid experiments that could cause suffering. But in the long term, he says, it may take guidelines and government oversight to ensure that organoid research doesn't harm, or horrify, people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Asilomar meeting suggests many scientists know that, and want help navigating this new scientific frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

Those most at risk include patients with weakened immune systems, people in intensive care units and individuals using medical devices such as catheters or ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current surge has been concentrated in the &lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/topics/united-states" target="_blank" title="united states" rel="noopener"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, public health experts say the spread of drug-resistant fungal infections is a growing global concern. The rise of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/candida-auris-urgent-threat-warning-issued-highly-contagious-drug-resistant-fungus-1714439"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has been cited as part of a wider challenge facing health systems worldwide, including in &lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/topics/europe" target="_blank" title="europe" rel="noopener"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/topics/uk" target="_blank" title="UK" rel="noopener"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is &lt;em&gt;Candida auris &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/candida-auris-urgent-threat-warning-issued-highly-contagious-drug-resistant-fungus-1714439"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a yeast that can cause invasive infections, including bloodstream, wound and ear infections. It was first identified in 2009 and has since been detected in dozens of countries. Unlike many other fungal infections, it primarily affects people who are already seriously ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/unkillable-adenovirus-sweeps-globe-expert-warns-fever-danger-signs-1765594" target="_blank" title="'Unkillable' Adenovirus Sweeps Globe: Expert Warns Of Fever Danger Signs" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; has classified C. auris as an urgent &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/antimicrobial-resistant-fungi/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;antimicrobial resistance threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials say it is particularly concerning because it can spread easily within health care settings and survive for long periods on surfaces and medical equipment, making outbreaks difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="fullCode"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cases Reported in 27 States&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/221842" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data compiled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in late 2025 show that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/candida-auris-urgent-threat-warning-issued-highly-contagious-drug-resistant-fungus-1714439"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has been identified in 27 US states this year alone. The more than 7,000 cases recorded represent a sharp increase compared with previous years and highlight the expanding geographic reach of the fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health authorities note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the figures include both clinical infections, where patients become ill, and colonisation cases, in which the fungus is detected on or in a patient without causing symptoms. Colonised individuals can still spread the organism, particularly in hospitals and care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transmission has been most common in health care facilities, where vulnerable patients are more likely to be exposed. State health departments and the CDC have urged hospitals to strengthen infection prevention measures to limit further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="fullCode"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="fullCode"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="fullCode"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Health Officials are Concerned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/05/29/what-is-candidozyma-auris-fungal-pathogen-and-emerging-global-health-threat/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;NHS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/candida-auris-urgent-threat-warning-issued-highly-contagious-drug-resistant-fungus-1714439"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is difficult to manage for several reasons. Many strains are resistant to multiple classes of antifungal medication, and some appear resistant to all available treatment options. This can leave clinicians with few effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis can also be delayed because standard laboratory tests may misidentify the fungus. In addition, &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; can persist on surfaces for weeks, increasing the risk of prolonged outbreaks in wards and nursing homes. Invasive infections have been linked to high mortality rates among patients who are already critically ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wider Warning on Antifungal Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has warned that the rise of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/candida-auris-urgent-threat-warning-issued-highly-contagious-drug-resistant-fungus-1714439"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reflects a broader increase in antifungal resistance. Officials say the overuse and misuse of antifungal medicines in both medical and agricultural settings have contributed to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers have been advised to follow strict infection control protocols, including enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and patient isolation where necessary. As cases continue to rise, officials say sustained monitoring and prevention efforts will be essential to limit the impact of one of the most challenging drug-resistant pathogens identified in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="filed-under"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>International Business Times UK</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPcWl4RWZicF94UjQ5dzBUUnNvUUJzQWJHZ1J2cUhSMGx1SjdqT25fNlFQUlIyTmtSd2szTE15a2xUR3E3M3J0MDNyWTF2WFJmd0pZQ1QtMDZkVGZrazFPcmNNc1liaXdMWjZZdG5ZVzlEOU9aMnprWDVEX2syY285QlRGSFZIaDVFUk14S0hxS1lzOW1nRmQzUlJyYml0WW1DT1NqMlo1SEdOVVFqdjV4U3ExUERyZWo2Y05v</guid></item><item><title>Brenna Henn想要改进遗传医学。然后她的N.I.H.格兰特被切断了。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/02/science/trump-lostscience-genetics-henn.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:04:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOS3RSME9uSUlsdXVVTWF4eWNCeUhlT1BfejlfNHZoYVRhRXBDLTNNel96cXllWFZ1QmVpX3BuZUhoRXotNE8wSDltdUFWZl8yaG9udHpkVllzNVNlN3dGYmdEdW9WSWRXaWJMRTVlTFhjbENuZ1MzbWRuN2lfaVptYlpyX2EyUQ</guid></item><item><title>什么时候该减少饮酒？留意这些迹象--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/02/well/alcohol-use-disorder-signs-tips.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:01:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOc1JTbENWUDZEdlp3UG5HVWNoZi1KTjlHeFZ1TmFBeWFONGFJSS03YTJfRUpYM1dYeVI5a1RNVU1zeFRDWUFNdXBmRUcwVXpXNGRwc0RQME91eFFYeWhPYjNOYmV0OUpEQjFaY09TZVAtei1kTGpBVENRdm5LLXhEaDBn</guid></item><item><title>一杯橙汁的惊人好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251230-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-a-glass-of-orange-juice</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For instance in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1199383/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, 12 overweight women drank 500ml of orange juice every day for four weeks. At the end of the trial period, the women had significantly lower blood pressure. Although the composition of the gut microbiome itself did not change, the bacteria upped their production of chemicals known as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) – which are known to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="which-orange-juice-is-best?" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="which-orange-juice-is-best?" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Which orange juice is best? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, both nutritionists the BBC spoke to were keen to emphasise that whole fruit remains the preferred option and the healthier choice. Not only do oranges contain more fibre, but they also retain more flavonoids that are so beneficial for health. Polyphenols are the wider class of plant compounds to which flavonoids belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When you eat a fresh orange, the vitamin C and some of the more oxygen-sensitive nutrients [such as flavonoids] don't oxidise as much because they're still encapsulated within the fibre," says Amati.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank"&gt;designated the&lt;/a&gt; 2024-25 flu season &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank"&gt;as the most severe season&lt;/a&gt; since 2017-18. In the UK, the spread has begun earlier than at any time since 2003-04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Against this backdrop, some media &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1rryv2ryo"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; have begun &lt;a data-offer-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-super-flu-and-other-questions-answered-271959" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://theconversation.com/what-is-super-flu-and-other-questions-answered-271959"}' href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-super-flu-and-other-questions-answered-271959" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; the term “super flu.” However, this term is not an official medical term. The actual name is “subclade K,” a new variant of influenza A H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This variant has multiple mutations in a protein on the surface of the virus called hemagglutinin, making it antigenically different from the variants used in existing vaccines. This allows it to partially evade immunity acquired through previous infection or vaccines, making people more susceptible to infection. Genetic analysis by the UK Health Security Agency has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that 87 percent of H3N2 viruses detected since late August 2025 are subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Outbreak Began Earlier Than Usual&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The term “super flu” is not necessarily scientifically accurate. The H3N2 strain already caused severe illness in the elderly and children, and the new mutant strain has not made it more deadly. Contrary to the name, the virus's inherent danger is said to be no different from the conventional H3N2 strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2025, the US influenza pandemic peaked in early February, with active epidemics occurring in 87.3 percent of the country. For 11 consecutive weeks, more than 50 percent of the country &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank"&gt;recorded high epidemic levels&lt;/a&gt;, an anomaly that led to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;287&lt;/a&gt; child deaths. However, these figures reflect the scale of the epidemic and do not imply an increase in the lethality of the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The influenza epidemic is hitting earlier this year in many parts of the world. While the usual peak in Japan occurs between late December and February, in 2025 the epidemic began in earnest at the end of September. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, of the 23 H3 virus strains collected in Japan between September and November 5 that could be analyzed, 22 were subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The reason for the early outbreak is thought to be the decline in immunity of the population due to the countermeasures against &lt;a href="https://wired.jp/tag/covid-19/"&gt;new coronavirus infection (Covid-19)&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a decline in physical strength due to the record-breaking heat wave. During the three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the influenza epidemic was largely suppressed. As a result, it is possible that population immunity to the virus was reduced. In fact, with the 2024 influenza pandemic in Australia &lt;a data-offer-url="https://ausvacs.com.au/2025-flu-vaccination-proposal/2024-flu-season-summary/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://ausvacs.com.au/2025-flu-vaccination-proposal/2024-flu-season-summary/"}' href="https://ausvacs.com.au/2025-flu-vaccination-proposal/2024-flu-season-summary/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at its highest level&lt;/a&gt; since 19 years, it would not be surprising to see a similar trend in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Existing Vaccines Are Effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There has also been much interest in vaccine efficacy in the face of this virulent strain. The vaccine for the 2025-26 season is based on the conventional J.2 lineage (subclade), which has different antigenicity from subclade K. However, early data from the UK has confirmed that 70-75 percent of vaccinated children and 30-40 percent of adults did not end up visiting the emergency room or being hospitalized after infection. This means that even if the antigenicity is not completely identical, the vaccine remains effective in preventing severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The basic prevention measures are the same as for conventional influenza. Vaccination is recommended from October to November before the epidemic, and the effect appears about two weeks after vaccination. It is particularly recommended for people aged 65 and over, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, children aged 6 months to 5 years, and medical workers. In daily life, it is effective to thoroughly wash and disinfect your hands, and wear a mask when in crowds. Ventilation in rooms and maintaining appropriate humidity levels are also important in suppressing viral activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wired.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTUZreGUzMWtUY3lzVVRreW1UNE1tZlNOTzdWTmZWRVF5V2FhVFhucVgwYWhfeGhrRlFibmdyaVZvUW03SVpDSTNqa0ZDNEtDaEh4T0trcG1yNHBJS01KaHRPRmNNbmxUdGFGc3hjUHRfVHdrbjJrbkZZTzk0elFfU1V1MGg1RXc</guid></item><item><title>胰腺癌是最致命的癌症之一。宾夕法尼亚大学正在测试的一种新药给患者和医生带来了希望。-费城当地新闻、体育、就业、汽车、房源</title><link>https://www.inquirer.com/health/pancreatic-cancer-treatment-penn-drug-trial-20260102.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article-body-light "&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Irene Blair was expected to have another six to eight months to live in June, after her pancreatic cancer rapidly advanced to stage 4 less than a year after her initial diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;A new drug being tested in clinical trials around the world, including at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, was the 59-year-old grandmother from Newark, Del.’s best hope for more time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The drug belongs to a class of pharmaceuticals long considered the holy grail of cancer research. It is a KRAS inhibitor, capable of blocking a protein that fuels an especially deadly cancer. Only 13% of pancreatic cancer patients are still alive five years after their diagnosis, the highest mortality rate of all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Called daraxonrasib, the drug is not considered a cure. But the results emerging from clinical trials point to the first major advancement in decades for a devastating cancer usually caught in late stages. Former Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse last week disclosed in a blunt social media post that he was recently diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer and is “gonna die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In recent months, the federal government has sped up the review timeline for the drug made by California-based company Revolution Medicines, Inc., based on early clinical trial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Across 38 patients in a phase 1 trial, the drug appeared to double the survival time for at least half of patients compared to standard chemotherapy, from roughly seven months to 15.6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“In pancreatic cancer, for too long, we haven’t had effective therapies beyond just chemotherapy,” said Mark O’Hara, Blair’s oncologist who leads multiple clinical trials testing KRAS inhibitors at Penn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Blair started the therapy through a phase 3 trial in July. Within three weeks, her cancer-associated pain went away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In October, her tumors looked stable or decreasing on scans.

Blair seeks&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;extra time to “start living life.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;She officially retired from her job in real estate in May and wants to travel, with trips planned to see family in California and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Holidays have been especially hard for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“You just wonder, ‘Will I be here next year?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;How does the therapy work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Cancer researchers have worked to design a drug targeting KRAS, a protein that acts like a “gas pedal” for cancer growth when mutated, since its discovery in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The mutant protein is like a pedal stuck in the down position, driving uncontrolled proliferation — which tumors thrive on. These mutations are found in a quarter of human cancers, mostly aggressive cancers of the pancreas, lung, and colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Scientists finally succeeded in 2021, when the first drugs capable of blocking KRAS were approved by the FDA for lung cancer. Dozens of KRAS inhibitors are now in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;various stages of development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Daraxonrasib is one of the first tested for pancreatic cancer, a tumor type where nearly 90% of cases have these mutations. Also called a ‘pan-RAS inhibitor,’ it not only targets KRAS, but two other related proteins that drive cancer when mutated, HRAS and NRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;More than 90% of the 83 patients in a phase 1 trial saw their pancreatic cancer stall during treatment, and roughly 30% saw shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;While taking the drug, at least half of patients gained more than eight months&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;before the cancer started progressing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The drug comes in the form of three pills, taken daily at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The most prevalent side effect is a rash — 91% of patients in a phase 1 trial experienced this symptom, with 8% having severe cases. It often shows up on the face or scalp and is similar to acne, O’Hara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and mouth sores are other common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;O’Hara said these are manageable with medications for most patients and still allow them to have a better quality of life than chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“I want to be able to give KRAS inhibitors to all my patients right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;O’Hara runs multiple trials of KRAS inhibitors at Penn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Some of them are testing the inhibitor as a treatment for patients with metastatic cancer after other options have stopped working.&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;of her pancreas, spleen, and several lymph nodes, followed by 12 difficult&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;sessions of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;When she finished her last session in March, Blair’s scans showed no evidence of the cancer. But by late April, her back pain returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Two months later, more scans showed that the cancer was now considered stage 4, as it had metastasized to her liver, forming 10 to 15 new tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Her best option was to enter a clinical trial of daraxonrasib at Penn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Much to her relief, she was chosen&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to receive the drug in July upon enrolling in a study in which half of patients are randomized to receive chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“It’s enabled me to start living again,” she said, but knows eventually the therapy will likely stop working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In that case, doctors may try the standard chemotherapy — which usually works for three to four months — or test a different therapy based on her cancer’s genomic profile, O’Hara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;For now, she described herself as “living scan to scan,” seeking as much time as possible with her son, grandchildren, and husband. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Blair’s next evaluation is in February.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A recent review in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; highlights resistant starch — the type naturally found in beans, bananas, and cooled potatoes — as a surprising carb that may improve blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and even support weight management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before eating large amounts of day-old rice, experts say it’s not a magic fix. Adding resistant starch to a diet high in refined carbs and sugar won’t undo the damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, dietitians recommend a bigger-picture approach: Build meals around fiber-rich foods such as legumes, whole grains, and vegetables to support gut health and achieve lasting benefits for blood sugar, cholesterol, and overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, carbohydrates — particularly refined ones found in white bread, pasta, and rice — have been vilified in the wellness world. But a lesser-known type of carb might be ready for a redemption arc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent review of studies in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1636551/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a specific type of starch known as resistant starch may help improve blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and even support weight loss. Even better? You might already have foods containing this starch in your fridge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Resistant starch occurs naturally in foods such as beans, bananas, and potatoes. Cooking and cooling certain starchy foods can also increase their resistant starch content. Think: leftover rice, pasta salad, and cold roasted potatoes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you start chilling every carb in sight, dietitians say the science is more nuanced than social media makes it seem. “The particular benefits of this are significantly overstated,” says &lt;a href="https://desireerd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Desiree Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, RD, host of &lt;a href="https://desireerd.com/podcast/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Allsorts Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and author of the cookbook &lt;a href="https://desireerd.com/books/good-for-your-gut-cookbook/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good for Your Gut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simply adding resistant starch to a diet otherwise rich in ultra-processed foods won’t undo the effects of excessive sugar, refined carbohydrates, or saturated fat. “If you’re looking to add a resistant starch into your pattern of eating in a meaningful way while making sustainable shifts in multiple areas, then you’ll reap the benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://mayafellernutrition.com/people/maya-feller-ms-rd-cdn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maya Feller&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDN. “There’s no way to sugarcoat this. Eating this way has been happening for thousands of years in Indigenous communities.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Should you try to incorporate more resistant starch into your diet? The science is still emerging, but here’s what experts say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-resistant-starch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What is resistant starch? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s a category of carbohydrates that are not digestible,” says Feller. Unlike regular starches, which break down into sugar in the small intestine, resistant starch remains intact and reaches the colon. There, it ferments and feeds your gut bacteria — a process that offers surprising health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-five-types-of-resistant-starch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The five types of resistant starch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are five types of resistant starch, each with a different impact on the body, says Feller: “Depending on the cooking method, the quantity of resistant starch can actually differ, and that is what I think is so exciting.” Here’s the breakdown:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS1:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in whole plant foods such as legumes, whole grains, seeds, and vegetables. Their tough cell walls make them harder to digest, which contributes to their health-promoting properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS2:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in raw, unripe starches such as green bananas, raw potatoes, and uncooked legumes. Their crystalline structure resists digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS3:&lt;/strong&gt; Formed when starchy foods such as rice, bread, or potatoes are cooked and then cooled. Cooking makes the starch digestible, but cooling alters its structure, making it less digestible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS4:&lt;/strong&gt; A synthetic version created by chemically modifying starch. Think of fiber-added snack bars or sugar-free candies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS5: &lt;/strong&gt;Produced through industrial processing, in which starches bind to fats to form indigestible complexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nielsen recommends focusing on RS2 and RS3 sources because they resist digestion differently from RS1, making them more potent prebiotics that ferment in the large intestine — thereby promoting gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-the-potential-health-benefits-of-resistant-starch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What are the potential health benefits of resistant starch? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A long-term study of U.S. adults, published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1004667/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, found that people who ate more resistant starch had a lower risk of dying from cancer or any cause at all (besides cardiovascular disease). The study followed participants for 19 years and demonstrated a strong correlation between resistant starch consumption and improved health outcomes. That said, researchers note that we still need more studies to determine precisely how much to eat for the greatest benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We used to say, ‘We are what we eat,’ but now the thinking is, ‘We are what we digest and absorb.’” says Nielsen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424112/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2024, found that rats fed mung beans, a high-resistance-starch food, had a 96% reduction in blood sugar. Among humans, a small 2015 study published in the journal Nutrition of people classified as overweight or obese showed that consuming 15 to 30 grams of resistant starch per day was linked to improved insulin sensitivity in overweight men but not in women, suggesting that more research is needed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6551340/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; Nielsen cites found that 10 to 45 grams of resistant starch per day improved insulin sensitivity among people classified as overweight or obese. “When people have a pattern of eating that is higher in fiber in general, including resistant starches, they tend to have better blood sugar control, lower blood pressure, and a lower lipid profile,” says Feller.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with high cholesterol, Feller recommends adding a wide variety of fiber to your diet — including resistant starch — to help improve your numbers. Once those lab results start moving in the right direction, she says, other benefits often follow: better sleep, clearer thinking, and, for many people, a bit of weight loss, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sort of. But don’t expect miracles from day-old rice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Is it significant? It’s not as big as you expect,” says Nielsen. Cooling rice can double its resistant starch content after 24 hours in the fridge, but the total amount isn’t huge on either side: It rises from about 1.2 grams to 2.4 grams. “It’s great, but not a huge difference,” says Nielsen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead, dietitians recommend increasing your overall fiber intake by eating more nuts, legumes, produce, and whole grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “What actually matters is what you pair with the rice,” says Feller. “So if you're eating white, black, brown, or red rice, are you having beans with it? Are you having non-starchy vegetables?”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To see potential blood sugar benefits, aim for 10 to 40 grams per day, says Nielsen. For people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), even five grams of RS2 (such as green bananas or raw potato starch) can positively affect gut bacteria without triggering excessive bloating. However, more than 10 to 20 grams may be too much for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook rice, pasta, or potatoes, then chill for 24 hours before eating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze sliced bread, then toast slices as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap half a cup of wheat flour for &lt;a href="https://store.edwardandsons.com/products/organic-banana-flour" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green banana flour&lt;/a&gt; in baked goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add green banana flour to smoothies (with extra liquid to promote digestion).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;a href="https://manitobaharvest.com/collections/hemp-hearts" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;hemp hearts&lt;/a&gt; to smoothies or yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat the rinds of soft squashes and skins of potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, especially if your current diet is low in fiber. Suddenly loading up on resistant starch (especially from raw legumes or green banana flour) can cause bloating, gas, or worse. Nielsen recommends introducing it slowly to keep digestion moving.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After talking to three different cardiologists, we gathered the best, safer alternatives to concerning kitchen materials such as microplastics and PFAS, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bentgo-Signature-Leak-Proof-Glass-Storage/dp/B0F122SZ82/?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;plastic-free containers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B087XBR564?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reusable silicone bags&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bees-Wrap-Reusable-Beeswax-Extra/dp/B08BWVXP6Y?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;beeswax wrap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Classic-10-Piece-Cookware-Stainless/dp/B0FQD52NTK?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stainless steel cookware&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-Skillet-Silicone/dp/B00G2XGC88/?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cast-iron cookware&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All three doctors expressed concern about materials such as microplastics, lead and PFAS. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors want you to remember that swaps should be sustainable, realistic changes based on your budget and specific needs, and encourage you to prioritize your heart health in a variety of ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new year is a great time for change—it’s exactly why resolutions came to be. And if you ask me, 2026 already has a strong theme: Many people want to make better choices for themselves, whether that’s the food they eat or the exercise they commit to. I am the same way, which is why I’ve been reaching out to experts for their advice. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommended-kitchen-gadgets-amazon-11762566" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cardiologists have some of the most fascinating perspectives&lt;/a&gt;, as cardiovascular health intersects with many different aspects of our well-being. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In light of what was one of the biggest topics of 2025—kitchen toxins &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-limit-microplastics-in-your-food-11713723" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;like microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, PFAS (aka forever chemicals), lead and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/banned-flame-retardants-found-in-cooking-utensils-8723612" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;flame retardants&lt;/a&gt;—I asked three cardiologists for their honest advice: Do these materials interact with heart health? What should we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; avoid and why? And how can we do this in a manageable way? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After polling cardiologists, doctors were most concerned about three well-known toxins: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fda-lead-leaching-cookware-replacements-amazon-11833814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, plastics, and forever chemicals., Specifically, two out of the three doctors said microplastics were their biggest worry, while one flagged lead and PFAS. What ties these three together is that they can adversely impact heart health, and there are manageable ways to reduce your daily exposure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “My goal as a cardiologist is not to create fear, but to help people make practical, evidence-based choices that fit into real life and meaningfully support long-term heart health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/juan-c-rozo/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nocaes"&gt;Dr. Juan Carlos Rozo, MD, FACC, FASE, RPVI&lt;/a&gt; at Houston Methodist Hospital. “I am concerned, but in a measured, evidence-based way. For Dr. Rozo, his biggest concern is with lead and PFAS since we have the most data to support them, noting that “these [materials] are all well-recognized drivers of cardiovascular disease.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The average person may be ingesting tens of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/common-products-sources-of-microplastics-11863406" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; annually,” he notes. &lt;a href="https://bestheartbeat.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow nocaes"&gt;Dr. Andrew Rudin, MD&lt;/a&gt;, agrees, adding that “these plastics contain chemicals that can disrupt endocrine function as well as cause inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-heart-disease-risk-11833680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and cancer.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Patients can take meaningful action to reduce microplastic exposure more readily than they can address some other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/forever-chemicals-endocrine-disruptors-expert-kitchen-swaps-amazon-11795890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it an ideal starting point for those who feel overwhelmed about where to begin," says Dr. Martinez-Clark. We’ve tested a wide range of different &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/50233/must-have-kitchen-tools/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;kitchen gear&lt;/a&gt;, many of which can be considered safer alternatives to products containing microplastics, lead or PFAS.

I have been testing them at home for four months, and I really appreciate how durable and airtight they are. Whether I store food in the freezer, refrigerator or pantry, the lid’s seal ensures food stays fresh for days on end. Because there’s no plastic, I never worry about keeping food frozen and stored inside, even if it's for months at a time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Buying Bee’s Wrap wraps was one of the smartest things I did in 2025. When I was looking for an option to replace most use cases for plastic wrap, I immediately jumped on buying this cut-it-yourself roll. It’s made with organic cotton, beeswax, organic plant oils and tree resin. The sheets seal with the warmth of your hands, and you can wash them with cold water and soap and reuse them time and time again.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, plastic cutting boards get nicked up from your knives, increasing your chances of ingesting microplastics. Investing in a nice &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-wooden-cutting-boards-8639594" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wooden cutting board&lt;/a&gt; is a great option to grab for most prep, and John Boos makes some of the best on the market. I’ve used these everywhere from professional kitchens to at-home set-ups, and they always hold up. This model is a good starting point for the brand. It’s made with maple wood, is 1 inch thick for durability and lasts for years with proper care.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cookware, reaching for simple materials like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-stainless-steel-cookware-8706088" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. We love Calphalon pans for their design, durability and fair price. This set is an excellent choice for many cooking applications. The 10-inch frying pan sears and sautés beautifully, while the 2.5-quart saucepan bubbles sauces and heats food with ease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cooking tools, I always recommend these wooden spatulas for a true multi-tasking option. The slim design and hard edges make it excellent for scraping, tossing, stirring, flipping and more. Once you have one of these, you’ll likely reach for it over every other tool. They’re handmade from wood and have lasted me for years, even with daily use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Doctors want to reiterate that they don’t want you to make a 180-degree change, and that this isn’t the only way to manage heart health. Always do what works best for you and your budget. “Perfect is the enemy of good. I counsel my patients to focus on high-impact, sustainable changes rather than trying to eliminate every possible risk, which is both impossible and can create unhealthy anxiety,” says Dr. Martinez-Clark.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPNDdSN3NnWWJDUm9ocnFZOXpzN3ZMWGp6MHB3RV9feTI4Qy1RVHZSTlRnYUNmbjdXcGt0RGlnSTZNdnFfdF9FUEJveHpfampZazQyV3E4QzRXdnhtWUZFaHRtYUdGVmh2a25yaFUwMDFWUFhHcHBGMUp3eDl3Mm9fVU1MUTRBWWhBMm0w</guid></item><item><title>不要紧张，少做事： 2026年让生活更轻松的52种方法-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/01/ways-to-make-your-life-easier-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he dawn of a new year brings visions of an idealised version of yourself. Fresh-faced, we eagerly pile our to-do lists with things we’ve been putting off and ambitions to aim for. But the energy that comes after a few days off quickly disappears as we settle back into the daily grind of school runs and inbox maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So instead of adding to your to-do list, why not resolve to take something off it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="daily-tasks" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Daily tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;1. Professional organiser Susan C Pinsky says you &lt;strong&gt;don’t need to fold&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;every piece of clothing&lt;/strong&gt;. A drawer of jumbled underwear, but only underwear, is organised enough. For extra credit, if you reduce your socks to two styles and have multiple pairs of each, you will never need to sort, match or roll your socks again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Stop sending so many emails&lt;/strong&gt;, says Moyra Scott, a productivity and wellbeing expert. The more you send, the more you get back, so only reply if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;3. Another reason to stay out of your inbox? Organisational psychologist Dr Amantha Imber says this kind of “shallow work”, which also includes messaging over Slack or Teams, &lt;strong&gt;wastes energy that could be put towards bigger tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Skip that multivitamin&lt;/strong&gt;. People should stop wasting their money on health supplements, says Dr Jason Yu, a Sydney-based GP. They often have very minimal scientific evidence to support their claims, and a pill can’t correct unhealthy lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a08df11f-34f8-4126-a60d-e29a9e2a6453" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is it true that … you’re more likely to get sick when you’re stressed?","elementId":"a08df11f-34f8-4126-a60d-e29a9e2a6453","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/29/is-it-true-sick-stressed-ill"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;5. You don’t need a complicated outfit to look stylish, says Zara Wong, a fashion editor and consultant. The easiest way to look put together is to &lt;strong&gt;wear the same colour head to toe.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not only striking, but a paint-by-numbers way of getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;6. Forgo moisturiser and&lt;strong&gt; just wear sunscreen&lt;/strong&gt;, says Prof Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at the Skin Hospital. Sebaratnam says most people don’t need to routinely wear moisturiser unless they have skin conditions like eczema. Plus, most sunscreens have moisturising properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;7. Similarly, you only need to &lt;strong&gt;use one or two well-formulated products&lt;/strong&gt; with a few active ingredients to tackle specific skin concerns, says Michelle Wong, a science communicator with a PhD in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;8. Put your phone down and &lt;strong&gt;stop looking at your investments,&lt;/strong&gt; says superannuation specialist Marco Mellado. Prices move constantly, with no clear rhyme or reason. If you have a solid long-term plan, daily fluctuations don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;9. People use too much of every spice when cooking south Asian meals. &lt;strong&gt;Using fewer spices in the right quantities&lt;/strong&gt; can bring out deeper flavours, says Nipun Liyanapathirana, culinary creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Take the shame out of your dinner&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s so much pressure on home cooks to make something special every night, says Bundjalung restaurateur Mindy Woods. But many food cultures don’t cook for applause. They cook to nourish, sustain and carry people through the day. If that means repeating a meal, remind yourself that feeding you and your family well is already a worthy feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;11. If your room is always a mess, stop setting yourself up for failure by promising you’ll start putting your clothes away at the end of each day, says Guardian reporter and author of &lt;a href="https://tr.ee/jEhBx3mVxq" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The ADHD Brain Buddy&lt;/a&gt; Matilda Boseley. Instead, designate a “clothes chair” in your room or put a “clean clothes” basket next to your washing basket. &lt;strong&gt;Give yourself permission to be messy&lt;/strong&gt; – just give that mess a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cd4c778-fb2d-4fb7-b298-5f1753817624" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="getting-through-the-week" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Getting through the week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;12. Many parents try to smooth every bump, rushing in to fix and protect, says Alice Peel, a primary school teacher and co-founder of mental health social venture Grow Your Mind. But &lt;strong&gt;letting your child solve their own problems&lt;/strong&gt; gives them an opportunity to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;13. Let your garden take care of itself, too. &lt;strong&gt;Stop spraying pesticides and insecticides unnecessarily&lt;/strong&gt;, says nursery manager Thea Kerr. They interfere with the garden’s ecosystem and aphid populations can be controlled naturally by predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;14. &lt;strong&gt;Embrace gentle movement when recovering from an intense workout&lt;/strong&gt;. Although it’s tempting to push through when you’re sore, it often delays recovery, says associate professor Bruno Saragiotto, head of physiotherapy at the University of Technology, Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;15. Exercise doesn’t need to involve overly complicated moves either, says Dr Kim Way, an exercise physiologist at Deakin University. &lt;strong&gt;Stick to simple exercises that you enjoy&lt;/strong&gt; and feel confident doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;16. And &lt;strong&gt;if cool-downs are a drag, you can skip them&lt;/strong&gt;, says Shona Vertue, a personal trainer and yoga instructor. Contrary to popular belief, research indicates that active cool-downs don’t significantly reduce muscle soreness, prevent injuries, or improve recovery in a meaningful way after weight training. But if you enjoy winding down after a workout, by all means keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;17. Do you end the week with aching feet? Charbel Dagher, a podiatrist from Clear Step Podiatry, says &lt;strong&gt;your shoes probably aren’t the problem, or the solution&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people over-rely on cushioned shoes or insoles for a quick fix. Addressing the underlying causes of foot pain will do more in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;18. Streamline your grocery shop. &lt;strong&gt;Delicious dishes don’t need lots of ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; and according to Jo Barrett, chef at Discovered Foods, we buy too many. Look for recipes that only require a handful of ingredients and a method you feel confident following – these often end up being the most memorable meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;19. &lt;strong&gt;Stop wasting money on probiotics bought off the shelves&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, grow your own gut flora by eating a diet that is rich in low-processed, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/17/15-easy-delicious-eat-more-legumes-pulses-beans" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;plant-based ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, says Prof Emad El-Omar, a gastroenterologist and director of the University of New South Wales Microbiome Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;20. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t overload your laundry with commercial stain removers&lt;/strong&gt;. Not every product works for every stain. Shannon Lush, know as the queen of clean, suggests working out the cause of a spot before tackling it, lest you accidentally set it. You probably have everything you need to get rid of it at home already. Bicarb soda and water brightens whites, while white vinegar lifts greasy stains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;21. Everything loses its appeal once it lands on a to-do list. &lt;strong&gt;Stop scheduling sex like it’s a chore&lt;/strong&gt;, says Georgia Grace, sex and relationship practitioner. It adds pressure to the moment and can make it feel performative rather than pleasurable. Instead, schedule intentional time to connect physically, emotionally, or erotically without the expectation that it must lead to sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="700e41d6-1d96-4e16-ba7e-6d30e7abf350" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="enjoying-yourself" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Enjoying yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;22. &lt;strong&gt;Forget the fancy gadgets and complicated brew methods&lt;/strong&gt;, says Jibbi Little, a coffee professional. You only need one thing for a good cup of joe: high quality beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;23&lt;strong&gt;. You don’t have to grit your teeth trying to finish art you hate&lt;/strong&gt;, says Guardian Australia culture editor Steph Harmon. If you don’t like the first 20 pages of a book, stop reading it. If you’re bored by a film or TV show, switch it off. Leaving a terrible play at intermission is exhilarating. There’s more brilliant culture out there than anyone could possibly see in one lifetime, so cut your losses and find something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;24. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t worry about staying for a whole party&lt;/strong&gt;, says Jenny Valentish, journalist and reformed sociophobe. Recognise that you have a window of tolerance, spend quality time with the host, then leave once the party gets going if you’re not feeling up to it. It’s better to be around for a good time rather than a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;25. &lt;strong&gt;Stop comparing your sex life to others&lt;/strong&gt;. Do what works for you and the people you are in a relationship with, says clinical sexologist Naomi Hutchings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;26. And during the act itself, &lt;strong&gt;let go of what your sexual partners might think of you or your body &lt;/strong&gt;and focus on how your body feels. This will help keep you present and increase your pleasure, says Kassandra Mourikis, sexologist and relationship therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;27. For overseas visitors, friends with kids or big group hangs, organising a time to meet can be excruciating. &lt;strong&gt;Replace the never-ending back and forth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;texts&lt;/strong&gt; with a&lt;a href="https://www.when2meet.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; when2meet&lt;/a&gt; link, says Isabella Lee, production assistant at Guardian Australia. This handy site lets people pick the days and times that work for them, then suggests the best dates based on everyone’s availabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;28. Don’t try to see everything when you go on holiday. It adds pressure you don’t need, says Intrepid Travel’s managing director ANZ, Brett Mitchell. Instead of racing between highlights, &lt;strong&gt;go to fewer, less-visited places&lt;/strong&gt;. Doing less doesn’t mean missing out – it’s often how you experience more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="469bbfa5-e67c-4485-8bf0-c4d168b24c3b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":36,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The perfect morning routine: how to build a happy, healthy start to the day – from showers to sunshine","elementId":"469bbfa5-e67c-4485-8bf0-c4d168b24c3b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/perfect-morning-routine-happy-healthy-start-showers-sunshine"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;29. &lt;strong&gt;Give yourself a day of grace when returning from a trip&lt;/strong&gt;, says Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor at Guardian Australia. Going to work the day after you land just loads your future self with extra chores. If you plan a day at home to sleep, unpack, get groceries and settle in, your holiday will still feel like a holiday when it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;30. Take the goon bag off the hills hoist and prepare your finest glassware. Sommelier Samantha Payne says &lt;strong&gt;you don’t need to spend big to drink well&lt;/strong&gt;. Quality cask wine has come leaps and bounds &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/24/australia-best-cask-wines-taste-test-sommelier-samantha-payne" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, and keeping some in the fridge means you can have a glass of wine without opening a whole bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;31. Coco Chanel is often credited with the adage that before you leave the house, you should take one thing off. The same idea applies to arranging your home, says interior designer Emma Blomfield. Many people over-accessorise flat surfaces and wind up with a space that looks messy and overdone. &lt;strong&gt;Stick to having just three to four pieces on display &lt;/strong&gt;and you’ll have less to dust too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;32. &lt;strong&gt;Kids don’t need elaborate birthday parties or gifts&lt;/strong&gt;. For many toddlers and primary-school aged children, a park play and cake will do just fine, says Guardian deputy lifestyle editor Yvonne C Lam. If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; put on a do, try a “fiver” party – in lieu of gifts, ask guests to pop $5 in an envelope, which can go towards one item your child wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;33. If you’re trying to grow your social circle, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t need to worry about making a best friend&lt;/strong&gt;, says Michelle Lim, associate professor of public health at the University of Sydney. Small moments of connection, like saying hello to someone at the bus stop, can do a lot to alleviate loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;34. Don’t worry about dressing for your age, your body, or for how other people might view you, says fashion sustainability adviser Camille Reed. &lt;strong&gt;Just wear what makes you happy&lt;/strong&gt;. She says: “Wear the bright colours. Show the arms. Dress to impress you!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-things-go-wrong" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;When things go wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;35. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t feed your pet before a trip to the vet&lt;/strong&gt;. Going to the doctor is already a stressful experience, says Anne Quain, a senior lecturer at the Sydney school of veterinary science at University of Sydney, so don’t add the complication of a big meal prior. Eating makes your animal more likely to get sick in the car and, if they arrive on an empty stomach, they’ll be more receptive to treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;36. &lt;strong&gt;If you find yourself out of work, don’t take a “spraying and praying” approach&lt;/strong&gt; by applying for every job you see, says Ellen Hooper, a career coach. Instead, Hooper recommends spending time contacting former colleagues and using existing networks to search for job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;37. If you’ve got deep-seated anxieties about money, &lt;strong&gt;influencer tips and get rich quick schemes won’t help you&lt;/strong&gt;, says Zee Heart, co-founder of MoneyGirl.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t fall for them – unfollow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;38. If you’re in a tough spot, stop dieting, says KC Davis, self-care advocate and author of Who Deserves Your Love. Your brain runs on glucose, so a crisis is not the time to skip the carbs, fat or protein. &lt;strong&gt;Focus on getting enough calories into your body&lt;/strong&gt;, not on whether your meals are nutritionally perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;39. Embrace a bit of healthy conflict, says Marryam Chehelnabi, clinical psychotherapist. Avoiding a fight backs us into a corner and restricts us from fostering happiness and connection, so instead of tying yourself in knots trying to keep the peace, &lt;strong&gt;air your grievances when they come up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;40. &lt;strong&gt;You don’t need to fill awkward silences to ease someone’s grief&lt;/strong&gt;, says Sally Douglas and Imogen Carn, creators of the Good Mourning podcast. Instead of offering solutions or platitudes, the most powerful support can be simply sitting beside someone, listening without judgment and allowing space for their grief to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="50ae66e3-0689-4162-8aad-7bd5456712df" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="planning-for-the-future" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Planning for the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;41. If you’re planning a renovation, &lt;strong&gt;don’t overlook orientation&lt;/strong&gt;, says Anthony Burke, host of ABC’s Grand Designs Australia and architecture professor at University of Technology, Sydney. Maximising the advantages of the sun for natural heating and cooling means you can hopefully forgo air conditioning and additional insulation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;42. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t design your home for the next buyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Too many houses feel like copies of each other: on-trend, forgettable and designed with resale in mind, says interior designer David Flack. Your home isn’t a showroom, it’s where life happens; design for yourself&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;43. Don’t obsess over self-optimisation and biohacking. It feels like taking control, but it’s often just repackaging anxiety and control as data points, says clinical psychologist Zac Seidler. Sometimes good enough really is good enough – &lt;strong&gt;your body isn’t an algorithm to hack&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec788e07-472a-436e-b2bc-0b365a8ecff3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":55,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The secrets of the body clock: how to tune into your natural rhythms – and have a better day","elementId":"ec788e07-472a-436e-b2bc-0b365a8ecff3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/secrets-body-clock-natural-rhythms-better-day"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;44. We all have that one item we can’t get rid of for sentimental reasons, but when you’re decluttering, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to hold on to things out of obligation&lt;/strong&gt;. If you no longer want or use something, professional organiser Catherine Carney says it’s OK to appreciate the thought and let the item go without feeling guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;45. &lt;strong&gt;Stop planning your career to the exact detail&lt;/strong&gt;, says Lois Keay-Smith, a career counselling practitioner. The modern career is all about adaptability, information and making connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;46. There are plenty of metrics that go along with parenting, but many are best ignored, says Dr Fiona Longmuir, senior lecturer in educational leadership at Monash university. &lt;strong&gt;Stop focusing on data outputs as measures of success for children&lt;/strong&gt; and instead think about developing them as young humans, as opposed to A+ students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-you-need-a-reality-check" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;When you need a reality check&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;47. &lt;strong&gt;Stop holding your partner responsible for your own “stuff”&lt;/strong&gt; says Dr Orna Guralnik, clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. Our emotions are our responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;48. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t live to post&lt;/strong&gt;. When every move we make can end up at the mercy of the internet, it’s tempting to play it safe, say Maggie Kelly and Tully Smyth, co-hosts of the Self Help(ed) podcast. But we should worry less about our online “social contracts”. Your digital footprint doesn’t define you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;49. Parents spend too much energy trying to shape their children’s behaviour, says Lael Stone, a parenting educator. &lt;strong&gt;Children learn most from watching who we are&lt;/strong&gt;, not what we say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;50. &lt;strong&gt;Let go of ageist beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;, says Dr Catherine Barrett, founder of Celebrate Ageing. When you see the value in older people, it transforms your experience of interacting and working with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;51. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t worry about what others around you are doing&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to live a life guided by Stoic philosophy, understand that what other people do or say is out of your control, says author and journalist Brigid Delaney. All you need to worry about is how you are acting and responding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;52. If all else fails, &lt;strong&gt;just stop saying yes&lt;/strong&gt;, says Helena Nguyen, a professor in work and organisational studies at the University of Sydney. People-pleasers be warned: each yes is a little withdrawal from your energy account and you can’t show up well for others if you’re emotionally overdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

However, what about foods that slowly damage your brain? According to Dr. Austin Perlmutter, MD, it is not refined carbs, or fried food, but something you consume on a daily basis, almost every day—yes, we are talking about sugar, and specifically liquid sugar, aka sugary drinks. Let's take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of sugar-rich beverages and sweetened foods leads to brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40902134/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; through gradual processes when these items are consumed every day. The brain functions through a few essential elements which include memory, mood, focus and dementia risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Unhealthy 5 letter foods you should avoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The process of sugar entering your brain system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumption of cola, packaged juice, energy drinks and sweet tea leads to fast sugar entry into the blood and brain. Your body needs to produce a large amount of insulin when blood sugar levels rise suddenly, and this process occurs multiple times throughout years which leads to brain insulin resistance. The brain depends on glucose for its operation but requires a continuous and controlled flow of this substance, instead of experiencing rapid increases and decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High sugar intake over several years causes brain cell &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11446400/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by triggering inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweet drinks, kids’ brains, and attention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early exposure to sugary drinks is especially harmful for young, developing brains. Studies connect high intake of sugar-sweetened drinks in babies and children with more attention and behavior problems later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large Korean cohort study showed that children who consumed more than 200 ml of sugary drinks daily, before their second birthday developed ADHD at a higher rate than children who drank less. Other studies in Spain and China report that frequent soft drink intake in school-age children links to higher ADHD risk and poorer cognitive performance scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Memory loss and thinking problems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prolonged intake of large sugar amounts results in detrimental effects that harm memory functions, learning abilities and information processing capabilities. Symptoms like brain fog and poor focus will appear first before the condition advances to its next stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies based on cohort data show that children who drink too many sugary beverages at a young age, will achieve lower IQ levels as adults based on their cognitive test performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who drink too much sugar and sweetened beverages, face health dangers that harm their brain function because these drinking habits raise their risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt; do not help much&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching from sugar to “zero-calorie” sweeteners may not fully protect the brain.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Trying to lose weight can feel overwhelming, especially when it seems like your favorite foods are off-limits. While no single food causes weight loss, small, realistic changes can make it easier to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-not-losing-weight-in-a-calorie-deficit-11773522" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain a calorie deficit&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One simple option is choosing lower-carb versions of everyday staples, like bread.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that you don’t need to follow a low-carb diet to lose weight.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, swapping in a lower-carb bread can modestly reduce calories for those who regularly eat toast or sandwiches, without giving up foods you enjoy.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of bread can make it easier to lower calories without feeling restricted,” explains Pratt. Because the bread contains added fibers that may be harder for some people to tolerate at first, she suggests starting with one slice and seeing how your digestion responds before increasing your portion.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Low-carb bread isn’t required for weight loss, but it can be a helpful tool for some people—especially if it makes meals more satisfying while slightly reducing calories. “Think of low-carb bread as one option that can support you if it helps you meet your protein and fiber goals while still enjoying your food,” says Sheth.

&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are raising concerns after a study uncovered a link between microplastics and biological changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11010-025-05428-3" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that microplastics may trigger cellular responses tied to conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/news/2025/12/five-ways-microplastics-may-harm-your-brain" target="_blank"&gt;University of Technology Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and Auburn University examined how microplastics interact with brain cells and found that these particles may disrupt cellular pathways linked to neurodegenerative disease progression. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the research team, exposure prompted inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction — all classic hallmarks observed in degenerative brain disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-5ca2ac36aaf8acb099635c8cb9bc95f1 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-5ca2ac36aaf8acb099635c8cb9bc95f1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7abb69fd07938c05e8c07aeda29d23bf theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-7abb69fd07938c05e8c07aeda29d23bf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-122df6b5d1f16bd3aac1e2e36b0c497b theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-122df6b5d1f16bd3aac1e2e36b0c497b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-2b52da2a8532dfa3a9d24a340d0e97a8 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-2b52da2a8532dfa3a9d24a340d0e97a8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-0c5df05f83e2b0404bde452825c33d5e theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-0c5df05f83e2b0404bde452825c33d5e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Microplastics actually weaken the blood–brain barrier, making it leaky. Once that happens, immune cells and inflammatory molecules are activated, which then causes even more damage to the barrier's cells," said UTS Associate Professor Kamal Dua in a &lt;a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/news/2025/12/five-ways-microplastics-may-harm-your-brain" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-c2d9367163c8c5b01c9ec0e51c0975e3 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-c2d9367163c8c5b01c9ec0e51c0975e3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-these-findings-concerning"&gt;Why are these findings concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the pathways affected are deeply tied to cognitive decline, the research raises the possibility that exposure to microplastics over the long term could amplify the risk or severity of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24976-neurodegenerative-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; — a major health burden already affecting millions of families around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-daabf111a7f59200f1814d5c72e059e5 theco-embedded-video" id="theco-daabf111a7f59200f1814d5c72e059e5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings add to what we already know about the harm &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-human-health-guide/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; can have on human health. Researchers have found &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-human-brains-nanoplastics-plastic-waste/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastics in human brain samples&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered evidence that they &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastic-fibers-lung-damage-study/" target="_blank"&gt;affect our lung tissue&lt;/a&gt;, and learned they appear to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-endometrial-cancer-research-women/" target="_blank"&gt;contribute to endometrial cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers warn that the amount of microplastic exposure we have can vary, but the observed effects mirror what happens in human brain tissue during disease progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-f4fa2820f656b8fbf7a0f31956001e60 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-f4fa2820f656b8fbf7a0f31956001e60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Communities already facing disproportionate exposure to pollution — including residents in industrial countries, near waste-processing sites, and in regions dependent on bottled water — may be even more vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-about-this-threat"&gt;What's being done about this threat?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address the growing problem of microplastics, we need better efforts to curb plastic production, increased &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/indian-river-lagoon-microplastics-airborne-rocket-fuel/" target="_blank"&gt;monitoring of microplastics&lt;/a&gt; in the environment, and investment in technologies that &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-drinking-water-filter/" target="_blank"&gt;remove microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; from water systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals can also make lifestyle changes to help reduce exposure to microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"We need to change our habits and use less plastic," &lt;a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/news/2025/12/five-ways-microplastics-may-harm-your-brain" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; study co-author Dr. Keshav Raj Paudel. "Steer clear of plastic containers and plastic cutting boards, don't use the dryer, choose natural fibers instead of synthetic ones and eat less processed and packaged foods." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-b83196f52db90537c639b26c88ebc6c0 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-b83196f52db90537c639b26c88ebc6c0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" target="_blank"&gt;Using less plastic&lt;/a&gt; and supporting policies that limit industrial plastic pollution can help, too. The researchers behind the study stress that preventing microplastics from entering ecosystems — and bodies — is ultimately the most effective safeguard of human health in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

The collection had accrued over the course of several years, picked up – and then swiftly dropped. Health sprees that &lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/century-of-fad-diets-history-weight-loss-trends-b2689369.html"&gt;only had a hefty bill&lt;/a&gt; from Holland &amp;amp; Barrett to show for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of us are susceptible to the idea that&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/collagen-food-diet-supplements-b2717960.html"&gt; “investing” in our health&lt;/a&gt; equates to spending hard-earned cash to prove to ourselves that we’re serious. The unworn trainers or expensive yoga pants, the unused gym membership (a cliché because it’s true) – and, for others like me, a huge box of very good intentions, rattling around the drawer under the bathroom sink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I clear out everything best before 2022 (or, in some cases, 2019)? Yes. Did I also reignite the urge to buy more? Naturally. Like most people, I’d also been recently caught in the TikTok wellness trap, where everyone appears to have the answers, no matter what their credentials. Powdered greens – a dietary supplement of vegetables, fruits and algae which claims to be a concentrated dose of nutrients – appeared to be a brilliantly easy panacea, as did &lt;a href="/topic/supplements"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; I’d never previously taken notice of – milk thistle, to cleanse a tired liver for a tenner, or ashwagandha to lower blood pressure and anxiety, and collagen for pretty much everything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need pointing out that the platform has very little merit in the health world, yet sales of beauty and wellness products such as supplements are through the roof on ever-influential TikTok Shop – and this is big business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the supplements industry, health really is wealth. Over the last 15 years, the over-the-counter &lt;a href="/topic/vitamins"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals market has grown exponentially, generating more than £650m in UK sales in 2024. In the US, it’s far higher, with one of the more conservative estimates suggesting Americans will be swallowing $70bn of supplements by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, unsurprising. Five years ago, we lived through an unprecedented global health crisis that, when life was boiled down to the bare basics, gave us all a thorough wake-up call. Covid led us all to reconsider our perceptions of health, the way we live and, crucially, how we prevent ourselves from getting ill. Naturally, many people turned to quick-fix supplements – and sales were their highest in more than a decade; almost twice the amount sold nationally last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is what the supplement sector thrives on – but as to whether they work, it’s a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One size does not fit all &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should think about taking supplements like a prescription,” says registered nutritional therapist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gqjordannutrition"&gt;GQ Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the time, we’re conditioned to think that taking supplements, whatever they are, must be safeguarding or improving our health. We forget that health – existing or genetically predisposed conditions, our levels of fitness and diet – is not an equal starting point for all of us. Additionally, some over-the-counter vitamins and minerals can interact with medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another; everyone has their own signs and symptoms of what they might be lacking, probably the first thing to do is to track those to see if there’s any consistency. So, if you’re waking up in the night consistently or having an energy dip in the afternoon, it might be a good sign to consider taking some magnesium or vitamin D to see if they help,” advises Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 qgomz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-256740"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If at all possible, Jordan says, speak to your GP about your own health status before deciding what you need supplementing, and before sinking a load of cash into your local pharmacy. Or, if that’s not possible and you can afford to, put that money towards seeing a nutritionist. Getting goodness through diet is more sustainable in the long run because of how things are broken down in our gut. Some supplements aren’t suitable for people with underlying health concerns, especially when it comes to the liver, which must process everything you put in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that your requirements will change depending on your current situation. As we age, our hormones change drastically, which can change what we need and how much of it is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all supplements are made equal &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from it. Supplements, says Lynsey Vaughan, nutritionist and product innovation lead at wellness brand &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.highernature.com%2Fpages%2Four-story%3F_gl%3D1%2A6w73fg%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_gs%2AMQ..%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwkZm_BhDrARIsAAEbX1EmG8buaB6PRaZzLVF2Wm9Rieu9dTWLYwJ4J9Ys3BCibB2hnVF79IoaApkFEALw_wcB%26gbraid%3D0AAAAAD_kRq7f59ux-F7N4wZkZOUZIbnBQ&amp;amp;articleId=b2886411&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Higher Nature, &lt;/a&gt;which is “committed to unmasking the world of supplements”. “There are a few things to keep in mind,” Vaughan explains, particularly whether the capsule or tablet is made of natural ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A non-active ingredient might be the physical shell that you put the ingredients into, and then there are also excipients, which is an industry term for non-active ingredients. Not all supplements have them in – and many don’t have the right amount in. For a good supplement, you want the actual ingredient, limited non-active and synthetic ingredients, and to get the right dose. There are many that I come across where I’ll look at the formula and think, ‘What is that even doing?’ Often there’s no real benefit at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="You can’t out-supplement a bad diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-256741"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;You can’t out-supplement a bad diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in ultra-processed foods, look at how many ingredients are listed. Too many non-active or synthetic ingredients make it much harder for the body to digest and, adds Jordan, can cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “You could think that you’re safeguarding your health or being proactive, which comes from a really good place, but then choose supplements that might not be right for you on a personal level or up to scratch. That could have a real impact on other aspects of your health, particularly your &lt;a href="/topic/gut-health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, because the supplements contain all these buffers and preservatives that aren’t really essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut lining is super-sensitive. It’s the barrier between our outside world and our body, essentially, and these things can have a compounding irritating effect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the label, look out for “synthetics versus natural food form”, recommends Vaughan. “Most people assume that vitamins and minerals are natural. In fact, one survey found that 70 per cent of people think that vitamins and minerals in fortified foods are natural, but they’re not – they’re synthetic. Similarly in the supplement world, there’s a huge knowledge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can’t ‘out supplement’ a bad diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m allergic to the wellness industry wheel,” Jordan jokes. “Most of the ads we all see online – things like green powders, for example – should be under investigation, in my opinion. Many of them create pain points for people and then target them for vulnerability: weight loss, infertility … Solve your PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] with an expensive green powder. It’s really dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cztisH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-256742"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it can mean that we end up feeling more comfortable paying less attention to what we’re actually eating. “Nothing can supplement a bad lifestyle,” Jordan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan agrees. “Based on dietary data, around 75 per cent of people in the UK are not eating enough oily fish,” she says. Generally, our diets have changed exponentially in the last few decades – and Vaughan knows the impact from her own health struggles with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. “I forced myself to eat liver, which is full of nutrients, when I went through my own health struggles,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, especially in poorer communities, we used to eat much more offal and cheap oily fish such as kippers. It goes without saying that we should also be focusing on eating lots of rich, leafy greens and moving our bodies enough, which all helps with our gut health and would alleviate the need for so many supplements in the first place. That baseline, both Vaughan and Jordan agree, must be heeded before we start trying to compensate over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you take just one supplement, this should be it &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a close call here: for Jordan, vitamin D, omega 3 and magnesium all chart high; for Vaughan, omega 3 just about tips it with vitamin D a close second. In fact, the government recommends we should all take a supplement for vitamin D, as thanks to the lack of sunlight in the UK, which stimulates the production of it in our bodies naturally, most of us are deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in winter and autumn months,” says Jordan. “Just having that can really help your energy, help your mood, help your gut as well, and your immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cDKnxE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-256743"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even when we are eating enough oily fish, which is packed with omega 3, Vaughan notes that recent years have seen fluctuations in the amount of nutrients we’re getting from fish like salmon and mackerel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s some evidence that omega 3 levels in oily fish have been declining over the last 50 years,” she explains. So there’s a combination of, not only are we not eating enough, but the amount that you used to have to eat to get enough omega 3 is now no longer enough either, so it exacerbates it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega 3s are so important for us at the cellular level – every single cell membrane needs omega 3s to kind of work their membranes to work flexibly, to let nutrients in, let waste out. They’re also good for hormone balance, brain function. It’s incredibly necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan agrees, adding that it’s especially important in pregnancy and postpartum. “A particular DHA, a specific type of omega 3, is given to the baby, not mum in that time. So women who have experienced brain fog after giving birth, for example, might benefit from supplementing with omega 3 to get those levels back up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOYmM4czQ4WG81UVItQzhQa2JFakcyT2JNVTdBNmJaQ1gwZnVPVFRTZnVwa2JyVWJ3Wm9iOEFHVHNRRmw2X2ZJdnZJVzJPamhFUUprWWZhd1ZZSV9fU3JkTHdKaEUtcFFZWkRoeWI5T0tfbG03b1k1Vk1KVTIza0JRbER5T0JkaVZlLUlHRGtuSE5PdlN3cWlZeDFMUFo</guid></item><item><title>罕见的食肉感染使蒙哥马利县的企业主留在医院-费城6abc</title><link>https://6abc.com/post/rare-flesh-eating-infection-leaves-montgomery-county-business-owner-hospital/18340382/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (WPVI) -- &lt;/span&gt;A Montgomery County business owner is continuing to recover in the hospital after being diagnosed with a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection, a medical emergency that has kept him hospitalized since mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Peter Atkinson, 49, of North Wales, has been at Doylestown Hospital since Dec. 19 after doctors diagnosed him with necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson said the hospital's swift response saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If it wasn't for the help of this hospital, I would definitely be dead," Atkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson said his illness initially felt like the flu. He described spiking a 104-degree fever and noticing a mass in his chest area before seeking medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"How did I get this? How did this happen? Apparently, it's rare, but it's not that rare because it happened to me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He said doctors quickly realized the severity of his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I showed them, and it was like, wow, not even five minutes later, he came and said, 'We have to do emergency surgery. We're going to intubate you,'" Atkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The infection later progressed to sepsis, and his kidneys began to fail, according to his family. His sister, Marietta Atkinson, said the experience has been especially painful given their family's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Probably one of the most traumatic events in our life, second traumatic event. In 2016, we lost our sister to sepsis, very similar to what Pete had," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Family members said Atkinson began to show signs of improvement on Christmas. His wife, Sherri Paulson-Atkinson, described the emotional toll of seeing her husband hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My husband is a fighter, he's a go-getter, he is always busy, and to see him laying there like that was really hard for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson owns a towing company and is unable to work for the foreseeable future.

Purge the fridge, the freezer, and the pantry. Make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/16-year-old-up-girl-death-cause-junk-food-pizza-pasta-burger-neurologist-reacts-to-claims-real-cause-reveals-truth-maggi-101766657776901.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="junk food"&gt;junk food&lt;/a&gt; inconvenient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meal prep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The heart surgeon advises preparing meals in advance - before you get hungry - so that nutritious options are always within easy reach, reducing impulsive food choices and making it far easier to stick to healthier eating habits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “Meal prep before you get hungry. Meal preparation makes healthy choices more convenient rather than using convenience to justify unhealthy choices.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reward yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rewarding yourself for small wins can build motivation and encourage you to keep making healthy choices. Dr London stresses, “Acknowledge when you follow through on the promises you make and reward yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share your wins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist explains that sharing even small wins with your loved ones can make the journey more enjoyable while also creating a sense of accountability that helps you stay committed to your goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He highlights, “Win with others. Not only is it more fun to share small wins with otherst, but it can help hold you accountable. Focus on progression over perfection. The goal isn't to jump on a short-term diet, but to build a sustainable nutritional plan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;Banner Health on Thursday is initiating mandatory masking at all facilities across the six-state healthcare system due to a significant surge in seasonal influenza to protect patients, visitors and staff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Masking will be required for patients, visitors and staff in all Banner locations where patients are present until further notice. Patients admitted to Banner hospitals are not required to mask in their hospital rooms. Masking will be encouraged in non-patient areas as well. Masks will be available at all public entrances to Banner facilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This measure is necessary because older patients and those with immunodeficiencies are at heightened risk and these extra precautions will help safeguard our most vulnerable populations,” said Marjorie Bessel, MD, Banner Health chief clinical officer. “Our top priority is to protect our patients, staff, and the communities we serve by reducing the spread of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new subvariant of influenza A, H3N2, is leading to higher infection rates although the seasonal vaccination remains highly effective against severe disease and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flu kills tens of thousands of people each year,” Dr. Bessel said. “Our masking plan will help us protect everyone, especially high-risk groups including those 65 and older, children 2 and under, pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A reminder of other best practices to help stem the spread of communicable disease, including the flu:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;· Wearing a mask in crowded areas, such as airports, on public transportation or at indoor events&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;· Handwash or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer frequently&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay home if you’re feeling ill&lt;br&gt;· Stay current on recommended vaccines, including the flu vaccine&lt;/p&gt;

Kim, who shares faith-based content with more than 300,000 followers &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS-hIiekZBe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, said his son Micah died on New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an emotional video posted Thursday, Kim thanked supporters &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;for their prayers&lt;/a&gt; and asked for privacy as his family grieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are so proud of him," Kim said in the video. "I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, as his dad, on behalf of my family, for all the ways you guys &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prayed and lifted us up&lt;/a&gt; during this time.

Kim later told followers that Micah had been placed on life support and urged people to pray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later updates, he revealed that the flu infection had turned septic and triggered seizures. At the time, Kim said doctors described the case as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/rare-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rare and serious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Dec. 30 update, Kim said his son’s condition had worsened and that Micah was in a coma as doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt; worked to give him as much time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/record-breaking-flu-numbers-reported-new-york-state-sparking-warnings-from-officials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECORD-BREAKING FLU NUMBERS REPORTED IN NEW YORK STATE, SPARKING WARNINGS FROM OFFICIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to recent data, the CDC reported 288 pediatric flu deaths in the recent 2024-25 season.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kim’s posts&lt;/a&gt;, some of which showed Micah in the hospital, were viewed millions of times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the ordeal, Kim referred to his son as a fighter and "my hero."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written Instagram post, he quoted Job 1:21, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord" and said Micah had entered "the never-ending glory, love, and peace of God." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that while his family’s hearts are broken, they continue to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rely on their faith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim also asked followers to pray for his family as they learn "how to live by faith and not by sight." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/celebrity-trainer-says-tennessee-community-saved-his-5-year-old-daughter-during-cancer-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CELEBRITY TRAINER SAYS TENNESSEE COMMUNITY SAVED HIS 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DURING CANCER BATTLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kim first shared news of his son's illness Dec. 21. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent data, the CDC reported 288 pediatric deaths in the 2024-25 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been a record high for a non-pandemic year, mostly among unvaccinated kids, with 70% having underlying conditions like asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a new so-called "super flu" strain has emerged this season, a mutation of influenza A H3N2 called subclade K.

A commercial ran that appeared to promote that obesity is a perfectly healthy lifestyle and, if you think otherwise, you're fat-shaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more bizarre is that the commercial was created by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), a company that produces several drugs targeted toward obese people, including Zepbound, a drug you've likely seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZAjEkVpANI"&gt;promoted in other advertisements&lt;/a&gt;. Lilly also makes Mounjaro, a drug to help treat type 2 diabetes. That's another drug you've likely seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuZbEGk6yZc"&gt;hundreds of TV advertisements promoting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-image component-center"&gt;&lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;During the College Football Playoff at the Rose Bowl, Eli Lilly aired a halftime commercial that many viewers read as endorsing obesity as healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sub-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad featured a young man, who we're supposed to think is an athlete, speaking at what appears to be a press conference. The young man essentially attacks internet fat-shaming and says his life choices are no one's business but his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been dieting since I was 12. You think I need to hear about your workout routine? You don't stop to ask about mine," the man says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, to be fair, very few people would likely be interested in the workout routine of someone who looks like him. But I digress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I do, you're gonna have your own thoughts, so get it all out while you're in the comment section. I'll be focusing on what really matters, like how I feel when I'm waking up in the morning, like showing up for people I love. My health is my focus, and my body is nobody's business," he concludes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There Are So Many Problems With This Commercial &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, the ad was made by Lilly. Lilly running a commercial that says obesity is healthy is like McDonald's running an ad that says eating Big Macs will make you rich. Neither is true, but it certainly behooves the company to tell you that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is that McDonald's isn't actually running a commercial that says eating Big Macs will make you rich because that's ridiculous. But Lilly is running multiple commercials &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=401057382526530"&gt;saying that obesity is healthy&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it actually is the business of other Americans if their fellow citizens are obese, because we pay billions of dollars in taxes and a lot of that money &lt;a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-much-does-federal-government-spend-health-care"&gt;goes into government-funded health care&lt;/a&gt;. Obese people put more strain on the health care system than non-obese people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obese people, on average, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2640491/"&gt;spend more time in hospitals&lt;/a&gt; according to studies. So, the more obese people there are in the country, the less space there is available for other people seeking treatment from doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't the only person to notice the obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not fat-shaming to tell someone they are overweight and should try to lose weight; in fact, it's quite the opposite. It shows that you care about their health. No matter &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/dove-soap-brand-slams-oscar-winning-film-whale-using-fat-suit-want-better-representation"&gt;how much money companies spend&lt;/a&gt; trying to pretend like being fat is simply a lifestyle choice akin to what clothes you choose to wear, it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jrs-highly-anticipated-maha-report-paints-dismal-state-child-health-national-security-concerns"&gt;Obesity isn't healthy&lt;/a&gt;. Telling someone to eat right and exercise isn't fat-shaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly knows that, but here's the part they also know: if everyone in America simply ate healthier and exercised more, they'd make a lot less money. That's why they &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/financial-information/annual-reports"&gt;pour millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; into these types of advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They know that's a drop in the bucket compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.carsongroup.com/insights/blog/getting-big-by-selling-slim-eli-lillys-rise-to-1-trillion/"&gt;billions in profits&lt;/a&gt; from their weight-loss and diabetes drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OutKick</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 01:17:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxORGtUYVA0VVZtZ09sTjYwVWdQMDlNcm1WUWVPWk9SZ0NDQl9pMG1SVFo3OTRmOGpZZS14bnhaX3VPZU1CdGZsN3hld1R1ckZOR1VTVFROSGRkTkJhZHB5X05YMWhpWGRHaG5LdFhxWmNiWUVLX2tHQ2hOWnVIbzZReURlUHRWdw</guid></item><item><title>英国各地开始为NHS儿童接种水痘疫苗- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgexe201n81o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Chickenpox vaccines for young children start across UK&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Philippa Roxby and Smitha Mundasad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;Health reporters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A young toddler looks up at a doctor who is holding a vaccine while rubbing a piece of cotton wool on his arm.

The main feature is an itchy, spotty rash which blisters then scabs over. It can be painful, and cover the body from head to toe. Children often feel unwell for several days, with a fever and muscle aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also spreads easily. Some 90% of children under the age of 10 catch chickenpox at some point, and a week off school or nursery is fairly common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But it can develop into something more severe, warns Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"For some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Complications can include bacterial infection of scabs, and much more rarely, a swelling of the brain known as encephalitis, lung inflammation known as pnemonitis, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Young babies and adults are more likely to be seriously ill with the infection.

There were concerns over the costs of a UK-wide vaccination programme and a potential rise in cases of shingles - when the chickenpox virus is reactivated in adulthood - but that has not been found to be an issue after many years of vaccination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Recent research also shows the scale of the impact of chickenpox on children and the NHS. An estimated £24 million in income and productivity is lost every year in the UK due to chickenpox in childhood, NHS England says. It also calculates that the vaccine rollout could save £15 million a year in NHS treatment costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For all those reasons, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the vaccine on the NHS in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Families will save both time and money - no longer facing lost income from taking time off work or having to fork out for private vaccinations," Streeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was "welcome news" that a vaccine was being rolled out across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile the Royal College of GPs said all NHS childhood vaccines were safe and effective, adding that jabs were "some of the most important health interventions parents can make for their children".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Who can get a chickenpox vaccine, and when?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Close-up of a spot-covered chest of a young boy with chickenpox - the spots are red and blistered, covering his torso, neck and chin" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Protection against chickenpox is offered in a new, combined vaccine called MMRV, which will replace the current MMR jab.

&lt;p&gt;CASPER, Wyo. — Mandatory masking is returning to Banner Wyoming Medical Center in Casper as flu season continues and the number of cases rises. While the hospital did not say specifically when the mandate would be lifted, other seasonal visitor restrictions will be lifted March 31.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All visitors, patients and medical staff are now required to mask in all patient areas of the hospital, though visitors are still encouraged to wear masks in non-patient areas as well. Patients, meanwhile, are not required to wear masks in their own hospital room.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masks will be available to visitors for free at all entrances to the campus.






&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banner also requires the following during this illness-filled time of year:





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No visitors under the age of 13. Children must be supervised by an adult at all times when in the facility’s public waiting areas and cafeterias. Siblings of newborn babies are permitted to visit after being screened.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Those with fever, cough, vomiting and diarrhea should not visit the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wash or sanitize hands often while at the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These steps are in place to protect our patients, visitors and team members while we continue providing high-quality care,” Banner Health said of its seasonal visitor restrictions.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on Banner Health’s seasonal visitor policies, see its website &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/patients/patient-resources/visitor-restrictions?fbclid=IwY2xjawPD3gBleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnRjBmFwcF9pZBAyMjIwMzkxNzg4MjAwODkyAAEewzjripcrKh0DAh0IqW9TagnomteT-2hIXP9VP6ILYlZCjsXkuijRpYp8NaE_aem_q2-PwjviJ6vf_lrlx0RM6g"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

DHHS also noted that 40 Utahns have been diagnosed with measles over &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51416341/utah-has-a-115-confirmed-cases-of-measles-with-latest-infection-at-bingham-high" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;the past three weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Utah Health District leads the state's case count with 114 confirmed infections, followed by the &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51422706/6-new-measles-cases-reported-in-utah-county" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah County Health District&lt;/a&gt; with 16, and the Wasatch County Health District, which has a total of 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's rise in measles cases is just a glimpse of the virus's impact across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, the Utah-Arizona border, as well as the upstate region of South Carolina, which have all seen ongoing outbreaks of the virus have continuously added to the dozens of reported cases each week, &lt;a href="https://corecms.ksl.com/tools/cms/article/51425709" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, there have been 2,065 confirmed measles cases reported in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;. A higher annual total of infections than the country had seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah-Arizona border accounts for more than 350 cases reported between the two states alone in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 2,065 measles cases across the U.S., 11% of those have resulted in hospitalizations; with three confirmed deaths due to the illness, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the country had 2,000 cases of measles reported in one year was in 1992, which was a couple of years after health leaders updated recommendations to say that children should get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine instead of just one, CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past quarter-century, measles has been considered eliminated in the United States. Since 2000, no outbreaks or other chains of transmission have lasted longer than a year. But now multiple large outbreaks in 2025 may be connected, which puts the elimination status at risk, if cases continue to grow through late January, according to CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC,  measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, but the MMR vaccine offers effective protection. Health officials state that one dose of the vaccine is 93% effective against measles infection and a second dose provides 97% protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the CDC said vaccination rates have been on the decline for several years, especially among young children. During the 2024-25 school year, only 92.5% of incoming kindergarten students have received the MMR vaccine, which is below the 95% threshold, health officials say, is necessary to alleviate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 156 individuals in Utah who contracted measles in 2025, the DHHS said 140 of those were not vaccinated. Nine of those were vaccinated and seven patients' vaccination status was unknown, &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;according to the department's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;
