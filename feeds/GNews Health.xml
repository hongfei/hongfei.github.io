After a Legionnaires' outbreak that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5652421/#:~:text=During%20the%20summer%20of%202015,tower%20in%20the%20South%20Bronx." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sickened 138 people and killed 16&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city law&lt;/a&gt; requires building owners to test for Legionella bacteria every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d223h"&gt;In 2017, the first year of inspections, the agency inspected 5,200 cooling towers and issued over 48,000 violations to building owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt9t6"&gt;This year, the department is on track to complete less than half that number of inspections – just 1,167 as of June, according to data provided by the health department. It’s a record low, not counting 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic disrupted city services. And the number of violations this year is set to hit an all-time low. As of April, the department only issued 269.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5v2q3"&gt;The data also shows year after year of declining enforcement. After rebounding to 4,400 inspections in 2022, the agency has conducted between 22% and 30% fewer inspections and issued fewer violations each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dhuqh"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the decrease in inspections was due to a lack of inspectors at the agency. She did not respond to questions about the severity of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a7q6o"&gt;The current outbreak that started in late July has sickened 73 people, three of them fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="50ov4"&gt;The 2017 laws require building owners to register cooling towers and inspect for Legionella bacteria. The law, however, does not indicate how often the city must carry out its own inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6agon"&gt;Cooling tower inspections, according to city experts, are a critical defense against outbreaks of the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8qu05"&gt;Acting Health Commissioner Michelle Morse told WNYC on Wednesday that the ability to inspect cooling towers after the outbreak helped the city stop the disease's spread in Harlem. However, she did not elaborate on whether more regular inspections could have prevented the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d6ai0"&gt;“From my perspective, there is of course always more that we can do to advance our prevention efforts, and this is why investing in public health is so important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6iafe"&gt;A review of cooling tower registration and inspection data shows that about 1,900 of the 4,928 registered towers in the city have not been inspected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since 2023 and 85 have no record of inspection by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cjkk2"&gt;Those towers cool apartments and other large buildings by circulating water through air conditioning systems. The water returns to the cooling tower warm and is evaporated as vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="55aas"&gt;Without proper inspection and treatment, that warm water can become a hotbed for deadly Legionella bacteria. Inhaling infected vapor can lead to Legionnaires’ disease, which causes cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 22:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNOXZZU2taekFwaEtuQkZCZ2d1SDZJWHFoLXdFNFI4eHA2am9kOHlBbVRtQXZkWFdWbkhIOWVmODd4cTNZNU4xVHJUcE5TWHVoTVYtYUlRRmZ3akxEdjJ5RFJicjFURzVpNFZkMmNnb29tTEhOMUttaXc5RnlpVkFKb1lJcVlyclZqQkdETzRpVmJRaUxZckFnaXRFR1EzUQ</guid></item><item><title>使用ChatGPT后，男性将盐换成溴化钠并患上精神病- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNU3lPeVJYOXNVMjRSM2d3cmE4NWNrckdMOWlIdzA0MDJHeUE1NzR6SFRqa3hyWlVUY2xJMXVkX1V2dWE3eU1IaFpaY2pVbjBRSS1YVW9pZjVaQjd0a1dVckhCR240aHRETzB5RG0xejBQWUFTM1ROcWd5MU1kVDI1bW0xdGxnN3BHNUJ1RWFTRTFXYkFCMm5XVXRUMHRFZW9zNXZrczVDbGx1dVMzQWc1eC02ZXFDVmk5MmFJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Bromide sedatives vanished from the US market by 1989, after the Food and Drug Administration banned them, and "bromism" as a syndrome is today unfamiliar to many Americans. (Though you can still get it by &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563659709001219"&gt;drinking, as one poor guy did, two to four liters of cola daily [!],&lt;/a&gt; if that cola contains "brominated vegetable oil." Fortunately, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-revokes-regulation-allowing-use-brominated-vegetable-oil-bvo-food"&gt;removed brominated vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt; from US food products in 2024.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, over the man's first day at the hospital, he grew worse and showed "increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations." He then attempted to escape the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the escape attempt, the man was given an involuntary psychiatric hold and an anti-psychosis drug. He was administered large amounts of fluids and electrolytes, as the best way to beat bromism is "aggressive saline diuresis"—that is, to load someone up with liquids and let them pee out all the bromide in their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took time, as the man's bromide level was eventually measured at a whopping 1,700 mg/L, while the "reference range" for healthy people is 0.9 to 7.3 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the man suffered from a terrifying psychosis and was kept in the hospital for &lt;em&gt;three full weeks&lt;/em&gt; over an entirely preventable condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all began&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during his stay, once doctors had his psychosis under control, that the man began telling them how it all began. He had read about the problems with too much table salt, which led him to rid his diet of sodium chloride, which led him to ChatGPT, which led him to believe that he could use sodium bromide instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors who &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;wrote up this case study for Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases&lt;/a&gt; note that they never got access to the man's actual ChatGPT logs. He likely used ChatGPT 3.5 or 4.0, they say, but it's not clear that the man was actually told by the chatbot to do what he did. Bromide salts &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be substituted for table salt—just not in the human body. They are used in various cleaning products and pool treatments, however.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A greasy takeaway may seem like an innocent Friday night indulgence. But our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3050624725000051"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; suggests even a single high-fat meal could impair blood flow to the brain, potentially increasing the risk of stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fat is an important part of our diet. It provides us with a concentrated source of energy, transports  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="170438" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and when stored in the body, protects our organs and helps keep us warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two main types of fat that we consume are saturated and unsaturated (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated), which are differentiated by their chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;Eating a High-Fat Diet May Increase Your Anxiety, Study Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these fats have different effects on our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it is well established that eating a meal that is high in saturated fat, such as that self-indulgent Friday night takeaway pizza, can be bad for our blood vessels and heart health. And these effects are not simply confined to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain has limited energy stores, which means it is heavily reliant on a continuous supply of blood delivering oxygen and glucose to maintain normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the body maintains this supply is through a process known as &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X241235878"&gt;"dynamic cerebral autoregulation"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process ensures that blood flow to the brain remains stable despite everyday changes in blood pressure, such as standing up and exercising. It's like having shock absorbers that help keep our brains cool under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when this process is impaired, those swings in blood pressure become harder to manage. That can mean brief episodes of too little or too much blood reaching the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this increases the risk of developing conditions like stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What role might diet play?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a meal high in saturated fat, levels of fat in the blood rise and peak after around four hours. At the same time, blood vessels become stiffer and lose their ability to relax and expand. This restricts blood flow around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But little is known about what happens to the brain during this time and how well its blood supply is protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this for the first time, we recruited 20 young men between the ages of 18 and 35, and 21 men between 60 and 80. We measured how well blood vessels linked to heart and brain health worked before, and four hours following, consumption of a meal high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed how well a blood vessel in the arm could open up in response to increased blood flow to obtain an indication of heart health. This is a method known as &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00471.2010"&gt;"flow-mediated dilatation"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate how well blood vessels in the brain could cope with swings in blood pressure, our participants performed body-weight squats. We used ultrasound to determine how well blood flowed through vessels during both methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test meal was a milkshake, which we called "the brain bomb" because it consisted mostly of heavy whipping cream. The drink contained 1,362 calories and 130g of fat, mimicking the fat load of a fast-food takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants. These impairments reduced the brain's ability to buffer changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we didn't directly test for the long-term effects of a high-fat meal on mental functioning in this study, &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;we have previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that such a meal increases free radicals (unstable, cell-damaging molecules) and decreases nitric oxide (molecules that help blood vessels relax and open up to transport oxygen and glucose around the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain the reduced blood flow regulation we observed in our recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170513" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515.png" alt="Diagram showing how fat can stiffen arteries" class="wp-image-170513 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515.png 1920w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-642x416.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-640x415.png 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-768x498.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-1536x996.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-600x389.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stiff arteries and a sluggish brain. (Chris Marley/Damian Bailey)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has important clinical implications. While an occasional takeaway is unlikely to cause harm on its own, our results suggest that even one fatty meal has an immediate effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study highlights the importance of consuming a diet that is low in saturated fat to protect not only our heart health, but also our brain health. This is particularly important for older adults whose brains appear to be more vulnerable to the effects of such a meal and are already at increased risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;NHS recommendeds&lt;/a&gt; that men consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while women should consume no more than 20g. Yet many of us routinely exceed that, particularly during weekend takeaways, pub lunches or fast-food splurges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, we may spend much of our waking lives in a post-meal state. This period, known as &lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0568-5"&gt;"post-prandial lipaemia"&lt;/a&gt;, is when fat levels are elevated, and when the body, it seems, may be most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still so much more we need to learn about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends swapping saturated fats for polyunsaturated ones. These are found in foods like oily fish, walnuts and seeds, which are associated with better heart and brain health over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we don't yet know how the brain responds to a single meal that is high in polyunsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor do we know how the female brain responds to a high-fat meal. This is a crucial gap in our knowledge since women face a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00249-8/fulltext"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; in later life compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers a timely reminder that diet doesn't just shape our long-term health. It also affects our body and brain in real time. And as we're learning, when it comes to protecting brain health, every meal may count.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259961/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Three to five days after those symptoms, a characteristic rash appears,” said Rachel Mugleston, RN, Health Strategies Program Manager at Eastern Idaho Public Health. “Measles is highly contagious and can be spread for four days before and four days after the rash appears.”   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EIPH also reminds residents that although measles is considered a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age. “Eastern Idaho Public Health encourages everyone to check their vaccination records with their primary care provider,” officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The best way to protect you and your family from infection is through up-to-date vaccination for measles/mumps/rubella (MMR),” Thursday’s statement reported. “The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after receiving two doses.”  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, if you believe you may have been exposed to anyone with measles, contact your health care provider and monitor yourself for symptoms for 21 days after exposure, according to EIPH. Public health officials will observe those known to have been exposed to the infected individual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;ORIGINAL STORY&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;IDAHO FALLS – A case of measles in an “adolescent” has been reported locally by Eastern Idaho Public Health, according to a statement released Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials stated the “adolescent was an international traveler who was unvaccinated against measles.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EIPH is investigating the case, according to health officials there, who said the child was seen by a “healthcare provider for symptoms of measles and was not hospitalized.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thursday’s statement reported the child had “self-isolated during the contagious period” and was no longer contagious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“EIPH does not expect exposure to the public, outside of household contacts who are currently being monitored for potential infection,” health officials stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a serious, highly contagious disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measles virus can easily spread through the air and can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected individual has left, according to EIPH officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated people in the United States who have measles is hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who have received the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine, have had measles in the past, or were born before 1957 are considered immune to the measles virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/08/measles-detected-in-wastewater-in-coeur-dalene-but-no-idaho-cases-reported-amid-national-outbreak/"&gt;Measles detected in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene.

Despite their name, though, they belong to an entirely different family of fungi, the Gyromitra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels contain compounds called hydrazines that are toxic to the nervous system. While eating one may cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, in severe cases, a false morel can cause seizures and multi-organ failure. Gyromitrin, the main toxin in the mushroom, is also a carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists believe they've found a link between false morels and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14606543/footage-impact-motor-neurone-disease-healthy-woman.html"&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) in Montchavin, as a mysterious cluster of cases has developed over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and, in some parts of the world, motor neurone disease, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that progressively paralyzes patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montchavin has a permanent population of about 200 people, and the average global diagnosis rate of ALS is two to three diagnoses per 100,000 people annually. Yet in the last decade, there have been 16 cases reported in Montchavin, far more than what would be expected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Over a period of about 10 years, 16 residents of a ski village in the French Alps, out of a population of 200, had ALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If made comparable to a rate in 100,000 people per year, Montchavin's rate would be 800 cases per 100,000 residents per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The search for answers was led by Dr Emmeline Lagrange, a neurologist practicing at Grenoble University Hospital, 84 miles southwest of the village. A resident of Montchavin who had been experiencing neurological issues had been referred to Lagrange, who diagnosed them with ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would later learn on a call with the patient’s referring physician in Montchavin that this was one of several ALS cases in the small mountain village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the patients had a gene mutation making them more susceptible to ALS or a family history of the disease, which causes continuously worsening paralysis over time, leading to death after two to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still investigating the cause of ALS, which affects roughly 33,000 Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics are behind between 10 and 15 percent of cases, while the rest could be tied to environmental exposures, including toxic pollution, smoking, exposure to heavy metals like lead and mercury, and a history of head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lagrange published an abstract summarizing her investigation into the unusual ALS cluster, which caught the eye of environmental neuroscientist Dr Peter Spencer of the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer is the leading proponent of a separate theory linking food to the degenerative disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His theory was that toxins in cycad seeds, once a staple of Guam’s Chamorro people, triggered an epidemic of Western Pacific ALS-Parkinsonism dementia (ALS-PDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At its peak, ALS-PDC was 50 to 100 times more common in Guam than ALS rates worldwide. In the 1950s, incidence rates reached about 200 per 100,000 among Chamorro adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has investigated the link for over four decades, arguing that a compound in cycad seeds called cycasin metabolizes into a neurotoxic DNA-damaging byproduct called methylazoxymethanol (MAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MAM is also formed when the body metabolizes hydrazine, a volatile chemical used in rocket fuels and also found in false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A true morel is a gourmet delicacy, though it must be properly cooked or could be poisonous. True morels are often featured in Michelin-starred restaurants and in high-end cuisine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The false morel [shown] is often reddish-brown, whereas true morels are typically green or gray. False morels are also a different shape and has brain-like folds and ridges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Spencer saw a presentation of Lagrange’s abstract, his mind lingered on one line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/did-eating-false-mushrooms-cause-als-french-village"&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I noted that among the foodstuffs they reported were mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I asked them what type of mushrooms, because one particular type contains poisons associated with the Guam problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They began collaborating on a study. Lagrange had learned that the ALS patients in Montchavin had been purposely seeking out false morels, believing they had rejuvenating properties, despite their illegal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A villager told Lagrange: ‘They are always in a group, a secret group, a social network, and they eat the mushrooms. And they all knew that it’s forbidden.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers included those patients in their study, as well as 48 villagers without the disease who ate wild mushrooms, but not false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some ALS patients had a history of collecting up to six pounds of the poisonous fungi during the spring and summer and eating them throughout the year. People who had been diagnosed with ALS had been eating the mushrooms for as long as 20 years before ALS symptoms arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All ALS cases but none of the controls had a history of consuming acutely poisonous False Morels, notably the Snow Morel Gyromitra gigas,’ Lagrange &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(21)00252-5/fulltext"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Neuroscientist Emmeline Lagrange spearheaded the investigation into the ALS cluster in the French Alps, determining from a lengthy investigation that ALS patients shared something in common: their love for false morels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Since no other significant chemical or physical exposure was found, the primary risk factor for ALS in this community appears to be repeated ingestion of these neurotoxic fungi.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the false morel’s toxicity, it is a delicacy in parts of Scandinavia, where Michelin-starred restaurants incorporate it on seasonal menus for its tang and nuttiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Finns are such big fans that the species was featured on a 1974 postage stamp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels are also endorsed by the Finnish Food Authority, which advises people to repeatedly boil and rinse fresh or dried specimens before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their differences in appearance, amateur foragers often confuse true morels with false ones, which resemble a reddish brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A June 2024 Toxicon study identified &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010124003970?via%3Dihub"&gt;118 false morel poisonings&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan between 2002 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, while over a dozen developed liver damage.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers studied brain tissue of about 400 people post mortem, as well as blood samples and a battery of memory tests performed yearly before their death. The scientists found higher levels of lithium in cognitively healthy people. But as sticky clumps of protein, known as amyloid plaques, began forming in their brains in the early stages of dementia, the amyloid trapped the lithium, restraining it and reducing its availability to surrounding brain cells. That depleted the lithium even in parts of the brain that were amyloid-free, essentially reducing lithium’s protective function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers also fed healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet, spurring memory problems: they had trouble performing several laboratory memory tests. And finally, the researchers were also able to reverse disease-related damage and restore memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease, by returning lithium to their diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_kind_of_lithium_was_used_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

They used &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11954165/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11954165/"&gt;lithium orotate,&lt;/a&gt; which is a compound that is able to evade the sticky amyloid plaques in our brains. The type of lithium used to treat psychiatric disorders is lithium carbonate, but it can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537577/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537577/"&gt;hard on people’s kidneys&lt;/a&gt; and toxic to elderly patients. The amount of lithium orotate used by the Harvard team was one-thousandth the level, essentially mimicking the amount naturally found in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="should_you_buy_lithium_online_or_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

So there’s no way to tell whether the substance actually contains lithium and, if so, in what amounts, or whether it contains contaminants. Generally, a firm does not have to provide the FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety before or after it markets its products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="how_else_should_i_get_lithium_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

&lt;p&gt;Chopping onions is a fundamental cooking skill that many home chefs dread due to the inevitable tears that follow. Recent scientific research from Cornell University has finally provided a definitive answer to this culinary conundrum. Their findings reveal that the key to tear-free onion cutting lies in two simple factors: using a sharp knife and cutting slowly. This breakthrough could transform how we approach this essential kitchen task and make meal preparation more enjoyable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The science behind onion tears&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you slice into an onion, you’re breaking open cells that contain enzymes and sulfur compounds. These components mix together and create syn-propanethial-S-oxide, a volatile gas that rises through the air and irritates the sensitive membranes in your eyes. Your eyes respond to this irritation by producing tears to wash away the irritant.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Cornell University conducted detailed experiments to understand exactly how this irritating compound gets released during cutting. Using a specially designed guillotine fitted with different blades, they meticulously documented the spray patterns produced when cutting onions under various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research team captured high-speed footage&lt;/strong&gt; of onion juice ejection during cutting, allowing them to analyze precisely how much spray was produced and what factors influenced it. This methodical approach finally provided scientific validation for what many chefs have long suspected about knife sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between our dietary choices and bodily functions extends beyond cooking techniques. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-brain-can-change-intestinal-bacteria-in-a-couple-of-hours/"&gt;the brain can change intestinal bacteria in a couple of hours&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting how interconnected our body systems truly are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sharp knives create fewer tears&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cornell study conclusively demonstrated that knife sharpness plays a crucial role in determining how much onion spray is produced during cutting. &lt;em&gt;Dull blades significantly increase both the speed and number of ejected droplets&lt;/em&gt; that carry the tear-inducing compound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using a blunt knife, the researchers observed that the blade tends to push down on the onion’s layers before actually cutting through them. This compression forces the layers to bend inward, storing elastic energy. As the cut progresses, these compressed layers spring back, forcefully ejecting juice into the air – and ultimately into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, sharp blades slice cleanly through the onion’s cellular structure with minimal compression. This precision cutting reduces the amount of juice that gets sprayed into the surrounding air, resulting in fewer tears for the person doing the chopping.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy lifestyle includes not just proper cooking techniques but also regular exercise. Studies show that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/take-10000-steps-a-day-if-you-can-well-but-already-7000-they-keep-in-health/"&gt;taking 7,000 steps daily can significantly improve health&lt;/a&gt;, making it an achievable goal for most people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cutting speed matters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second critical factor identified by the Cornell researchers was cutting speed. Contrary to what many might assume, &lt;strong&gt;faster cutting actually produces more tears&lt;/strong&gt;, not fewer. The research team found that rapid cutting motions generated more juice and created a finer mist of the irritating compound that more easily reaches the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slowing down your cutting motion allows for more control and precision, which results in less spray. This measured approach might take a few extra seconds, but the comfort gained is well worth the minimal additional time investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the key techniques to implement for tear-free onion cutting:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a professionally sharpened chef’s knife&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cut with deliberate, slow movements&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Minimize compression of the onion layers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintain proper ventilation in your kitchen&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider chilling the onion briefly before cutting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding how we interact with food extends beyond cooking techniques. Research indicates that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/there-is-a-lost-memory-of-the-meals-that-makes-us-eat-more-than-necessary/"&gt;there is a lost memory of meals that makes us eat more than necessary&lt;/a&gt;, showing how our relationship with food is influenced by psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our early development can also affect our overall health trajectory. Studies have found that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/growth-in-the-first-1000-days-of-life-affects-adult-stature/"&gt;growth in the first 1,000 days of life affects adult stature&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the importance of proper nutrition from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Additional benefits beyond comfort&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cornell researchers noted that adopting these proper cutting techniques offers benefits beyond just preventing tears. &lt;em&gt;Minimizing airborne spray during food preparation can reduce the spread of potential pathogens in kitchen environments&lt;/em&gt;, contributing to overall food safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important when cutting vegetables with tough outer layers that store significant elastic energy. The proper technique not only improves comfort but also supports better kitchen hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Knife Condition&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cutting Speed&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tear Production&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Airborne Spray&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sharp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Slow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Minimal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sharp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dull&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Slow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dull&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excessive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent medical research has identified interesting connections between medications and mental health, such as &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/a-new-connection-between-the-competitive-drugs-of-the-glp-1-and-the-depression/"&gt;a new connection between GLP-1 drugs and depression&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the complex interplay between different body systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Food waste remains a significant issue in modern society. Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-invisible-food-waste-of-the-canteens-a-chasm-of-costs-and-food-thrown/"&gt;the invisible food waste in canteens creates enormous costs&lt;/a&gt;, making efficient food preparation techniques all the more important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The broader impact of proper technique&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mastering the art of onion cutting not only improves your culinary experience but also contributes to better health outcomes. &lt;strong&gt;Reducing eye irritation makes cooking more enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially encouraging more home-cooked meals. This can lead to healthier eating patterns and greater control over ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The precision skills developed through proper cutting techniques transfer to other aspects of cooking as well. Improving knife skills generally leads to more consistent food preparation, better presentation, and ultimately more satisfying meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity complements good nutrition for overall health. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/exercise-fights-cancer-now-we-understand-how/"&gt;exercise fights cancer through specific biological mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; that scientists are now beginning to understand fully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The humble onion, found in cuisines worldwide from Italian pasta sauces to Indian curries, no longer needs to be a source of kitchen frustration. With the scientifically validated combination of a sharp knife and slow cutting motion, you can incorporate this flavorful vegetable into your cooking without reaching for tissues or resorting to swimming goggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

It was first detected in Southeast Asia in January but didn’t appear in U.S. surveillance reports until May.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization classified XFG as a “variant under monitoring” in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a full picture of COVID-19 activity can be difficult given shifting priorities in federal and state health policy. But several key measures help put together a picture of what’s happening in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;CDC: COVID-19 Cases Likely Growing Again In Minnesota&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of July 29, the CDC estimates a 91.85 percent probability that COVID-19 is growing in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s epidemic trend is officially classified as growing, with a reproductive rate (Rt) of 1.05, meaning each infection is leading to more than one new case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for COVID-19 remain very low, making up just 0.38 percent of total ED visits statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;National Picture&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Projections show infections are growing or likely to grow in 40 states and are unchanged in nine others. The highest rates of transmission are in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC also said COVID viral activity in wastewater remains “low” nationally, though at least 10 states had “high” or “very high” levels as of July 12.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater viral activity is currently low, with 25 sites reporting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although hoarseness appears to be unique to Stratus, other common symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts say the Stratus variant may be better than others at evading immunity. While vaccine guidance is evolving, the CDC still says COVID-19 vaccination helps protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:26:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPVTNwRDRYTW1PNENYMl9SWTNvSm1vYzhVby0wNmtIZXF0ZWlYZm1GSlItY1ZFRl9HTTI5clY5bkVsb3p6cVFRMVZuU3ZHcnBVbkhsWW9NQ1NpN2poSlRScC1nZjR5eDdDNVlZY3JYc2xCVm8yUUFXanRsczc2OE53WHA2Q1JfUlNsYWE4dGxvOWIxNXFiOFlV0gG3AUFVX3lxTE5UbEZVT0I5RWtDc0RoZ3ZCQ0ZpN3YwVUVyUzVZM1EzZk5xZVZ4b2pURW1WVWJYaDE3ak5RWTBkXzE3MXVyY1cyanhOOTNJZGRPTGxwc2xkYWxDV0hnWEZQUF96Sjg0MmJ3UmtqWjhTTUVSbEZQRnM0Z1Z6UjRaQktjOXliQkVJa2NrZUZnbGVwTE94b08zdjNuUEZFVzRMZUt5RGZxbGR0V3lLN2pNb3lfR1Fqd1dlbw</guid></item><item><title>纽约市的退伍军人疾病集群导致3人死亡， 70多人患病。它是什么，您如何获得它？ - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_wFBVV95cUxOdnFTRzQ1MGp0OE1tNnBKRWFBVWlkNUw4cDczYVBwWlhCSW90UFduRE4zR19pbFdJZkNGR29zb0MyN3B1UUdaRGxVWmZWX1hROEtTVV9UMzlfQWFrX05IbUEtazNObXdZNGhaYU1XUXVzVkJVbTgwZ0tWUkhtVDdGM1VNNmVCTjRvSWtPZVZfeE5YbVF0Y19TRThtV2FCODNXV0hFUkwybzhWUFFwUUhfYXBwZ3h3RFV0eS1VX2wwOXNMbU5vZ3dCRDhZTVFrZkU2aXhJUHp2WkswQ1pLVWdzUEhYOV9OWTFqdjlkY0tmMldGcUZaNTVDUGtHSXpWajg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three people have died and over 70 people have been sickened by Legionnaires’ disease amid a cluster discovered in central Harlem in New York City, according to an update from &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health officials Wednesday;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health officials Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disease was initially detected on July 25.

Legionella can grow and spread in human-made water systems like showerheads and sink faucets, hot tubs, decorative fountains, complex and large plumbing systems and cooling towers, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are also factors that make it easier for Legionella to grow and survive in water, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biofilm, which is slime that enables germs to grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Temperatures from 77 degrees to 113 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not having enough disinfectant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Slow or no water movement (&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/prevention/preventing-waterborne-germs-at-home.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read more from the CDC;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read more from the CDC&lt;/a&gt; about how to prevent waterborne germs while away from your home.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-legionnaires-disease"&gt;What are the symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms usually appear in a person within two to 14 days after they’ve been exposed to the bacteria, the CDC says.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were left baffled by a rare condition that saw a 20-year-old woman experience multiple orgasms several times a day, leaving her constantly sexually aroused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Far from being pleasurable, the unnamed woman said the disorder caused her intense distress and interfered with her work and social life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the age of 14 she also suffered with sharp 'electric sensations' in her groin and pelvic contractions resembling orgasms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite multiple treatments, including antidepressants, her symptoms persisted, causing her to believe that her orgasms were being externally manipulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she finally visited a hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-8aaaf240-738c-11f0-a385-f3c2bc710464"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; desperate to get help, her condition had progressed to the point that she could not get through the initial consultation without suffering an episode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neurologists were left clueless after ruling out epilepsy and a host of other neurological disorders through ECG monitoring and other tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On physical examination, the patients also showed no structural abnormalities that could have been affecting her reproductive organs and triggering feelings of arousal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually doctors diagnosed her with persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) after a course of antipsychotic medication - risperidone and later olanzapine - proved promising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Far from being pleasurable, the young woman said her orgasmic episodes completely dismantled her work and social life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a few weeks of treatment, her symptoms began to subside and her delusions improved, enabling her to return to work and resume social commitments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it was observed that when she stopped taking the drugs, her symptoms returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorder is still widely misunderstood and is thought to affect just one per cent of people living in the UK, most of which are women, although experts say the condition is underdiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors remain uncertain what cause the complex condition, but it is thought to result from the misfiring of nerves that connect the brain and the genitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst there is no specific cure, patients can take various medications that work by suppressing nerve signals, in the hope of easing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PGAD symptoms vary widely but commonly include genital pain and discomfort and intense sensations of arousal without sexual desire or stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Possible physical causes include nerve damage, spinal abnormalities and medication side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies also suggest that stress and anxiety may worsen symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors found that her symptoms greatly improved when she started taking anti-psychotic medication, which dampens the dopamine response in the brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other schools of thought claim that the disorder is linked to problems with dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commonly referred to as the happiness hormone, dopamine is a key neurotransmitter involved in the brain's pleasure and reward system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that excess dopamine may amplify sexual arousal, and could theoretically produce orgasmic episodes and other PGAD symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows that the use of dopamine inhibitors such as risperidone and olanzapine may help lessen these abnormal sexual sensations by dampening the dopamine response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors led by Jing Yan and Dafang Ouyang, affiliated with several national mental health institutions in Beijing, say case studies like these play a vital role in medical advances providing evidence for widely misunderstood disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers acknowledge that case studies describe one individual, making it difficult to draw conclusions about cause and effect without taking into consideration confounding factors such as age, sex and medical history.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ahmed Ali has spent the last seven years building something for a South Seattle community he considers his home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside a small storefront a few blocks from the light rail stop, Othello Station Pharmacy has largely flourished as a neighborhood space that provides prescriptions, medical screenings, vaccines and more. It has &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/at-a-time-when-seattle-drugstores-are-closing-an-independent-expands/" class="content-link"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; even as other Seattle drugstores close. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmacy team stayed busy, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/pharmacy-catering-to-a-diverse-south-seattle-neighborhood-is-on-a-mission-to-vaccinate-against-covid-19/" class="content-link"&gt;diving into vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt; and public health partnerships that focused on administering shots and correcting virus misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali thought much of this work would last, that the country would remember how COVID vaccines offered a way out of the pandemic, despite how politically divisive the topic became. But as 2025 progresses, Ali and his staff have watched as federal support wanes and vaccine programs, including his own, start to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really putting our public in jeopardy at this point,” said the 43-year-old pharmacist, worried what outbreaks might be ahead if unvaccinated pockets grow here and nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first seven months of President Donald Trump’s return to office, government support for vaccines has flipped, resulting in &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/how-huge-health-funding-cuts-in-washington-put-lives-at-risk-in-communities/" class="content-link"&gt;widespread funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; and drastic changes in the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/rfk-jr-s-first-month-as-health-secretary-touting-french-fries-and-casting-doubts-on-vaccines/" class="content-link"&gt;public health leadership&lt;/a&gt;, marked by mass firings of top scientists and &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee/" class="content-link"&gt;expert advisers&lt;/a&gt;. The latest blow came this week with the announcement of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/rfk-jr-pulls-500-million-in-funding-for-vaccine-development/" class="content-link"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; to pull $500 million in federal funding to develop mRNA vaccines, an innovation credited for slowing the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though Washington state’s vaccination rates are typically high, vaccine hesitancy has wormed its way into doctors’ offices and pharmacies here, too. &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/data-and-statistical-reports/washington-tracking-network-wtn/school-immunization/dashboard" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;School immunization rates&lt;/a&gt;, one measure of a community’s vaccination, dropped slightly this past academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what’s going to happen now,” Ali said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18731930-790975627" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18731930,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=300x209 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=1024x712 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=768x534 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=1536x1068 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=2048x1424 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=780x542 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=1020x709 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=1560x1085 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=2040x1419 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=375x261 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_1-vax_105324.jpg?d=780x542","caption":"Ramla Abdi, left, with Othello Station Pharmacy, administers a flu shot to Greg McMurtry Jr. during a community health and resource fair at the Northwest African American Museum in April.

She’s worked with Othello Station for about three years, but she doesn’t spend a lot of time at the pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2021, Othello Station has sent a mobile vaccine team to dozens of community health fairs like this, providing shots in schools, homes, long-term care facilities, community centers and other places throughout King County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, its mobile work was made possible through a federal COVID grant to Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, which contracted with Othello Station and Kelley-Ross pharmacies, another local provider, according to public health spokesperson Kate Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although COVID shots were the focus, providers also offered RSV and flu vaccines to people who were homebound, homeless or lived in long-term care, and administered childhood immunizations at schools, according to King County’s public health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pharmacy partnerships were part of the county’s broader efforts to get COVID shots to people who might lack access to vaccines or medical care. Because of federal cuts, these programs ended in June.&lt;/p&gt;

In early July, the CDC told the state it would instead receive $7.8 million in funds that help support affordable vaccines for children, according to DOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson declined to confirm whether the funding changed, but wrote in a statement “some awards differ from those in the previous (funding) cycle” due to “updates to the funding methodology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Washington is exploring other short-term funding to support vital immunization work,” such as through other CDC grants, Jamilia Sherls, director of the state’s Office of Immunization, wrote in an email. If that doesn’t pan out, “it will mean long-term reductions,” Sherls wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losses will likely mean fewer kids can get shots through the state’s Childhood Vaccine Program, funded with federal and state dollars, the health department said. All Washington children under 19, whether or not they have insurance, can receive a vaccine through the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state will also face challenges expanding access to shots, updating data dashboards and offering vaccine education. In July, the state’s &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/care-van-mobile-health-services" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Care-a-Van program&lt;/a&gt; stopped giving COVID, flu and childhood vaccines, though the mobile health clinic still drives around Washington to provide blood pressure and glucose checks, mental health screenings, and naloxone and opioid prevention resources at community and school events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we head into fall, we definitely anticipate there will be renewed demand and new challenges,” said Fardous Guled, a registered nurse at Othello Station who was in charge of scheduling the pharmacy’s mobile vaccine clinics. “We’re just going to be flexible, creative, and try to focus on equity as much as we can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18731944-18731942-1128352710" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18731944,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_9-pharmacy_105538.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Pharmacy assistant Dina Nezareab works on inventory at Othello Station Pharmacy.

We’re starting to see the reemergence of communicable diseases that were once kept at bay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a prime example, she said. The country is battling an ongoing outbreak of the highly infectious disease, with high death counts in Texas and Louisiana. Measles had been considered eradicated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington state this year, there have been &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/measles" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;at least 10 recorded measles cases&lt;/a&gt;, though no outbreaks have been detected to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While feelings around vaccines in a given community can be hard to track, Sherls said she’s seen a growing number of social media posts from parents looking for medical providers in Washington who “are OK with not vaccinating kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those posts have “been keeping me up at night,” she said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18731932-724808388" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18731932,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=1536x1025 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=2048x1366 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=1560x1041 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=2040x1361 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_3-vax_105331.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Ramla Abdi, of Othello Station Pharmacy, prepares a hepatitis B vaccine at a health and resource fair at the Northwest African American Museum.

His team gives about 10 to 12 shots a day, mostly for summer travel purposes, to protect against diseases like malaria, typhoid or yellow fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for respiratory virus and childhood vaccines will likely become more urgent in a few months, when the new school year starts and sick season is around the corner, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and local public health teams are trying to prepare where they can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, some mobile efforts continue in limited capacity, said spokesperson Sharon Bogan. Through the local &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dchs/human-social-services/community-funded-initiatives/best-starts-for-kids" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Best Starts for Kids&lt;/a&gt;, the public health department will still able to host some school vaccine clinics, mainly focusing on South King County districts, Bogan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the topic of vaccines — and vaccine hesitancy — comes up almost daily for many pediatricians and providers at children’s hospitals in the Puget Sound region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our role is around what keeps kids healthy,” said Dr. Shaquita Bell, senior medical director of Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic, a Seattle Children’s hospital clinic. “We’re not out stumping for a candidate or telling you what to put on your ballot. We just want your child to be healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18731943-1574213256" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18731943,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_8-pharmacy_105534.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented Ahmed Ali with the “Immunization Champion Award” in 2022.

			&lt;p&gt;A common type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV) could be more dangerous than we thought. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="169949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as beta-HPV, was thought in rare cases to contribute to skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="169949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by worsening UV damage, but a new study suggests it can actually hijack the body's cells to directly drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fresh conclusions came from a study of a 34-year-old woman who sought medical help for &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma"&gt;cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; (cSCC) on her forehead. Her tumors were repeatedly growing back, even after immunotherapy and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/modified-herpes-virus-found-to-shrink-deadly-skin-cancers-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Modified Herpes Virus Found to Shrink Deadly Skin Cancers in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer genetic analysis revealed something surprising: the beta-HPV had actually integrated itself into the DNA of the woman's tumor, where it was producing viral proteins that helped the cancer thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, beta-HPV had never been found to integrate into cellular DNA, let alone actively maintain a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Andrea Lisco from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman who was the subject of this study had an inherited immune disorder, one which prevented her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; from attacking HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="ZAP70 proteins" class="wp-image-169952 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart-600x349.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues with the ZAP70 protein were key to the research. (Ye et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tests revealed that the woman's immune system could still repair DNA damage from UV radiation – the typical cause of cSCC – the impairment of her T cells meant the beta-HPV could invade her skin cells and trigger the formation of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he immunocompromised woman was also being treated for other HPV-related illnesses, including warts on the skin and in the mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cause of her condition was discovered, the patient received a bone marrow &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt;, to replace her dysfunctional T cells with healthy ones. This cleared up the aggressive skin cancer and her other HPV-caused issues, none of which returned during a three-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by no means minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sunlight-can-still-damage-skin-through-a-closed-window-heres-how"&gt;the role of UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; as a cause of skin cancer, but shows that there are other factors at work too. In rare cases like this, normally benign &lt;span&gt;viruses&lt;/span&gt; can have devastating effects in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That emphasizes the need for targeted, personalized &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; that may well be more effective than conventional and generic approaches. It's likely that the woman involved in this study is far from the only one with this set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason to be hopeful could come from progress against a related disease. Alpha-HPV is known as the cause of many cervical and throat cancers, and widespread vaccination against the virus has resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;drastic drop&lt;/a&gt; in deaths from those cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single, universal cure for cancer remains elusive, we are continuing to see steadily improving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;survival and recovery rates&lt;/a&gt; across many cancer types, including cSCC – something this new research should also help with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2502114"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            The human brain shrinks as it ages, affecting the ability to remember — it’s part of life. Yet there are a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/health/superager-secrets-good-memory-wellness"&gt;lucky few, called “SuperAgers,”&lt;/a&gt; who possess a brain that fights back. For these people, memories stay as sharp as they were 30 or more years in the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000p3b6nuknd13oe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Carol Siegler, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Palatine, is a SuperAger. At 82, she won the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for her age group, which she said she entered “as a gag.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000q3b6npajp63fm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve auditioned twice for ‘Jeopardy!’ and did well enough on it to be invited to the live auditions. Then Covid hit,” Siegler told me in 2022, when she was 85.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000r3b6nm406t2k0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, Siegler is still going strong, well on her way to her 90th birthday, said Tamar Gefen, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Mesulam Institute for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at Northwestern University in Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000s3b6nnros55as@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gefen conducts research at &lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/join/SuperAging.html" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern’s SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently studying 113 SuperAgers. Over the past 25 years, however, 80 SuperAgers have donated their brain tissue to the program, which has led to some fascinating discoveries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000t3b6n0i6anhh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN spoke to Gefen about those decades of work. She is a coauthor of a new analysis of the research that was published Thursday in &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000u3b6nr2n00ao8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How do you define a SuperAger, and what have you found out about their behavior over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000v3b6ndn91795l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Tamar Gefen:&lt;/strong&gt; To be a SuperAger in our program at Northwestern, a person must be over 80 and undergo extensive cognitive testing. Acceptance in the study only occurs if the person’s episodic memory — the ability to recall everyday events and past personal history — is as good or better than cognitively normal people in their 50s and 60s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000w3b6n7yh00u99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We have screened close to 2,000 individuals who think they may be a SuperAger and less than 10% meet the criteria. Over the past 25 years, we have studied about 300 SuperAgers — a number of whom have donated their brain for research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000x3b6nkqnw5j7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One key trait of SuperAgers is that they seem to be highly social people. They value connection and are often active in their communities. This is interesting because we know isolation is a risk factor for developing  dementia, and so staying socially active is a known protective feature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000y3b6nity3vqbs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another common thread in all SuperAgers is a sense of autonomy, freedom and independence. They’re making decisions and living their lives the way that they want to live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000z3b6nt099y0o8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I feel very strongly that successful aging is not just about sociability. If a person feels trapped, tethered or burdened, especially in a vulnerable state like poor health or older age, I think it can encroach on their entire psychosocial being.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000103b6nj9f17ofq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But as far as healthy behaviors, SuperAgers run the gamut. We have SuperAgers with heart disease, diabetes, who aren’t physically active, who don’t eat any better than their similar age peers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000113b6nkmeou58e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is one SuperAger who drinks four beers every night. He laughs and says, “Maybe it’s done me wrong, but I’ll never know.” He doesn’t have an identical twin to compare his behavior to, so would he have lived to 108 instead of 98? We don’t know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000123b6n5equlk0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Many of your most intriguing discoveries have come from studying donor brain tissue. What have you discovered about the memory center of the SuperAger brain?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000133b6nqtv2k92x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gefen: &lt;/strong&gt; Our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25632151/" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that an area of the brain that is responsible for attention, motivation, and cognitive engagement — known as the cingulate cortex — is thicker in SuperAgers, even compared with those of people in their 50s and 60s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000143b6nk1hivyjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain, we found SuperAgers have three times fewer tau tangles when compared to their “normal” peers. Abnormal formations of tau proteins are one of the key signs of Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000153b6ncaivddou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Alzheimer’s disease, tau also targets the neurons of the primary neurons of the cholinergic system — which is responsible for sustaining our attention in daily life. But that doesn’t happen in the brain of a SuperAger. Therefore, the cholinergic system appears to be stronger, and likely more plastic and flexible for reasons that we’re not sure about.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000163b6ngx94ktu7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s interesting, because I see SuperAgers as focused. They can pay close attention, engage and actively listen. How else could they recall 13 out of 15 random words after 30 minutes?  I picture them engraving the words on their cortex with a chisel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000173b6ng7h24yn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            SuperAger brains also have bigger, healthier cells in the entorhinal cortex, an area essential for memory and learning, that has direct connections to the hippocampus. The entorhinal cortex, by the way, is one of the first areas of the brain to get hit by Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000183b6nkfsm8uvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180225/" target="_blank"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; we examined every layer of cells within the entorhinal cortex of SuperAgers, and we painstakingly measured the size of the neurons. We found that in layer two, which is the layer that is most important for information transmission, SuperAgers had humongous, plump, intact, beautiful, gigantic entorhinal cortex neurons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000193b6n60s2h3i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was an incredible finding, because their entorhinal neurons were even larger than those in individuals who are much younger, some even in their 30s. That told us there is a structural integrity component at play — like the architecture, the bones, the skeleton of the neuron itself is sturdier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001a3b6npz5sjyzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’re expanding the studies of these neurons to understand their biochemical signatures, determine what makes them special, and see if these signatures are found in other types of neurons in the brain of SuperAgers. Are these same neurons particularly vulnerable in those with Alzheimer’s disease, and if so, how and why?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001b3b6nfkrwktgp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What have you learned from your research about how the brain of a SuperAger reacts to injury, disease and stress?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001c3b6npbpko3mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gefen:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking at the inflammatory system in the brain of SuperAgers, with the goal of understanding how the immune cells in their brain respond to disease and adapt to stress. Inflammation, once it crosses a certain threshold, is a major component of cell loss in Alzheimer’s disease and nearly all other neurodegenerative diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001d3b6nhwsg7k20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compared with the brain of same-age peers, SuperAgers have fewer activated microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, in their white matter. White matter is the brain’s super highway, transporting information from one part of the brain to another.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001e3b6np130em0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how it works: Microglia are activated because there is some kind of antigen or disease, typically something destructive in the brain. In some cases, however, microglia and other immune cells become hyperactive and go into overdrive, thus causing inflammation and possible damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001f3b6nq6k6dvvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The brain of a SuperAger, however, has fewer activated microglia. In fact, the levels of microglia&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were on par with people in their 30s, 40s and 50s. That could mean there is less junk or disease in the brain of a SuperAger so the microglia have no need to be active. Or it could mean microglia are responding efficiently to in clearing out disease or toxins, and because they are more plastic and adaptable, the microglia are able to activate, respond and then calm down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001h3b6ncy0f936m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of this is fascinating —  it may be that at the cellular level, the immune system of a SuperAger brain could be stronger or more adaptive, much like the layers of cells we found in the entorhinal cortex.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001i3b6nn8f8ghci@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Whether or not you were born with the right genes to protect your brain sounds like the luck of the draw. What does that mean for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vbr9n001p3b6nk9lpu5y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gefen: &lt;/strong&gt;Genetics are tricky. It’s not just whether you have a gene or not, it about how your internal and external environment works together to influence how a gene is “turned on,” or expressed — some may be more highly expressed, some will have lower expression. This is the epigenetic part of the puzzle.

            There is a list of candidate genes that we are starting to study very carefully, these are genes that also have a role in aspects of longevity, senescence, cell repair and cognitive reserve to name a few.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            I’m excited about that, not only for the genetics that are heritable from parents, but also genetics at the cell level, that enable each neuron or immune cell to carry out its respective job within the brain.  With the technology that’s advancing so rapidly, I’m certain we’re going to get to a point where prevention or modification at the genetic level will be part of the playbook.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Clearly, there is not a one target resolution for Alzheimer’s disease. I know we all want that one easy fix but it’s just simply not going to happen.

            It’s going to take many teams and many specialists to come together and create a kind of personalized cocktail for prevention or treatment. I think it’s possible, but it’s going to take time.

And though 2025 might not be full of flying cars and robot servants, there are a few sci-fi tropes that ended up panning out: novels like George Orwell's "1984," and Phillip K Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" are alive and well as real-world police use &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/police-facial-recognition-random-arrest" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;expansive surveillance&lt;/a&gt; networks to bust criminals before they even do anything wrong, while the sex robot market has become a nearly &lt;a href="https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Auto-4U19225/global-sex-doll-robot" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;$350 million industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even pie-in-the-sky clichés like "second bodies" have now come to life — it just might not be the body-swapping horror one may imagine after watching 2024's "The Substance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we're treated to a different type of horror, as the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/opinion/contamination-exposome.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;' David Wallace-Wells&lt;/a&gt; points out in a scathing essay: a second body made entirely of pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his wide-ranging piece, Wallace-Wells weaves a thread through all the bits of man-made junk that have come to rest in nearly every nook and cranny of our planet. From the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;ice atop Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231023000432" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;hazy air lingering over the desert&lt;/a&gt;, and even in the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48230157" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;darkest depths of the Mariana Trench&lt;/a&gt;, plastics are there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the polymers have become a key staple of our food chain. "Plastic is now threaded through the flesh of fish, where it is interfering with reproduction, and the stalks of plants, where it is interfering with photosynthesis, and in much else we place upon our dinner plates and set about eating," Wallace-Wells notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is why scientists have found traces of microplastics in nearly every part of the human body, from appendages like &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/march/chewing-gum-can-shed-microplastics-into-saliva-pilot-study-finds.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;tongues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.beatthemicrobead.org/project/nail-polish/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;toes&lt;/a&gt; to organs including the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-025-00971-0" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But microplastics are just a sliver of the noxious industrial pie making up our second body.

When these sleep issues persist for several months or longer, it’s usually a good idea to visit a doctor to see if you have an underlying condition, like depression, restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea, that requires medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EZC65YERJZGEBA5Y4KKNVG2VNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But for occasional periods of insomnia that leave you feeling bleary-eyed, experts say there may be some dietary supplements and even foods that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="73D67XOZ2RC6VC4VA5K6YASBGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s important to recognize that no dietary supplement is going to radically improve your sleep. Supplements shouldn’t be viewed as a long-term solution. And almost all supplements carry the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VH4NAHLAHJG5JGKK7AMLTA5S3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But some may produce modest benefits, such as helping you fall asleep slightly faster at night, and carry minimal side effects when taken in smaller doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSKIBFFHZ5B4HB5L2APFMWQZYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We spoke to sleep and nutrition experts and reviewed dozens of studies to find out what the science says about five popular supplements.

It’s produced primarily in the evening. But melatonin isn’t going to quickly send you off to sleep like a fast-acting sleeping pill. Instead, it promotes sleepiness by signaling to your body that it’s nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DEP7S23IINHHNPMFQMDMMD7QVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For that reason, melatonin supplements are most helpful for people with sleep timing problems, said Phyllis C. Zee, the medical director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. That includes people with jet lag, shift workers who work late at night or early in the morning, and people who routinely struggle to fall asleep until it’s extremely late at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EZVVEH3CI5FE3N6YKGUB2AUI4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those people, taking a melatonin supplement in the evening can set their biological clocks earlier, helping them fall asleep and wake up earlier, Zee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDJNMJ65LFD67BSYADGSTK4SEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Melatonin supplements may also benefit older adults, because melatonin levels naturally decline with age, as well as postmenopausal women, said Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine specialist and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “I think some people are more sensitive to it and can get some improvements in their sleep from it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PFN3OM4T6NELHEPECSKNJG7NUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many studies have examined whether melatonin can alleviate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;insomnia, and the data is mostly mixed, Abbasi-Feinberg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273450/" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it can help people fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G3WL72KPS5ARPFUHW4XKUQHSXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the American Academy of Sleep Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; there “isn’t enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia” to recommend its use. If you find that you’re  having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at least three times a week for three months or longer — the criteria for chronic insomnia — then you should visit a doctor or a sleep specialist, Zee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ACPRGLSPKFCMXPGKZ4RT3XJT2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are going to try melatonin for an occasional sleep timing problem, it’s best that you use a low dose, around half a milligram to three milligrams, said Zee at Northwestern. You also have to get the timing right: Melatonin should be taken about two hours before bedtime for it to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSVXKGSAZ5BJTGCBB5UFKRG6CE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/25/melatonin-children-sleep-fda-study/" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that several melatonin products are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/25/melatonin-gummies-dose-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;“inaccurately labeled,”&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27855744/" target="_blank"&gt;several containing&lt;/a&gt; more melatonin than advertised.

These side effects typically occur with doses above 350 milligrams. “It’s important to note that more is not better,” said Zee at Northwestern. “Check with your doctor and let them know that you’re taking magnesium and the dose to avoid possible interactions with other medications or medical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUDCANEELVAYFIKJAVRUI32LCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A healthy gut may promote healthy sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779243/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that higher levels of gut microbiome diversity — generally considered a sign of a healthy gut — are associated with longer, better sleep and fewer nighttime awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GAGKH7I3I5HXXN3JGZKEXLTZJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many hormones and metabolites that are produced by our gut microbes act directly on the brain to influence sleep regulation, including neurotransmitters like serotonin, said Chris Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center and the author of &lt;a href="https://gutbites.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gut Bites MD&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on gut health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4VLX6SSZGZCJ3NUEYMPOIGGNAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s one reason Abbasi-Feinberg encourages her patients to consume probiotics, which are live bacteria and other microorganisms that confer health benefits. But probiotic supplements — which are available in capsules, gummies, powders and pills&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;—&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;can have some downsides. For one, they tend to contain concentrated doses of just a few strains of bacteria. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/28/probiotics-supplements-gut-health-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that taking them may actually reduce the microbial diversity in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PS25EFQFUBE4JIQGQXFNE4ARCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, Abbasi-Feinberg recommends that you get probiotics from fermented foods, like plain yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and tempeh. These fermented foods typically contain not only probiotics (the live microbes) but also prebiotics (the fiber the microbes eat) and postbiotics (the vitamins and nutrients they produce).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVCURU7VPVHM7NUMXSZPPIUTAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1602898" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;involving 29 people found that older adults who drank a little more than a half cup of fermented milk every day for three weeks fell asleep more quickly at night and had fewer nighttime awakenings compared to when they drank a placebo. Several studies have shown that fermented foods also have other health benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/04/probiotics-prebiotics-postbiotics-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ISA62BORHFDOLJ6WA7QL7U5DC4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abbasi-Feinberg said she tells patients to add fermented foods to their diets because they have the potential to improve their sleep and have very little downside. “If there’s no risk involved and the benefit is there, then they’re worth a try,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3EVRDXZNNFBKNOBKD7O3YUIDHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s well known that vitamin D is essential for building strong bones. But it’s also necessary for good sleep. Vitamin D helps the body convert tryptophan into serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in how well and how long you sleep. As &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11082867/" target="_blank"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt; noted, vitamin D receptors have been found in regions of the brain that regulate sleep, suggesting that it plays a direct role in our nightly shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZFMFEQ54MZBZVHCLGIOXQAE5YM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Vitamin D deficiencies can cause issues with low energy and low mood,” said Abbasi-Feinberg, “and sleep can be affected as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FEOH4WGTRCCPL4YN3KDYJ2XV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475473/" target="_blank"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that taking vitamin D can improve sleep. But the data are mixed, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590142721000094" target="_blank"&gt;not every study&lt;/a&gt; has shown benefits. Also, some of the studies involved taking a single large dose as a shot at weekly or biweekly intervals, rather than a daily pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5NVKIEFJNEAJKHPWPCGS33XZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abbasi-Feinberg said she sometimes encounters patients with sleep problems who work from home and rarely get any exposure to morning sunshine. “They roll out of bed and turn their computer on and, boom, they’re at work and they don’t get outside,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZR3FRL3QHBHR3LBCUHBQO3LMGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That can be a problem because exposure to sunshine helps your body produce vitamin D. It also halts production of melatonin and resets your circadian rhythm, which can help you sleep better at night. For that reason, Abbasi-Feinberg often prescribes morning sunshine to her patients — rather than a vitamin D supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMSNTDTULFBBXG54UT2YO7JRTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The best way to get vitamin D is to go out into the sunshine,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="list-header-SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4-42" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;h2 id="SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5.

Nowadays, it’s commonly recommended as a sleep aid. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/04/should-i-take-ashwagandha-benefits-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it can help with insomnia.

In a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257843" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, scientists analyzed five randomized trials involving 400 people that looked at the effects of ashwagandha on sleep compared to placebo. They found a “small but significant effect” of ashwagandha on overall sleep. People who were assigned to take an ashwagandha supplement daily slept on average about 25 minutes longer each night and had greater improvements in sleep quality compared to people who were given placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N2UDOF6BI5BBVES7PJBMVY6WAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the scientists also cautioned that there was limited data on ashwagandha’s potentially serious side effects, and they said that more research was needed to determine whether it was safe for long-term use. (It has been linked to a handful of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/" target="_blank"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UMG6LVAE3ZHHDDMHCKJGQITQ4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abassi-Feinberg said she doesn’t necessarily discourage people from trying ashwagandha or other Ayurvedic remedies to help them sleep if they’re not known to be harmful. But she feels that there’s not enough strong evidence to recommend them. “I’m not enthusiastic about them because I feel like the data just aren’t there yet,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQW3RIPEAZGEBEEEXDFS66UFOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/04/should-i-take-ashwagandha-benefits-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;also recommend&lt;/a&gt; that some people avoid ashwagandha altogether for safety reasons, such as women who are pregnant or nursing, people with an autoimmune,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;liver, or thyroid disorder, and people who are taking sedative medications such as gabapentin or benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

This method can isolate &lt;a href="https://www.centenary.org.au/news/vascular-endothelial-cells/"&gt;vascular&lt;/a&gt; and immune cells from brain tissue and measure their gene activity and chromatin accessibility (how 'open' DNA is to being used by the cell).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170421" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170421" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainTissue.jpg" alt="Brain tissue" class="wp-image-170421 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainTissue.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainTissue-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170421" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied brain tissue.

Certain variants suggested inflammatory immune cells could be triggering or accelerating Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before this, we knew these genetic variants increased disease risk, but we didn't know where or how they acted in the context of brain barrier cell types," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/blood-vessels-and-immune-cells-drive-risk-alzheimers-and-stroke"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Madigan Reid, from the Gladstone Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that many of the variants are actually functioning in blood vessels and immune cells in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are complex and affected &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/award-winning-image-reveals-a-hidden-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;by many factors&lt;/a&gt;, so progress in fighting them is slow. However, this latest study gets us another step closer to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;understanding how diseases like Alzheimer's work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;These 4 Distinct Patterns May Signal Alzheimer's According to Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-says-expert"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has already linked Alzheimer's disease to broader issues with the immune system, not just within the brain.

Nonopioid medications, such as the gabapentinoids pregabalin and gabapentin, are widely prescribed for chronic pain, the investigators, led by Elizabeth Park, MD, Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregabalin has greater potency than gabapentin in binding to the α2δ subunit of the L-type calcium channel and therefore may be associated with an increased risk for HF through actions to cause sodium/water retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, investigators evaluated 246,237 Medicare beneficiaries between 2014 and 2018, including 18,622 (8%) new pregabalin users and 227,615 (92%) new gabapentin users. All patients were aged 65-89 years, had chronic noncancer pain, and had no history of HF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for an extensive list of 231 covariates to reduce confounding and attempted to closely emulate a hypothetical target trial in which Medicare patients filled new prescriptions for pregabalin or gabapentin for noncancer pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 114,113 person-years of follow-up, 1470 patients had a hospital admission or emergency department visit for HF. The rate of HF per 1000 person-years was 18.2 for pregabalin and 12.5 — translating to roughly six additional HF events annually for every 1000 patients treated with pregabalin — with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was even more pronounced in patients with a history of CVD, with an adjusted HR of 1.85. An increased risk for outpatient HF diagnoses was also seen (adjusted HR, 1.27), but there was no difference in all-cause mortality between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the findings further support current recommendations from the European Medicines Agency to exercise caution when prescribing pregabalin to older adults with CVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association currently lists pregabalin, but not gabapentin, as a medication that may cause or exacerbate HF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate Clinical Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-authors of an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837134" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;invited commentary&lt;/a&gt; noted that the study provides “timely and clinically relevant insights” into the cardiovascular safety of these two widely used gabapentinoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a clinical standpoint, the findings have “immediate clinical implications,” wrote Robert Zhang, MD, with Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, and Edo Birati, MD, Tzafon (Poriya) Medical Center, Poriya, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For older adults with chronic pain, particularly those with CVD, “clinicians should weigh the potential cardiovascular risks associated with pregabalin against its analgesic benefits. This is particularly relevant given the growing use of gabapentinoids in older populations and ongoing polypharmacy issues in this age group,” Zhang and Birati advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Furthermore, if pregabalin use is associated with new-onset HF, it raises the possibility that the drug may unmask underlying subclinical cardiovascular disease, which suggests a need for careful cardiac evaluation prior to prescribing this medication,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study serves as an important reminder that not all gabapentinoids are created equal and that in the pursuit of safer pain control, vigilance for unintended harms remains paramount,” the investigators concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study had no commercial funding.

&lt;p&gt;If anyone needed a reminder that US health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has no background in science or medicine, look no further than &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766"&gt;the video he posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two-and-a-half-minute clip, Kennedy announced that he is cancelling nearly $500 million in funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats. The funding will be clawed back from 22 now-defunct contracts awarded through the federal agency tasked with developing medical countermeasures to public health threats. The agency is the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is generally opposed to vaccines, but he is particularly hostile to mRNA-based vaccines. Since the remarkably successful debut of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic—which were developed and mass-produced with unprecedented speed—Kennedy has continually disparaged and spread misinformation about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video on Tuesday, Kennedy continued that trend, erroneously saying that, "as the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don't perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract." In reality, COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;more than 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in the US in just the first two years of the pandemic and additionally prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations in the US in that time. Nearly all &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccine-doses-by-manufacturer?country=~USA"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines used in the US&lt;/a&gt; are mRNA-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy's video only went more off the rails from there. He continued on with this nonsensical explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem: mRNA only codes for a small part of viral proteins usually a single antigen. One mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective. This dynamic drives a phenomenon called antigenic shift meaning that the vaccine paradoxically encourages new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics as the virus constantly mutates to escape the protective effects of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fact-check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack this nonsense, let's start with how mRNA-based vaccines work. These vaccines deliver a snippet of genetic code—in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA)—to cells. Our cells then translate that mRNA code into a protein that the immune system can, essentially, use for target practice, producing antibodies and cell-based responses against it. After that, if the immune system ever encounters that snippet on an actual invading virus or other germ, it will then recognize it and mount a protective response. Such snippets of germs or other harmful things that can prompt an immune response are generally called antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;After gaining Hollywood recognition in 2021, GLP-1 drugs remain as popular as ever. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-no-sex-drive/" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, the queen bee of these weight-loss medications, is only approved to treat type 2 diabetes. However, that hasn’t stopped celebrities and the average patient from using the drug off-label as an appetite suppressant. But with those figure-slimming perks come a score of potentially dangerous side effects, one of which has doctors very concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/weight-loss-drugs-pancreatitis/"&gt;Ozempic and Mounjaro Patients Report Potentially Fatal New Side Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doctors are worried about Ozempic-related muscle loss.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without proper dietary guidelines in place, taking GLP-1 drugs can be a slippery slope, many doctors have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s this constant struggle between eating protein and making sure you’re meeting your nutritional requirements, and then taking this drug that doesn’t allow you to eat,” explained anesthesiologist &lt;strong&gt;Nicole Martin&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, on her &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3GoE53zOvM&amp;amp;list=PLiGFuLdrTqlSz0iV5_NM41-0KwplHfLz-&amp;amp;index=8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scrubs to Stilettos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This merry-go-round can cause patients to become “nutritionally deficient” and “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-skinny-fat/"&gt;skinny fat&lt;/a&gt;,” a term used to describe someone with a low BMI (body mass index) but lack of muscle density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you restrict your calories, and you don’t eat well, and you don’t exercise, now you’re losing lean muscle mass,” further explained &lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Moon&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, doctor and &lt;i&gt;Scrubs to Stilettos&lt;/i&gt; podcast co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;i&gt;Best Life&lt;/i&gt; previously reported, “Strong muscles contribute to osteoporosis prevention, joint protection, bone growth, and better balance. A 2024 study published in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt; found that taking GLP-1 drugs led to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/weight-loss-drugs-bone-loss/"&gt;decreased muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and increased bone mineral density (BMD).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming side effect was also flagged in a recent study conducted by nutrition experts from the University of Utah College of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-hair-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic Patients Report Another Troubling Side Effect: “I’ve Lost at Least Half My Hair.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GLP-1 drugs can cause a 10% reduction in lean muscle mass.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic can decrease lean muscle mass by roughly 10 percent, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://gophysiotherapy.co.uk/lean-muscle-mass-important/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in lean body mass—defined as “body weight that isn’t fat”—can disrupt your energy levels, skeletal muscles, and bone strength, “potentially compromising physical functions and quality of life, particularly in those susceptible to sarcopenia,” warned the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preclinical mouse model, researchers observed negative changes in lean mass and muscle exertion. Notably, about 45 percent of weight loss was attributed to a reduction in lean mass. Skeletal muscle also shrank by six percent, and “they found that, for some muscles, strength decreased as the mice lost weight,” per the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092776" target="_blank"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors cautioned against “drawing a one-to-one parallel with humans,” noting that both weight gain and loss have varying effects on mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these results do corroborate previous theories about Ozempic’s adverse effect on lean muscle mass. In fact, their research ties back to a 2023 AARP report that revealed “for every pound you lose, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/anti-obesity-medications-risks/" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;about 25 percent&lt;/a&gt; is muscle and bone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ozempic is also known to cause bone loss.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone frailty and weaker muscles are a natural sign of aging; however, certain medications, such as Ozempic, can &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/avoid-ozempic-over-65/"&gt;expedite these changes&lt;/a&gt; in adults 65 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Significant weight loss, especially over a short time, can also contribute to a decrease in bone density, which may put older adults at increased risk of bone fractures or exacerbate pre-existing conditions such as osteoporosis,” &lt;strong&gt;HaVy Ngo-Hamilton&lt;/strong&gt;, PharmD, a pharmacist and clinical consultant at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.buzzrx.com/blog/authors/havy-ngo-pharmd" target="_blank"&gt;BuzzRx&lt;/a&gt;, previously explained to &lt;em&gt;Best Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it can make this age group more susceptible to “health complications, disability, and mobility issues,” she added. Consequently, many health officials don’t encourage Ozempic treatment in geriatrics.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is one of the cruelest conditions a person can develop. And even with recent advances, there’s only so much that can be done once its symptoms emerge. Research out this week might highlight a critical and previously missed factor driving the disease, one that could even lead to new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Harvard Medical School led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. By studying human brain samples and mice, they found evidence that our brains naturally contain the element lithium—and that its deficiency can help explain the damage caused by Alzheimer’s. The findings are well supported and may have uncovered an important aspect of the neurological disorder, an outside expert told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers “have performed detailed and well-designed studies to investigate how low lithium levels are associated with [Alzheimer’s disease] at the diagnostic, protein, cellular and gene levels,” said Timothy Chang, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study. Chang is also director of the California Alzheimer’s Disease Center at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brains of people with Alzheimer’s are different in many ways from others. In particular, they contain high levels of misfolded amyloid beta and tau, two proteins that normally have important functions. But these aren’t the only changes seen in Alzheimer’s. And it was while investigating these other changes that the Harvard researchers made their discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the help of existing projects that collected postmortem tissue samples, they compared levels of around 30 metals in the brains of people who died along varying stages of cognitive health. The only major difference they found was with lithium. People with cognitively healthy brains had relatively high levels of lithium, whereas those with Alzheimer’s had much lower levels. Importantly, this loss of lithium was apparent even in people who only experienced mild memory problems before dying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also studied healthy mice and genetically modified mice that develop a version of Alzheimer’s disease. When they depleted lithium from these mice, it appeared to accelerate the buildup of unhealthy amyloid beta and tau in the brain, along with memory decline. They also found evidence that this loss is caused by amyloid beta plaques binding to the brain’s lithium and that this loss of lithium seems to negatively affect all of the brain’s major cell types.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though there has been some limited research &lt;a href="https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-024-00348-5"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; a possible connection between lithium and Alzheimer’s, the authors say theirs is the first to show that our brains naturally carry it. What’s more, their findings hint that lithium is essential to good brain health and that its absence is key to the development of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is the first study to suggest that lithium deficiency might contribute to Alzheimer’s disease. The reason this has not been proposed is because it was not believed that lithium is a natural substance in the brain with biological effect, just a drug with pharmacological effects at high doses,” senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in Harvard Medical School’s Blavatnik Institute, told Gizmodo. “As such, this study is the first to explore the consequences of lithium deficiency in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The implications of this study, while still early, could certainly be dramatic. Yankner and his team were also able to identify a lithium-based compound that wasn’t so easily bound by amyloid beta. And when they gave mice (older healthy mice and mice with Alzheimer’s) this compound, it appeared to prevent the damaging brain changes and memory loss normally inevitable with the neurodegenerative condition. Even the best amyloid-based &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fda-approval-for-leqembi-drug-alzheimers-treatment-1850615742"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer’s available today, by contrast, only modestly delay its progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other forms of lithium are used in medicine to treat certain mental health disorders, particularly depression. But these versions require high dosages to work as intended and come with many side effects as a result. The team’s compound, however, required a much lower dose to be effective in the mice, and no sign of toxicity was observed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Further clinical studies in humans would be necessary to evaluate if the right type and dose of lithium can prevent or slow Alzheimer’s disease,” Chang noted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yankner and his team are now moving ahead with the research needed to show their compound (or something similar) can be safely tested in human clinical trials. But even before then, the team’s discovery could pay off in other ways. It might be possible to screen for Alzheimer’s risk in the future by measuring people’s lithium levels, for example. And there are still many mysteries left to untangle about lithium and its role in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“As a neuroscientist, I am excited about exploring the physiology of lithium in the brain,” Yankner said. “I suspect we have just scratched the surface of what will be some very interesting biology.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

She had been discharged twice from Sydney Children’s Hospital earlier that day.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Northern Beaches Hospital spokesperson confirmed that the tragic death of the child, who we understand to be a six year old girl, will be subject to a Coronial Inquest.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl was initially taken to Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick, and was discharged only to be re-presented by her father a short time later. She was then diagnosed with influenza and discharged again.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was later brought to Northern Beaches Hospital, where she later died.

&lt;p&gt;It has left a tight school community in shock as they support her bereft parents, who we understand advocated for her care persistently.  We have elected to withhold details of the school and family at this time, and will update if permission is given to provide these details.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hospitals respond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Northern Beaches Hospital spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Manly Observer&lt;/em&gt; this evening, via a statement, that they were “deeply saddened by the tragic loss of a young child.”


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our heartfelt condolences go out to the child’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alongside Sydney Children’s Hospital Network, where the child received care earlier in the day, we will undertake the appropriate investigations in line with NSW Health policy, including a joint independent review. A coronial inquest has also been called into the child’s passing.”


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we cannot comment on the specifics of the case during the review period, our thoughts are with the family, and we will continue to offer them our full support.&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sydney Children’s Hospital confirmed that the patient had been discharged twice on Monday, 4 August. They said a patient “presented to the Emergency Department at Sydney Children’s SCHN and Following clinical assessment, the child was discharged.”


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement continues: “The patient represented shortly after, and following a diagnosis of influenza, was discharged with at-home guidance.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network (SCHN) has learnt the patient later tragically died.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SCHN expresses our deepest condolences to the family for the loss of their child.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SCHN is progressing an initial review into the patient’s care while at the hospital. Based on this initial review, SCHN will work with Northern Sydney Local Health District as part of the joint independent clinical governance process.”


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter has been referred to the Coroner.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal reviews are usually conducted within 100 days.
