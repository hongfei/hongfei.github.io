In severe cases, Salmonella Dublin can kill people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Making matters worse, the new study revealed that cattle strains have the highest levels of antibiotic resistance, particularly to drugs meant for treating infections, such as tetracycline and cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increasing antibiotic resistance means that infections may become harder to treat, potentially leading to longer illnesses or more severe symptoms for people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If treatments become less effective, human infections could become more dangerous, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, or those with weak immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study authors added that the US, being a major beef and dairy-producing country, is at an even greater risk of this superbug turning into a widespread health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cattle are the main carriers of a superbug called Salmonella Dublin, an antibiotic-resistant bacterium (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Penn State researchers (pictured) found that the bacteria was present in cows, people, and in both food and farm surfaces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used data from two public sources: the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Isolate Browser and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These provided whole-genome sequences of Salmonella Dublin, which allowed the team to examine each strain's genes in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They compared 581 samples from cattle, 664 from humans, and 905 from the environment (food and farm areas) to identify patterns in how the bacteria's genes cause severe disease and resist antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria from cows, people, and the environment were incredibly similar, with 72 percent of the 2,150 strains differing by only a few DNA changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although cow strains had the most genes that were resistant to medication, those found contaminating food and surfaces had more DNA mutations linked to quinolone resistance, a drug used to treat humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00689-25"&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt; warned that each strain examined had similar genes that make them dangerous, like those helping them stick to cells or invade the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These genes were present in almost every strain in cows, people, or food, meaning the bacteria are consistently harmful no matter where it's found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study leader Erika Ganda, an associate professor of food animal microbiomes, said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/bacteria-strains-infecting-cattle-and-humans-us-are-highly-similar"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;: 'That's important, because it shows that Salmonella Dublin is highly connected across humans, animals and the environment — so efforts to control it need to consider all three.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Contaminated beef can make people sick with Salmonella Dublin, leading to blood infections (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Direct contact on farms can also transmit the bacteria from cattle to people (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/9/17-0136_article"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) has estimated that Salmonella bacteria, including Dublin, cause about 1.2 million illnesses every year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Salmonella Dublin infections have been particularly severe due to their tendency to cause bloodstream infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2005 and 2013, a staggering 78 percent of Salmonella Dublin infections required hospitalization, and 4.2 percent resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) treats Salmonella outbreaks, including those involving Dublin, as high-risk health emergencies, often issuing urgent recalls to prevent their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One incident in 2019 saw 34,222 pounds of contaminated ground beef from Central Valley Meat Company in California recalled to prevent a large-scale outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, 13 people were infected with Salmonella Dublin in the state, and one died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now that the bacterium has become resistant to antibiotics, the threat to humans is greater than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC has said that antibiotic-resistant infections, including those from Salmonella, cause over 2.8 million illnesses and more than 35,000 deaths each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers emphasized the need for a 'One Health' approach, combining efforts in human, animal, and environmental health to control the superbug's spread and reduce antibiotic use in livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/menopause-dental-dry-mouth-estrogen-414c39e119f4d3f17e9be289c9dd6914"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can usher in a host of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/menopause-work-benefit-hot-flash-insomnia-support-c91eb76a8802c3dbbd5a0fdef219086c"&gt;disruptive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; like hot flashes, night sweats and sleep problems. Hormone therapy promises relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many women wonder about taking it. That’s because the treatment, subject of a recent expert panel convened by the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, has long been shrouded in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once used routinely. But in 2002, research testing one type was stopped early because of concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and blood clots. Concerns lingered even though later studies showed the benefits of today’s hormone therapies outweigh the risks for many women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is still a lot of confusion and a lot of fear,” said Grayson Leverenz, a 50-year-old from Durham, North Carolina, who hesitated to take it but is glad she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others increasingly are also giving hormone therapy a second look. But experts continue to disagree about how to present the treatment’s pros and cons. The FDA-assembled panel stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions — prompting dozens of experts to call for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say hormone therapy is a great option for many, but not all, menopausal women — and it’s important to understand the nuanced reality of these treatments before deciding what’s best.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;How hormone therapy works &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It treats symptoms that can arise when menstruation winds down and ends, causing levels of estrogen and progesterone to drop very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Because it’s applied into the vagina, very little circulates in the blood and the risks are far lower. Doctors say it’s a good option for women whose biggest complaint is vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-body therapy includes pills, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms like hot flashes. Such systemic hormones include estrogens and progestogens.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zwink, a nurse in Castle Rock, Colorado, began using an estrogen patch more than a year ago and also has an IUD, which gives her progesterone. The treatment has relieved her hot flashes, improved her sleep and eased her joint pain and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like a 100% magic wand,” she said. “But it definitely has made a significant difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Menopause Society says hormone therapy can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease if started within 10 years of reaching menopause. It may also reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and maintain bone density for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might have a drop in their bone density at age 60" instead of at age 50, said Dr. MargEva Morris Cole, an OB-GYN with Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Hormone therapy carries some risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Leverenz was first prescribed hormone therapy last year, she kept worrying about the risks she’d heard about — then finally decided: “I can’t live like this anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a combination of three medications, her anxiety lifted, her sleep improved, her joint pain and hot flashes went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like myself again,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say many patients hesitate to try hormones, and they try to reassure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women can use estrogen therapy for seven years – and estrogen-progestogen therapy for three to five years – before breast cancer risk goes up, according to the Menopause Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group says both estrogen therapy and estrogen-progestogen therapy increase the risk of stroke, which goes away soon after stopping hormones. The risk of blood clots rises if you take hormones by mouth, but may be lower if you use a patch, gel or spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these risks are small,” said Dr. Nanette Santoro, an OB-GYN at the University of Colorado. “And they have to be weighed against the benefit of symptom relief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, medical history and how long women stay on the hormones are also considerations. Many women take them for around five years, and those who’ve had a stroke or certain other conditions may be advised against using them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Debate on changing warnings on hormone medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are divided over whether there should be changes in “black box” health warnings on some hormone treatments. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the physicians at the recent expert panel meeting convened by the FDA prescribe the hormones or are involved with a pharmaceutical industry campaign opposing the warning label. A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that “removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk,” and asked the agency to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, doctors urge people to be wary of misinformation, like false claims on social media posts that hormones will prevent dementia and ensure a healthy old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t say that you are going to live a longer, healthier life because you took hormones,” Duke’s Cole said. “I don’t want the pendulum to go so far that people feel that it is promising health for the next 30 to 40 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to hormone therapy for menopause &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro pointed to a new non-hormonal medication called fezolinetant, marketed as Veozah, for hot flashes and night sweats. The anti-epileptic medication gabapentin, in low doses, can also be used for hot flashes and a moisturizer can improve vaginal dryness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also say regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro urged against the “wild proliferation” of supplements claiming to be menopause cure-alls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody is in on the menopause gold rush,” she said. “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering," Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore," Fello said. "We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A "first-of-its-kind technology"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/stroke-treatment-vivistim/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vivistim System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf21/P210007B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22279-vagus-nerve" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They regulate the body's involuntary functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in "greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors," Nossek said in emailed remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use," Nossek said. "This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 108-person trial &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00475-X/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published in The Lancet in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have "moderate to severe deficits" qualify for the device, the company &lt;a href="https://microtransponder.showpad.com/share/D0VkrCHvDXiqoQf11CiVP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implant aids in recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with "less than 1% chance of any complications." Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't "something he could have done before." Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The sky's the limit"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/robotic-coach-offer-new-hope-for-stroke-patients-on-the-road-to-recovery/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;other new technologies&lt;/a&gt; may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back," Bain said. "In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but &lt;a href="https://www.vivistim.com/find-a-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;shared a map&lt;/a&gt; that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back," Covey said. "This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down." &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You might expect that with age comes a natural progression of brain degeneration, but new research shows that this might not be the case for all regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of mouse and human brains suggests that some parts of the somatosensory cortex – the part of the brain that processes sensory information – aren't just exempt from the thinning found in other parts, they actually grow stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result suggests that the brain's ability to adapt and change continues, even into older age – and that the more you use it, the stronger your brain could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Humans Age Faster at 2 Sharp Peaks – Here's When&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until now, it had not been considered that the primary somatosensory cortex consists of a stack of several extremely thin layers of tissue, each with its own architecture and function. We have now found that these layers age differently," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;explains neuroscientist Esther Kühn&lt;/a&gt; of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the cerebral cortex becomes thinner overall, some of its layers remain stable or, surprisingly, are even thicker with age. Presumably because they are particularly solicited and thus retain their functionality. We therefore see evidence for neuroplasticity, that is, adaptability, even in senior people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171357" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/study-schematic.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-171357" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/study-schematic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/study-schematic-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171357" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An overview of the human portion of the study. (Liu et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and requirements, reorganizing and rewiring its neural connections to support evolving needs. The assumption is that neuroplasticity peaks when you're young, and gradually declines with age; however, this assumption is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101514"&gt;not necessarily supported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.09.004"&gt;robust evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by neuroscientists Peng Liu and Juliane Doehler of &lt;span&gt;Otto von Guericke University &lt;/span&gt;Magdeburg in Germany, a team of researchers undertook a study of possible age-related changes in the human cerebral cortex, a folded region of the brain that usually thins with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is generally assumed that less brain volume means reduced function," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;. "However, little is known about how exactly the cortex actually ages. This is remarkable, given that many of our daily activities depend on a functioning cortex. That's why we examined the situation with high-resolution brain scans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took particularly sensitive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="171348" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; brain scans of 61 adults between the ages of 21 and 80, focusing on a small region at the top of the brain called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex"&gt;primary somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which receives tactile sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this region is structured a little bit like a stack of crepes: multiple layers of extremely thin, delicate tissue, each with its own role. These layers, the brain scans revealed, present differently depending on a person's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are thinner in older people, as expected; but the middle and upper layers were found to be thicker in older people than the same layers seen in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The middle layer is effectively the gateway for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_perception"&gt;haptic&lt;/a&gt; [touch] stimuli. In the layers above, further processing occurs," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kühn. "For example, in the case of sensory stimuli from the hand, the upper layers are particularly involved in the interaction between neighboring fingers. This is important when grasping objects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower layers, by contrast, were thinner in the older patients. These are the layers that handle modulation, where tactile signals are amplified or suppressed, depending on context. For example, you don't tend to feel your clothing unless you're thinking about it – similar to the way &lt;a href="https://www.ceenta.com/news-blog/why-cant-i-see-my-nose"&gt;your brain edits out your nose&lt;/a&gt; from your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to why different layers thicken or thin with age, the team suggests it could come down to the old adage of "use it or lose it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The middle and upper layers of the cortex are most directly exposed to external stimuli. They are permanently active because we have constant contact with our environment," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;. "The neural circuits in the lower layers are stimulated to a lesser extent, especially in later life. I therefore see our findings as an indication that the brain preserves what is used intensively. That's a feature of neuroplasticity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although the lower layers shrink, they may compensate for any cellular degeneration. Their myelin content was found to increase in response to an increase in a certain type of neuron that amplifies the modulation signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another sign of adaptability, and the researchers hope that, in future research, they may be able to find a way to promote these adaptive mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, our findings are consistent with the general idea that we can do something good for our brains with appropriate stimulation. I think it's an optimistic notion that we can influence our aging process to a certain degree," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02013-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Since my husband’s mother found out, she has made it her personal mission to put a halt to the event.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmen5dsn9001r3b79sdr98tgt@published"&gt;She claims that we are “inviting disaster” by holding it and accepting gifts for our baby before he arrives. I have told her that if she is not comfortable attending, that’s fine, but she doesn’t get to decide for me. Her response has been to tell me to go ahead, but “don’t be surprised when the baby is stillborn.” I’ve had enough. She is really starting to cast a pall over what should be a happy occasion. My husband tells me she’s always been superstitious and to just ignore her. Easy for him to say—he’s not the one who’s pregnant! How can I convince him that he needs to get his mother to keep her opinions to herself?&lt;/p&gt;

Or, at any rate, I wouldn’t bother, because even if you convinced &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, he’d still have to convince her. (And if his response to you is that you ought to ignore her—presumably that’s what he does—I am pretty sure he knows he won’t be able to convince her. Not to mention that he doesn’t want to be bothered trying.)&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve already told her where you stand; she’s blown right by that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; escalated things. Someone who tells you your baby is going to be stillborn is not someone you need to hear from. So stop speaking to her altogether until after the baby is born. I wouldn’t even make a production of it: I’d just say, “Oh, sorry, can’t talk now” whenever she calls—or not pick up the phone when you see it’s her. If she stops in for a visit, you’ll be just on your way out.&lt;/p&gt;

If she complains about your freeze-out to her son—and she will—that’s his chance to say something to her, which is what you wanted in the first place. If nothing else, he can explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re icing her out. That conversation will be good for both of them. Will it change her? Doubtful. But the most important outcome of this is that you won’t have to listen to the dreadful things she has to say anymore. And you can keep this strategy in your back pocket for after the baby is born, if she tries to get under your skin then too. You are under no obligation to put up with her (or anyone’s) bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

My very good friend, let’s call her Stacy, was married years ago, to a man whose niece had a daughter at 16. My friend and her husband stepped up and took care of the baby most days for 18 months, until the birth mother came to them and announced that she just couldn’t do it anymore. They ended up adopting the baby. A couple years later, the birth mom came to them with the fact that she was pregnant again. Stacy and her husband adopted this baby at birth. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/03/adoption-disclosure-teenagers-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;They raised both girls for the next two years before divorcing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potassium absorption isn't significantly affected by when you eat a banana.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The body naturally balances potassium levels based on intake and current needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A varied, nutrient-rich diet is more important than banana timing for potassium benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bananas are a go-to snack for good reason: they’re convenient, tasty and packed with nutrients. There’s no denying that bananas are an excellent source of potassium. A medium-sized banana is loaded with around 420 mg of potassium, which is about 12 to 16 percent of your daily needs (2,600 mg for females and 3,400 mg for males).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is a mineral and electrolyte that plays some very important roles in supporting overall health. It helps keep your body hydrated, supports cell and nerve functioning and maintains healthy muscle and heart function, yet most Americans don’t get enough of it each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re aiming to get the biggest potassium benefit from your banana, does the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when you eat it actually matter? We asked registered dietitians to weigh in—and the answer might surprise you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-banana-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Banana Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truth be told, there is no single “best time” or “worst time” to eat a banana for maximum potassium intake. This is because timing doesn’t have much of an impact on potassium absorption, as opposed to other nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our body absorbs potassium passively, like a sponge,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Once it has absorbed enough or reached an optimal level, absorption becomes limited.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, your body’s pretty good at figuring out what it needs, regardless of when you eat potassium-rich foods. When you eat a banana, your body will figure out what to do that’s best in the moment to maintain a nutritional equilibrium so you don’t experience any negative symptoms, like low blood pressure, dizziness or muscle aches,” says &lt;a href="https://tracynutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-influences-potassium-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Influences Potassium Absorption? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is absorbed in the small intestine, and your body generally does a good job of using what you consume. But certain factors can affect potassium levels—like high sodium intake, some medications, vomiting or diarrhea and underlying health conditions that impact how your body retains or excretes potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think of potassium levels like a see-saw, Beckerman says. “If you are eating foods that are putting too much potassium into your body, excretion will be high, so levels remain stable,” she says. “If intake is too low, excretion will be low, so it is conserved in the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The kidneys do much of this balancing act. If your potassium stores are low, your body will hold on to the necessary amount of potassium when you eat potassium-rich foods. But if your potassium levels are appropriate, your body will excrete the excess through the urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other nutrients you eat with bananas don't have much of an impact on potassium absorption. “Potassium acts alone as an electrolyte that does its own thing, regardless if it’s ingested with other macronutrients like proteins, fat and carbohydrates,” Beckerman says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-the-most-potassium-from-your-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get the Most Potassium from Your Bananas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of stressing over banana timing, focus on building a nutrient-rich eating pattern. “Eating a variety of whole plant foods supports a balanced diet that promotes heart and overall health, while also helping regulate healthy potassium levels in conjunction with other nutrients,” Han says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, bananas aren’t the only potassium heroes. Other potassium-rich foods to include are potatoes, Swiss chard and spinach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another tip: keep your sodium in check. Potassium and sodium work together in the body, so maintaining a healthy sodium level can help your body maintain the right balance between sodium and potassium in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re aiming to get the best potassium benefit from eating bananas, the time you choose to eat one does not really matter. Potassium absorption tends to be efficient regardless of timing. Bananas can help support your body’s potassium needs, whether you eat them morning, evening, or mid-day. Rather than stressing over the perfect time to eat a banana for maximum potassium benefits, focus on getting enough potassium-rich foods in your diet.&lt;br&gt;

Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;, unfortunately, is everywhere—in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn’t pose a threat to humans. &lt;em&gt;Usually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal places for Legionnaire’s to grow and spread. They’re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person’s lungs when they inhale.

Doctors flag it during routine check-ups, health apps warn about its deficiency, and pharmacies are stocked with pills and drops promising quick fixes. Yet, step back, and the irony is hard to miss: this is the one vitamin our bodies are perfectly capable of making, provided we get enough sunlight. But modern life doesn’t always allow for it. Between long hours indoors, sunscreen use, pollution, and lifestyle shifts, vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most widespread nutritional gaps of our time. While sunlight remains the gold standard, food can play a critical supporting role. For vegetarians, who don’t have access to fish or other animal-heavy sources, the options are fewer but not absent. Here are some vegetarian-friendly ways to sneak vitamin D onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>没有激光的LASIK ？科学家可能已经找到了一种方法- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPRmtJWW80VmxXdHRGS1p5M2U3SnRNNmVyQVRuNXRFZEczc0JQM0RRNTJ3UkM5STZTUmk4bzlHVzBKN2RXMzZpcG5pSEQ4QlBfS0Jqb05xRlM4ckRlUVVEODMzSDBnakREOGJzNHF4aXB5Y1Vya1NObjBOa3pxRkZyRkJLOGt1S1ZkSm1Z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;What if you could fix your damaged eye without having to shoot a laser at it? Scientists have potentially discovered a novel method of repairing the cornea, similar to LASIK, that wouldn’t require a laser or other invasive surgical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Occidental College and the University of California, Irvine, created the technique, which aims to temporarily make the cornea malleable. In experiments with rabbit eyeballs, their method appeared to work while also leaving corneal cells alive. More research is needed to vet the procedure, but if all goes well, it could become a preferred alternative to LASIK, the researchers claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a long road between what we’ve done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible,” said lead researcher Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, in a &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/august/an-alternative-to-lasik-without-the-lasers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Chemical Society.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why some people avoid LASIK&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774"&gt;LASIK&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used to treat conditions like myopia, farsightedness, or astigmatism. It reshapes the cornea—the transparent, outer layer of the eye that captures and focuses light onto the retina—using a precise cutting laser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though generally safe and effective, the surgery does permanently weaken the structural integrity of the cornea. People will also commonly experience side effects like dry eye and visual disturbances like halos; a small few will even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319231/"&gt;develop&lt;/a&gt; serious, if rare, complications like chronic nerve pain. Ideally, the team’s method would avoid these risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A potentially safer method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technique is called electromechanical reshaping. Some of the authors had previously used it to manipulate other parts of the body that contain collagen and water, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5008912/"&gt;ears&lt;/a&gt;. It works by altering the pH of the tissue via short bursts of electricity, briefly allowing it to be molded as desired. Once the proper pH is restored, the tissue returns to its original rigid state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers used the technique on rabbit eyeballs in the lab, some of which were intended to represent myopia in humans. Special contact lenses made from platinum were placed over the extracted eyes. These lenses served as an electrode, providing a base for how the cornea should be correctly reshaped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the researchers lightly zapped the eye, the cornea became flexible and contoured to the shape of the lens. Not only did the cornea fill out as the researchers wanted, but the procedure didn’t seem to kill any corneal cells or otherwise affect the cornea’s stability. A YouTube video describing the team’s approach, from the American Chemical Society, can be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbJWbUt0m0"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers admit that it will take more research in animals before they can even think about testing their method in humans. Their next planned step is to try out the procedure on living rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the potential for the team’s work is certainly there, and it may extend beyond treating myopia. The researchers are also hoping to explore whether electromechanical reshaping can help repair farsightedness, astigmatism, and possibly even some forms of cloudy vision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as has been the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/odds-winning-nih-grants-plummet-new-funding-policy-and-spending-delays-bite"&gt;case for many scientists&lt;/a&gt; during the second Trump administration, the researchers say their work has been delayed over concerns in securing additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="19a955fe-676b-4680-ae59-0ca1ec76fecc"&gt;Missing your morning coffee is a headache — literally. Though caffeine is often used to kick-start a day or deliver an energy boost, a sudden drop in consumption can cause painful headaches. And for those trying to kick a coffee habit entirely, the pain can be particularly agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caffeine withdrawal headaches can be surprisingly intense," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/nolan-pearson-5036486.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/nolan-pearson-5036486.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Nolan Pearson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and headache specialist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, told Live Science. "It can trigger a migraine-type headache, so it can be pulsing, pounding, throbbing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="19a955fe-676b-4680-ae59-0ca1ec76fecc-2"&gt;But why is caffeine withdrawal so excruciating? Neurologists still aren't entirely sure, but they have a few theories and some tips on how to treat these nasty headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8e1f1892-402e-4817-b8d8-98d85bc05a5f"&gt;Caffeine withdrawal headaches occur after a person consumes more than 200 milligrams of caffeine — the amount in about two cups of coffee — per day for more than two weeks and then abruptly stops, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ichd-3.org/8-headache-attributed-to-a-substance-or-its-withdrawal/8-3-headache-attributed-to-substance-withdrawal/8-3-1-caffeine-withdrawal-headache/" target="_blank" data-url="https://ichd-3.org/8-headache-attributed-to-a-substance-or-its-withdrawal/8-3-headache-attributed-to-substance-withdrawal/8-3-1-caffeine-withdrawal-headache/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Classification of Headache Disorders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ICHD-3). The headaches usually appear within 24 hours without caffeine, and typically go away within one week or when caffeine is consumed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why withdrawal headaches are so painful remains somewhat unclear. Because caffeine affects many parts of the body, experts haven't been able to pin down a single overarching cause. But the pain likely comes, in part, from dilated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f2e9421c-28e6-4477-9f0f-ea482efeb276"&gt;Caffeine constricts blood vessels — which is part of the reason why the drug can also, paradoxically, be used to relieve some types of headaches, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When caffeine use stops, those blood vessels swell, causing more blood flow and, therefore, pain. But &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13897/brian-mcgeeney-neurology-boston-jamaica_plain" target="_blank" data-url="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13897/brian-mcgeeney-neurology-boston-jamaica_plain" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Brian McGeeney&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and headache specialist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, said that's just one contributing cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's involved, but it's not the whole story," he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/does-caffeine-help-or-cause-headaches" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/does-caffeine-help-or-cause-headaches"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does caffeine help or cause headaches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation for caffeine withdrawal headaches has to do with adenosine receptors. The drug blocks adenosine, a building block of RNA, from attaching to receptors scattered across the central nervous system. This causes neurons to fire more quickly and blood vessels to constrict, which, in turn, makes people feel more alert and awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone stops consuming caffeine, the sudden buildup of adenosine in the body can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/3/30" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/3/30" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;contribute to withdrawal headaches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is also why caffeine is commonly used to treat headaches: By blocking adenosine receptors, it prevents blood vessel dilation from the outset. In fact, caffeine can make painkillers like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42205-ibuprofen.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42205-ibuprofen.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42785-acetaminophen.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42785-acetaminophen.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; work more efficiently, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=Also%2C%20when%20caffeine%20is%20taken,medication%20to%20provide%20faster%20relief." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=Also%2C%20when%20caffeine%20is%20taken,medication%20to%20provide%20faster%20relief." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as Pearson noted, much of caffeine withdrawal is yet to be explained. "We certainly don't know, but these are all reasons why it might be causing headaches," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine withdrawal often &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;happens in hospital settings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when patients have to quit their coffee habit to undergo a medical procedure. Some studies also show caffeine withdrawal symptoms in people who fast, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as Muslims observing Ramadan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When life is interrupted unpredictably, like you end up in the emergency room or get admitted to hospital, you see a lot of caffeine withdrawal," McGeeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="14e124de-9b23-4a64-bee2-5ef125afdd98"&gt;Caffeine is usually &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;safe in moderation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But when someone is looking to reduce or eliminate their caffeine intake, experts agree that the best strategy is to cut down gradually. Drink a little less each day, or substitute lower-caffeine alternatives, like tea, to make the transition easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If somebody's using caffeine chronically and they want to cut back, I would do it quite gradually," Pearson said. "So no faster than about 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine reduced per day — that's a quarter to half a cup of coffee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a headache lasts longer than a week, Pearson recommended seeking medical care, as that time frame suggests the headache may be triggered by something other than caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Gqdx774KcPGQZTxVgY7G3n-9FCA4TIhP6d0IDjtS129ixg77mOhVGIk" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Gqdx774KcPGQZTxVgY7G3n-9FCA4TIhP6d0IDjtS129ixg77mOhVGIk slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In human tissue, lithium levels drop at the earliest stages, and in mice, forming amyloid appears to sequester lithium; a brain-available, amyloid-evading lithium compound restored memory and reversed pathology. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study finds that lithium loss triggers &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Alzheimer’s&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Alzheimer&amp;amp;#039;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia. The disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and communication. There is currently no cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt;, but a lithium-based compound reverses the disease in mice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets off the earliest chain of events that leads to Alzheimer’s disease? And why do some people who show Alzheimer’s-like brain changes never progress to dementia? These unresolved questions have challenged scientists for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard Medical School now believe they may have an explanation: a deficiency of lithium in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their study, published on August 6 in Nature, demonstrates for the first time that lithium is naturally present in the brain, where it protects against neurodegeneration and supports the normal functioning of all major brain cell types. The findings — a decade in the making — draw on mouse experiments as well as analyses of human brain tissue and blood samples from people at different stages of cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490370" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490370" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-777x398.jpg" alt="Lithium Deficiency vs. Normal Lithium Levels" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-777x398.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-400x205.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-768x393.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-150x77.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-450x230.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490370" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Top row: In a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, lithium deficiency (right) dramatically increased amyloid beta deposits in the brain compared with mice that had normal physiological levels of lithium (left). Bottom row: The same was true for the Alzheimer’s neurofibrillary tangle protein tau. Credit: Yankner Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that loss of lithium in the human brain is among the earliest alterations linked to Alzheimer’s, while in mice, reduced lithium sped up both brain damage and memory decline. They traced this decline to lithium binding with amyloid plaques and reduced absorption in the brain. In follow-up experiments, they showed that a new lithium compound resistant to amyloid capture restored memory in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the results bring coherence to decades of patient observations and introduce a new framework for understanding the disease, offering potential paths for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Filling gaps in Alzheimer’s research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, which affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, is marked by a range of brain abnormalities. These include clumps of the protein amyloid beta, tangles of the protein tau, and the loss of a protective protein called REST. Yet none of these features fully account for the disease. Some individuals with such changes show no cognitive impairment, and drugs designed to target amyloid beta often fail to restore memory and provide only limited slowing of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also well established that both genetic and environmental influences shape a person’s risk, but researchers have long struggled to explain why people with the same risk factors can experience such different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study suggests that lithium may represent a missing link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer’s disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,” said senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate that amyloid beta is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Yankner, the findings open the possibility that lithium could eventually be used to treat the disease as a whole rather than targeting only one aspect, such as amyloid beta or tau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amyloid beta binds lithium&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key finding from the study is that during the early stages of dementia, amyloid beta begins forming deposits that bind to lithium in both humans and mouse models. This binding reduces lithium’s availability in the brain, lowering its function across all major brain cell types. In mice, the drop in lithium levels triggered changes that mirrored Alzheimer’s disease, including memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified a group of lithium compounds capable of avoiding capture by amyloid beta. Among them, lithium orotate proved the most effective: in mice, it reversed Alzheimer’s-like pathology, protected brain cells from damage, and restored memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these results must still be validated in humans through clinical trials, they suggest that monitoring lithium levels could help detect Alzheimer’s at an early stage. They also highlight the potential of amyloid-resistant lithium compounds as candidates for treatment or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Yankner Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-based drugs are already prescribed for conditions such as bipolar disorder and major depression, but those therapies require doses high enough to be toxic, particularly in older adults. In contrast, Yankner’s team showed that lithium orotate works at a concentration about one-thousandth of the clinical dose — enough to replicate natural brain lithium levels. Mice given this compound for nearly their entire lifespan showed no signs of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial,” Yankner said. “But so far the results are very encouraging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lithium depletion is an early sign of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner’s interest in lithium began while studying its relationship to REST, a protein known for its neuroprotective role. Determining whether lithium naturally exists in the human brain, and whether its levels shift during the progression of neurodegeneration, required access to brain tissue — something not possible to obtain from living individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, the lab partnered with the Rush Memory and Aging Project in Chicago, which maintains a collection of postmortem brain samples donated by thousands of participants spanning the full spectrum of cognitive health and decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This breadth of material was essential. Studying advanced Alzheimer’s is, as Yankner described it, “like looking at a battlefield after a war,” where extensive damage obscures the origins of the disease. In contrast, examining early stages allows researchers to find “important clues before the brain is badly damaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of first author Liviu Aron, senior research associate in the Yankner Lab, the team used advanced mass spectroscopy to measure trace levels of about 30 metals in brain and blood samples from individuals who were cognitively healthy, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with advanced Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490367" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490367" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-777x398.jpg" alt="Comparison of Amyloid and Tau in Treated Mice" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-777x398.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-400x205.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-768x393.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-150x77.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-450x230.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490367" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Treating mice with the amyloid-evading lithium orotate (top row) reduced amyloid beta (left) and tau (right) much more effectively than lithium carbonate (bottom row). Credit: Yankner Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium was the only metal that showed clear differences among groups and declined at the earliest stages of memory loss. Healthy donors had higher lithium levels, while those with mild impairment or full Alzheimer’s exhibited substantially reduced levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team confirmed these results with additional samples from brain banks across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation aligned with earlier population studies that linked higher environmental lithium — such as lithium naturally occurring in drinking water — with lower rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, the new research went further by directly detecting lithium in the brains of individuals who had never received it as a therapy, establishing a normal physiological range and showing that lithium is vital for brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C,” Yankner said. “It’s the first time anyone’s shown that lithium exists at a natural level that’s biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Yankner and colleagues took things a step further. They demonstrated in mice that lithium depletion isn’t merely linked to Alzheimer’s disease — it helps drive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Loss of lithium causes the range of Alzheimer’s-related changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that feeding healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet brought their brain lithium levels down to a level similar to that in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. This appeared to accelerate the aging process, giving rise to brain inflammation, loss of synaptic connections between neurons, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer’s mouse models, depleted lithium dramatically accelerated the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and structures that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium depletion also activated inflammatory cells in the brain called microglia, impairing their ability to degrade amyloid; caused the loss of synapses, axons, and neuron-protecting myelin; and accelerated cognitive decline and memory loss — all hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mouse experiments further revealed that lithium altered the activity of genes known to raise or lower risk of Alzheimer’s, including the most well-known, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replenishing lithium by giving the mice lithium orotate in their water reversed the disease-related damage and restored memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease. Notably, maintaining stable lithium levels in early life prevented Alzheimer’s onset — a finding that confirmed that lithium fuels the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What impresses me the most about lithium is the widespread effect it has on the various manifestations of Alzheimer’s. I really have not seen anything quite like it all my years of working on this disease,” said Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A promising avenue for Alzheimer’s treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few limited clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer’s disease have shown some efficacy, but the lithium compounds they used — such as the clinical standard, lithium carbonate — can be toxic to aging people at the high doses normally used in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research explains why: Amyloid beta was sequestering these other lithium compounds before they could work. Yankner and colleagues found lithium orotate by developing a screening platform that searches a library of compounds for those that might bypass amyloid beta. Other researchers can now use the platform to seek additional amyloid-evading lithium compounds that might be even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most galvanizing findings for us was that there were profound effects at this exquisitely low dose,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If replicated in further studies, the researchers say lithium screening through routine blood tests may one day may offer a way to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s who would benefit from treatment to prevent or delay disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying lithium levels in people who are resistant to Alzheimer’s as they age might help scientists establish a target level that they could help patients maintain to prevent onset of the disease, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since lithium has not yet been shown to be safe or effective in protecting against neurodegeneration in humans, Yankner emphasizes that people should not take lithium compounds on their own. But he expressed cautious optimism that lithium orotate or a similar compound will move forward into clinical trials in the near future and could ultimately change the story of Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients’ lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

"There are some people who will be at the gym for two, three hours. For me, I'm getting in and out of there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong tells his patients to find a physical activity they enjoy and to start by doing it twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His "anything's better than nothing" approach to exercise reflects the findings of a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/15/979" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;large 2023 study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the British Journal of Medicine Sports. The systematic review looked at self-reported data from more than 30 million people and found that those who exercised an average of 2.5 hours a week had a lower risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer than their sedentary peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who exercised up to 2.5 hours longer than the average gained even more health benefits. But even working out for an hour and 15 minutes — half the recommended time of 2.5 hours — lowered the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, compared with no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8" data-toc-id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong doesn't believe in taking stacks of buzzy supplements, but said they can be useful for people with certain deficiencies or health conditions.

            &lt;p&gt;To keep his mind sharp, for an hour or two each day, Hong makes sure he does something that challenges his brain. "Your brain's like a muscle — if you don't use it, you lose it" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, work will be enough stimulation for him, but on the weekends, for example, he might play a game of chess or checkers with his kids, or read. Screentime doesn't count, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental stimulation can't prevent the brain from aging, but evidence suggests it can help build resilience against &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's disease symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as forgetfulness. This resilience is known as cognitive reserve, and studies have found that people with larger reserves, which are built through cognitive activity, developed Alzheimer's disease later in life and had fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important thing I tell all my patients is age is really a number," Hong said. "Your body may tell you you're 52 years old, but you can behave or you can feel like a 35-year-old. And it can also be the other way around."&lt;/p&gt;

Some studies have previously suggested anthocyanins can help combat dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a new study from researchers at the &lt;a href="/topic/university-of-kent"&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;, has said the most effective way to use cherries to boost anthocyanins is not to juice them, but instead to turn them into a powder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cherries that otherwise would have been discarded, researchers analysed cherry juice, pulp and pomace’s retention of anthocyanin. They found “greater biological activity” in developing the powder, which they suggested may bring more health benefits than extracts or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gofEvQ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Scientists took cherries that otherwise would have been thrown out (Place UK/ PA)" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18800"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Scientists took cherries that otherwise would have been thrown out (Place UK/ PA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/biosciences/people/2081/ezcurra-marina"&gt;Dr Marina Ezcurra&lt;/a&gt;, the project’s lead researcher based in Kent’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/school-of-natural-sciences"&gt;School of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, said: ‘Working with local growers has been key to this success. Together we are showing that agricultural by-products don’t need to go to waste – they can become part of the solution to producing sustainable and accessible healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Our newly discovered innovation is a scientific approach that could be adopted at scale in Kent and other agricultural regions, and we look forward to carrying out further research to help drive this forward.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sarah Blackburn, first author of the study, said the research showed how food waste could be turned into health supplements: “What makes this work exciting is that we combined detailed analytical approaches with health measurements in inexpensive laboratory models that provide insights into human health,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allows us to demonstrate the potential of food waste to provide benefits for both people and the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one million people are living with dementia in the UK - a number that is expected to rise significantly to around 1.4 million by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that people who consume more foods rich in flavonoids, such as berries, tea, red wine and dark chocolate, could lower their risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="/health-and-wellbeing/demntia-cure-red-wine-chocolate-b2614396.html"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; from teams at Queen’s University Belfast found increasing your intake of flavonoid-rich foods and drinks could help reduce the risk of developing the incurable illness by 28 per cent. Flavonoids are understood to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that can boost your chances against dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxONzcyWk5BX0hXS2xrT3RiRDE0aFlDNURSZGRmQVhXT05seHVraC11WTF6TjJ0STJhUWNVZldZQmlzMGFFZDdEbG9KRXVsTjBsM0hjYmY3bU1FUlN2aFdVb0pvVXpRanVpQ24wVHFLQjNlUUVXY3BJYmcxN2NJSlg2d2xCd3pPazllNlZqSnl1OFNXY2ZmckJ5dFFlQjVTQ0RtWjhPR2RJUlFvdlZzd1V1ZA</guid></item><item><title>父亲希望能治愈影响其他300人的儿子罕见病--英国广播公司</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5URHQxcXZxdHlZTG9waWhxeUhxV091Zy1RT2plYWxNQm1xb3BnNm1VWXFOa1hoaXBUTGhta1B6Sm1zLXpYcUZRaXk5cjAyRFV5X0RFVkJ3ZHlCQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBmYXVjQzctN0N3cjVlaXRJWXYyNENJVXhoZ2NLci1MWDVnZW85RjREX3lrc3p1dTA0NlNKTnlHeTcydmdhNlktclBjSWFhZ0c0Sm9EWUtIWUpxZjR6bnNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Dad's hope to find cure for son's rare condition&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 bwIYVa"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;James McCarthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, West of England&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Clara Bullock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Somerset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Supplied by family Tom is holding is son Jenson in his arms, their faces are touching and they are both smiling at the camera." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Supplied by family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Tom hopes a cure or life-changing therapies can be found for his son Jenson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A father whose son has been diagnosed with a condition only 300 people have in the world has launched a mission to find a "cure or life-changing therapy". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Within days of Jenson's birth he collapsed and was not expected to live.

In 2017, around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7310804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;462 million people&lt;/a&gt;, or 6.28% of the world’s population lived with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2024, the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="World Health Organization" rationale="Highly respected international organization"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-11-2024-urgent-action-needed-as-global-diabetes-cases-increase-four-fold-over-past-decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; reported that the number of people living with diabetes worldwide had risen to more than 800 million, of whom 95% had type 2 diabetes. And the condition can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, vision problems and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity and overweight are common in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and losing weight can help manage symptoms, or even &lt;a href="https://bmjgroup.com/losing-weight-can-reverse-type-2-diabetes-but-is-rarely-achieved-or-recorded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;reverse the condition&lt;/a&gt; in some. Now, a study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405#faq" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;turmeric or curcumin&lt;/a&gt; supplements might help people with these conditions on their weight-loss journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review of 20 randomized controlled trials, published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-025-00386-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, found that turmeric or curcumin — the active component of turmeric — had a beneficial effect on some indicators of obesity, and might therefore help with weight management in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M.

From a scientific standpoint, these changes, about 2 kg (5 lbs) of weight loss and [approximately] 2–3 cm (about an inch) off the waist, may seem small, but in population health even minor improvements in central obesity can reduce metabolic and cardiovascular risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric has long been used to add flavor and color to foods, and can also be taken as a supplement. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9881416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it may have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, and that it is generally &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405#adverse-effects" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;safe and well tolerated&lt;/a&gt; at the dosages found in food, although may have some side effects at higher dosages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest review investigated the effects of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on measures of body size, including body weight, &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Heart Lung and Blood Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, percentage of fat mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and hip circumference, in 20 different studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All were randomized controlled trials comparing supplementation with placebo, carried out in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the studies were given dosages ranging from 80 milligrams per day (mg/day) to 2,100 mg/day, for 8– 36 weeks. The researchers noted that adverse events, such as stomachache, itching, vertigo, constipation, hot flashes, and nausea, were reported in only 3 of the 20 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with type 2 diabetes, turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to improvements in body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and hip circumference, but not BMI or waist-to-hip ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those with prediabetes, supplements significantly reduced body weight and waist circumference, but again had no effect on BMI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found significant associations between dosage and waist circumference, and between duration of supplementation and body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the study authors, &lt;a href="https://cv.tums.ac.ir/en/cv/Leila_Azadbakht" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Leila Azadbakht&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor of nutritional Sciences, and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammadreza-Baniasadi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mohammadreza Moradi Baniasadi&lt;/a&gt;, MSc in the Department of Community Nutrition at the School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, both at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, commented on their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that “the most useful finding is the dose-response relationship: Supplementation for [more than] 22 weeks significantly reduced body weight —[weighted mean difference of] -2.5 kg — and doses [of more than] 15,00 mg/day lowered waist circumference — [weighted mean difference of] -1.8 cm — in [type 2 diabetes] patients.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides practical guidance for clinicians on optimal dosing and duration to achieve meaningful effects, highlighting the potential of turmeric/curcumin as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions for weight control in diabetes management,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pure.atu.ie/en/persons/eamon-laird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eamon Laird&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, assistant lecturer in Human Nutrition at Atlantic Technological University Sligo, and adjunct assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, not involved in the study explained for &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Turmeric/curcumin could influence metabolism, reducing inflammation, and potentially impacting (reducing) appetite. Some studies suggest curcumin can enhance thermogenesis (calorie burning for heat production), which could contribute to weight loss over time. Additionally, curcumin’s anti-inflammatory properties may help counteract some of the inflammation (cytokines) associated with obesity and diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-turmeric-help-you-lose-weight#research" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that turmeric may help with weight loss, but there is little clear evidence as to how it has its effects, as Azadbakht and Baniasadi told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While the precise mechanism remains somewhat enigmatic, we believe the activation of &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;AMPK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; and the anti-inflammatory properties are the most likely primary modes, as they directly link to improved insulin sensitivity, reduced chronic inflammation — common in [type 2 diabetes] and prediabetes‚ and enhanced fat metabolism,” the study authors explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laird welcomed the study as interesting but highlighted “significant limitations to consider before getting too excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firstly,” he told &lt;em&gt;MNT,&lt;/em&gt; “out of the 20 studies in the analysis 13 are from the same country (Iran). This limits the potential effects/applicability to the general public as there could be just something unique about that population whether it be genetics or just other dietary or other components not controlled for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there was a wide range of doses and forms of the product used, wide variations in the study duration whilst the majority of the studies were in mostly older female adults,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azadbakht and Baniasadi outlined how they hope to address these issues, noting: “We are considering further research to address limitations in the current evidence base. This includes larger, longer-term [&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280574" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt;] focusing on high-absorption formulations and combinations with lifestyle interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to explore effects in diverse populations (e.g. varying ethnicities or comorbidities) and investigate mechanistic pathways more deeply […] to better predict responders and optimize safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research is encouraging, but we need to be cautious. The overall effect sizes are small, and the certainty of evidence is low to moderate, meaning stronger, larger trials are still needed. […] For patients, the takeaway is that turmeric can be a helpful addition to a healthy lifestyle, but it’s not a shortcut to weight loss. Clinicians should frame it as a ‘supportive therapy’ alongside established treatments, like lifestyle and medications, for diabetes and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Thomas M.

Nausea relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019938/"&gt;Multiple clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown consistent evidence that ginger can reduce nausea and vomiting, particularly when compared to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/feeling-sick-nausea/"&gt;NHS even recommends&lt;/a&gt; ginger-containing foods or teas for easing nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger seems especially effective for nausea during pregnancy. In small doses, it's considered a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131535/"&gt;safe and effective option&lt;/a&gt; for people who don't respond well to standard anti-nausea treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also promising evidence that ginger can help with chemotherapy-induced nausea, though &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;results are mixed&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to motion sickness and post-surgery nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger's anti-nausea effects may work by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;blocking serotonin receptors&lt;/a&gt; and acting on both the gut and brain. It may also help by reducing gas and bloating in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is rich in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, such as gingerol and shogaol, which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests ginger supplements may help regulate inflammation, especially in autoimmune conditions. &lt;a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/172011"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that ginger reduced the activity of neutrophils – white blood cells that often become overactive in diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and antiphospholipid syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6874304/"&gt;extracellular traps&lt;/a&gt; (NETs), which are web-like structures used to trap and kill pathogens. But when NETs form excessively, they can fuel autoimmune diseases. In the study, taking ginger daily for one week significantly reduced NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study used ginger supplements, it's unclear whether fresh ginger or tea has the same effect. Still, the findings suggest ginger may be a helpful, natural option for people with certain autoimmune conditions – though more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger also has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2019.1573829#:%7E:text=Results%20indicate%20that%20ginger%20contains,interesting%20alternative%20to%20synthetic%20antimicrobials."&gt;antimicrobial properties&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can help combat bacteria,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and other harmful microbes. Combined with its anti-inflammatory effects, this makes ginger a popular remedy for easing cold and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; symptoms like sore throats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Pain management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pain, the research on ginger is encouraging – though not conclusive. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3665023/#ref10"&gt;Some studies show&lt;/a&gt; that ginger extract can reduce knee pain and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis, especially during the early stages of treatment. However, results vary, and not everyone experiences the same level of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For muscle pain, &lt;a href="https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(09)00915-8/fulltext"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; that taking two grams of ginger daily for 11 days reduced soreness after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger may also ease menstrual pain. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455918302304"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; its effectiveness rivals that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger works by &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;activating pathways&lt;/a&gt; in the nervous system that dampen pain signals. It may also inhibit inflammatory chemicals like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Heart health and diabetes support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, high blood sugar and elevated "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL cholesterol) are all risk factors for heart disease. Ginger may help with all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36165525/"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; of 26  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ginger supplementation can significantly improve cholesterol levels — lowering triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, while raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. It may also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972845/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, ginger could offer additional benefits. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5692962"&gt;review of ten studies&lt;/a&gt; found that taking one to three grams of ginger daily for four to 12 weeks helped improve both cholesterol levels and blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits appear to come from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519348/#:%7E:text=Abstract,also%20discussed%20in%20this%20update."&gt;multiple mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, including improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced glucose uptake in cells, and reduced oxidative stress. Ginger's anti-inflammatory actions may also contribute to its heart-protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809190/"&gt;early research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-sex"&gt;benefits for sexual health&lt;/a&gt;, though evidence in humans is still limited. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316093/"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that ginger can boost testosterone levels, improve blood flow, and enhance sexual behaviour. In traditional medicine systems, it has long been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4377061/"&gt;used as an aphrodisiac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's not yet strong clinical evidence to confirm a direct impact on libido, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12007927/"&gt;ginger's anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, circulatory and hormonal effects could play a supportive role, particularly for people managing conditions like diabetes or oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Brain health and cancer research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8971783/"&gt;neuroprotective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;anti-cancer&lt;/a&gt; benefits. Lab-based studies show that ginger compounds can help protect brain cells from oxidative damage – a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other in-vitro research has found that ginger can slow the growth of some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells. However, these findings are still in early stages and more research is needed to confirm their relevance in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is generally safe when consumed in food or tea. But like any supplement, it should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170653" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg" alt="ginger tea" class="wp-image-170653 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ginger is safe to drink in moderation as a tea.

These are usually mild and temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/"&gt;Certain groups&lt;/a&gt; should use caution with high doses. Ginger may increase bleeding risk in people on blood thinners (like warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel), and it can enhance the effects of diabetes or blood pressure medications, potentially leading to low blood sugar or blood pressure. Pregnant women should also consult a doctor before using high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ginger isn't just a fragrant kitchen spice – it's a natural remedy with growing scientific support. For most people, enjoying ginger in food or tea is a safe and effective way to tap into its therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering taking supplements, it's always best to speak with your doctor or pharmacist first, especially if you're managing a medical condition or taking medication.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261506/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors soon discovered they were infected with the rare soil bacterium, which causes a disease called melioidosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous infection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose and tricky to treat, as it is naturally resistant to some antibiotics. It can infect people if they breathe it in or get it into open cuts. Sometimes the infection can stay localized, like a lung infection or a skin ulcer. But it can also get into the blood and become a systemic infection, spreading to various organs, including the brain. Fatality rates can be as high as 90 percent in people who are not treated but fall to less than 40 percent in people who receive prompt, proper care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men in 2024 were quickly hospitalized and diagnosed with sepsis. Both were treated with heavy antibiotic regimens and recovered, though patient 2 relapsed in November, requiring another hospital stay. He ultimately recovered again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, about a dozen melioidosis cases are identified each year in the US on average, but most occur in people who have traveled to areas known to harbor the bacterium. Neither of the men infected last year had recently traveled to any such places. So the researchers turned to genetic sequencing, which revealed the link to two cases in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those cases, both men died from the infection. The man dubbed Patient 3 died in October of 1989. He was a veteran who fought in Vietnam—where the bacterium is endemic—two decades prior to his infection. The researchers note that such a long latency period for a &lt;em&gt;B. pseudomallei&lt;/em&gt; infection is not entirely out of the question, but it would be rare to have such a large gap between an exposure and an infection. More suspiciously, the researchers note that in the month prior to Patient 3's death, Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Georgia as a Category 4 storm, dumping three to five inches of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

Her grandmother died of complications from RA, and in the last few months of her life, it was Smith who served as her caregiver, administering doses of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/medication-topics/understanding-methotrexate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:methotrexate;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt; to treat her pain and inflammation. The drug, a form of chemotherapy also used to treat cancer, is so potent that Smith had to wear gloves to safely give it to her grandmother. So, when Smith’s doctor told her she too would probably have to take methotrexate long-term, her heart sank. “That was so scary for me,” she tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smith’s RA and weight — 311 pounds — were “double negatives” against her health, her doctor said. She &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;to lose the weight. And so Smith started following the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, losing 5 or 6 pounds in the process. But that wasn’t nearly enough to alleviate the excessive inflammation and pain in her joints during flare-ups, which could last as long as four months. Smith was in constant pain. Some days, she couldn’t go to work. Other times, she was physically incapable of playing with her 4-year-old daughter. “It was stress on top of stress, and those are some of the main triggers of a flare,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;GLP-1 weight loss medications haven’t been approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. But they’ve &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4823510/#:~:text=It%20was%20reported%20that%20GLP,on%20its%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20actions." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. While Smith’s insurance wouldn’t cover the medication (deeming it for “cosmetic weight loss”), she got a prescription for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/millions-of-people-are-taking-compounded-weight-loss-drugs-now-theyre-about-to-disappear-202621562.html" data-ylk="slk:compounded semaglutide;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;compounded semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; from a local provider and, later, compounded tirzepatide from an online provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seven months later, Smith, 30, hasn’t had a single arthritis flare-up. “I’ve been able to come off my rheumatoid arthritis medicines — and these are medications that people &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;come off of,” she says. It’s the biggest way that Smith’s life has changed since starting a GLP-1, but far from the only shift. For this installment of the Yahoo series &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tagged/on-my-weigh/" data-ylk="slk:On My Weigh;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On My Weigh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Smith explains in her own words how the medication has helped her teach her daughter healthy eating habits and given her the clarity she needed to leave the teaching job that had burned her out. “Since being on a GLP-1, I put myself and my mental and physical health first,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Smith has lost nearly 70 pounds since starting tirzepatide.

She was missing out, and I just wanted to change that and be able to play with her. And I wanted to get off of methotrexate, the potent medication I was taking for my rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress report: &lt;/strong&gt;I feel amazing. My inflammation levels are down, I’m happier and I haven’t had a single arthritis flare-up since I’ve been on tirzepatide. I’m full of energy, I’m back to loving going out and dressing up — I just see myself. I’ve lost 69 pounds in seven months, and the other day I was able to put a towel all the way around me to cover up. I don’t think I’d been able to do that since high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food noise volume: &lt;/strong&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, my food noise was an 8 out of 10. Until recently, I was a full-time schoolteacher, plus I’m a full-time mom and girlfriend to a full-time musician. Staying busy kept my food noise at bay. But when I did want to eat, I wanted to eat the wrong way. Now that I’m on a GLP-1, I can’t say my food noise is completely gone. But it’s at about a 3, and when I do have cravings, it’s for taco salad, or soup or broccoli. It’s very weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="day-in-the-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day in the life &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="rise-and-shine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise and shine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to my GLP-1 journey, I woke up in pain every morning. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could physically get up and move out of bed. I was so angry at my body. I felt like I was too young to be waking up in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I just jump up. I wake up at 5:15 a.m., go to the bathroom and jump on the scale. Then I tell my social media followers, “Good morning, this is going to be a good day.” I get my daughter up at about 6:30 a.m. I’m happy, and I go into her room refreshed because I’ve gotten a good night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="first-bites"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I used to have a bacon, egg and cheese croissant, hash browns and a large iced coffee from Burger King or McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I might get similar things when I eat breakfast out, but I no longer get full combo meals. I don’t drink coffee or sodas. I just have hydration packets in my water that I bring from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At home, I make eggs with some kind of meat or protein. Sometimes I’ll still have a croissant, but I purchase them from Sam’s Club now. They have fewer calories and 16 grams of protein. Even though I’m not always cooking, what I’m eating is better-quality food. And I make sure I’m always getting protein with breakfast. I’m setting myself up for success with that first bite, rather than eating those potatoes and iced coffee that are going to have me crashing by 12 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="get-ready-with-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready with me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before, everything I wore was very dark. We all know that black covers up everything. I would just throw on some sweatpants or joggers and just go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I actually care what I look like. I wake up earlier, because I want to have time to choose colors that I feel good and comfortable in. I like to wear a lot of different patterns. Prior to my major weight gain, I used to be a girl who loved heels. I’m slowly getting back into heels and jewelry, because I feel beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="make-a-move"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For about four years, before I started my GLP-1 journey, I had a gym membership that I never used. Now I know that gym life just isn’t for me. I’ll go every now and again, but it’s not a long-term solution because it’s not something that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But now I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; in a season where I want to do things that I enjoy &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are good for me. Since starting my GLP-1, I’ve canceled my gym membership. Instead, I’ve been trying to incorporate things that I can maintain into my day-to-day routine — things like taking daily walks with my daughter and going to the park and playing with her. I have weights, a squat machine, a sit-up machine and a foldable elliptical all at home. When I feel like it, I go downstairs and work out. But I don’t want to put myself back in a position where I’m doing things just because people say I should. I want to be the captain of my own boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dose-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dose time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m actually on a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peptide-stacking-latest-viral-wellness-162349352.html" data-ylk="slk:whole peptide stack;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;whole peptide stack&lt;/a&gt;, which is a set of several injections my doctor prescribed to help optimize my health. So, every Monday, I take my tirzepatide, Lipo-C [an amino acid and vitamin injection that is &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/using-fat-dissolving-injections-are-not-fda-approved-can-be-harmful" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not approved by the Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;not approved by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; but has &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3486781/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shown some promise for weight loss in research;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;shown some promise for weight loss in research&lt;/a&gt;] and anti-aging &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/healthy-aging/longevity/articles/nad-does-help-longevity-164617662.html" data-ylk="slk:NAD+;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; injections. Wednesday, I take the NAD+, Friday, I take NAD+ and Lipo-C. I feel like I have a really good stack, and it is prescribed by a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; doctor. I think it helps me to feel like the best version of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I consider Sunday nights my cheat night. I’ll eat something more fatty than usual, like a taco salad (but I’ll actually eat the shell), or I’ll have Olive Garden cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. I try to give my body something to eat the night before I take my medications. My cravings are stronger right before my shot days. But I’ve been able to train myself to be disciplined while having grace for myself and understand that it’s OK to eat things that you enjoy. Plus, now I crave things that I love &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is more active — and wearing bright colors — since starting a GLP-1. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Getty, courtesy of Cassandra Smith)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-do-lunch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s do lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My pre-GLP-1 lunch was a burger, some fried chicken nuggets, hot wings — anything fried, that was quick to grab-and-go or pick up from the drive-through. Cooking was just never my concern back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I actually take the time to cook instead, because I’ve realized that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A typical lunch these days is whatever I didn’t eat the night before for dinner. We all know that those of us on GLP-1s don’t eat as much and we always have leftovers. So, I’ve learned to love them. I never used to eat them, because I was going to fast food restaurants a lot — and who wants to eat McDonald’s the next day? Every now and then I’ll splurge and get some sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="happy-hour"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy hour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, I didn’t really feel like I had free time. I spent a lot of it sleeping. I felt mentally drained from dealing with kids all day (much as I love them) and crashing from what I ate. I would get home and just sleep. I called it hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I feel like I have more time — and did even before I quit my job. I enjoy going to Ulta and looking at new skin care, or going window-shopping at TJ Maxx. I know I’m still transitioning sizes, so I restrain myself from buying too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any time spent with my child is quality time for me. But now it’s actually quality time for &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; She doesn’t have to just sit in bed and watch TV because that’s all I physically can do. We’re going to the park, we go on nature walks, we go to my parents’ house in the middle of the week because I have the energy to drive there, instead of being too drained because I ate potatoes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quantity of time with her hasn’t changed, but the quality of it has changed drastically. It’s more intentional, and she gains more out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dinner-bell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I never had enough time in the day to really focus on what to eat before my GLP-1 journey. It was just, &lt;em&gt;Throw it in the microwave, throw it in the oven. &lt;/em&gt;When I went out for dinner,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I used to love to get steak. But when I found out that I had rheumatoid arthritis, steak would cause me to flare. So I stopped eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, my go-to protein is salmon, with a veggie, and they’re both cooked in my house. As soon as I began taking tirzepatide, I started to make sure protein was in every single thing I was eating. That first month or so, I tracked everything. But I learned how much protein and how many calories were in the things I was eating — as people on GLP-1s, we eat the same things over and over — and it just became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My doctor taught me to stay on the outside aisles of the store when I go to the grocery store. As long as you stay on those walls, you’re eating fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats and fresh eggs. If you’re buying food from the center of the store, the more sodium and calories you’re getting in those processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a 4-year-old daughter, it’s so exciting for me to be able to raise her in a way that I wish I had been raised. Cooking is a whole activity for us, and for her, cooking healthy food will be normal. I get to create that generational knowledge with my daughter and save her from having to be on a GLP-1 later, because she has had the opportunity to learn to eat the right things from the beginning. She asks if we’re having salmon and broccoli for dinner. Today, my sister picked my daughter and my nephew up and they went to McDonald’s. My daughter didn’t want anything. She understands, at 4 years old, that we don’t eat that. My mom makes treats for major events, and sometimes she’ll eat some of the extras. My daughter will be like, “Grandma, you shouldn’t eat that!” My mom says, “Get this little girl, she’s doing too much!” But I love it. I know that, even when I’m not present, the things I taught her still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-get-the-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get the bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before I started taking tirzepatide, I was spending a lot of money eating out every day with my daughter. At Chick-fil-A, we were spending $25 on one meal. It added up to about $800 a month. And on top of that was the junk I was buying at the grocery store to stock up the house. It probably totaled about $1,200 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, Shed, my provider, has really good prices for GLP-1s. I spend about $300 a month on my medications. Ultimately, I’m saving money. My budget is better, and I’m able to invest more and help the people around me more because I’m not going out every day spending money on food. The bill is amazing. I love the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:27:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQM0dDWnh2MFM0aEdxVG1ua3dNa1JfWldLd2lkcWh1SEVQeUdQNVY3cjBjS1YwLWwtT3EtQ2UyNERrZFczcVZ5TTlRQ1dibWhtQjZfcjNoQ3NiVG5nazZqMVk1U1FqVTRpczBUaHVhUVhiSkswTUh1LWVqZHJQS2gxQUxvTjJ6ekVtNk9MTkpVbVhmMmJPUFpqNnNvOTE5TklMSGFqdC1mNndLNzVuSzNFNWVYb1pyTVNxT0dwbTVOVWRjRFlvc3M4ZmdpMnh3UQ</guid></item><item><title>如何在不用药物的情况下降低血压- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQemc0REZ5R0dSRFdzMktHRFd2NzdCa29zMlRNZEV3UU9RQnl2ZE9LZnZEQnJRbXpkcmZOOHROd21Rcm5SYTdBdUtHVE04ZjdNYzdkUzBhY0o1WGNVcms3YklNWS1SczI0UUpuZ25sbVZTLXY2b0VfVHVieC1odk1DVmN2QmYteldJVDhLRzFsd0dJV1RfTFdN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="video-resource__details--leaf"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a week after Berkeley Unified students and educators went back to school, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyschools.net/2025/08/covid-19-cases-at-a-few-busd-schools-casos-de-covid-19-en-algunas-escuelas-en-busd/"&gt;officials said Thursday that COVID-19 cases have&lt;/a&gt; been documented at “a few” local schools, including at Berkeley High where cases have occurred through contact with sick students. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California is again experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-08-16/covid-surges-nationwide-with-highest-rates-in-california"&gt;an increase in COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt; at the same time students are returning to school. Over the last few years, the virus has shown a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/20/well/why-covid-is-spreading-again-this-summer.html"&gt;tendency to surge in the late summer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUSD spokesperson Trish McDermott said Thursday in an email that two staff members at different schools reported COVID-19 cases since the start of the school year. A few cases were reported at Berkeley High, though some of those who reported having COVID were not infectious while on campus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“(This) message was a reminder that COVID has not gone away,” McDermott said. “Anyone with symptoms should test, and those who test positive should follow public health guidance regarding returning to school/work.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s been more than five years since COVID-19 closed campuses and upended daily life, and school districts have mostly moved on from the types of safety protocols that were implemented during the height of the pandemic. BUSD said in its &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyschools.net/covid-19-safety-information-2025-2026-school-year/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that most of the rules for student and staff safety set forth by the California Department of Health and the Division of Occupational Safety and Health have expired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district has stopped its contact tracing program, which alerted families and staff about close contact with infected individuals, and BUSD will only be required to record COVID-19 cases among staff through next February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUSD advises that staff self-report COVID-19 cases only if the illness was symptomatic and they were infectious while on a campus or at a BUSD facility. Employees can find more information and report a case using &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYc5E8leoxYowbHSb5sgBXjFQHE90on2nLWiDWfvf1elB7Kw/viewform"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district asks students exhibiting common COVID-19 symptoms such as a cough, fever, or runny nose to get tested as soon as possible, and stay home if they are sick. They can return to school once they have not had a fever for 24 hours without the aid of medication, and if other symptoms are “mild and improving,” according to district guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district also recommends that students and staff who test positive mask for five and 10 days, respectively, and follow good hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete BUSD safety plan and COVID-19 guidance for the 2025-2026 school year can be found &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyschools.net/covid-19-safety-information-2025-2026-school-year/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/117060" target="_blank"&gt;recent pediatric COVID-19 vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which differ from those of the CDC, have raised concerns from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who responded with an oblique warning to any physicians who might follow the AAP's advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AAP should ... be candid with doctors and hospitals that recommendations that diverge from the CDC's official list are not shielded from liability under the 1986 Vaccine Injury Act," Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1957914911415153107" target="_blank"&gt;posted this week on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*1hkbqsd*_ga*OTExMTY4NzUwLjE3NTU3OTQ4MzQ.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU4ODkxMDkkbzMkZzAkdDE3NTU4ODkxMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjU1NDAzOTU5LjE3NTU3OTQ4MzQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU4ODkxMDkkbzMkZzAkdDE3NTU4ODkxMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;The AAP recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, released on Tuesday, included a strong endorsement of COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to under 2 years. The group also recommended COVID shots for older children if the parents want to do that. Those recommendations differ from &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/115822" target="_blank"&gt;guidance issued by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, which has said the vaccines are not specifically recommended for children although they can still get them if parents and providers agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Kennedy correct about the liability issue? "As has become common for Secretary Kennedy, this is misleading," Dorit Reiss, PhD, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dorit.reiss/posts/pfbid02WqwdHBfNN82WeFwBSFHrYKgGu8JVLH8wcpTzBnCkVGFiSUSs56ptqgHoVTAeismTl?rdid=GFdlkNAZtmmkImnu" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. "Whether a vaccine falls under VICP [the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the part of the Vaccine Injury Act that deals with liability issues] has nothing to do with whether AAP recommends it, and the liability protections are not removed by this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a vaccine is covered by VICP, liability protections apply to manufacturers and administrators: anyone claiming a vaccine harm from a childhood vaccine that is under VICP has to go through the program first," she said. "ACIP has not actually changed the current recommendations in ways that affect VICP." Furthermore, "COVID-19 vaccines for children are not under VICP, but that's not because of anything AAP did or the secretary, even, did  --  it's because Congress has not yet legislated to create an excise tax for COVID-19 vaccines, and until Congress does that, they're not within VICP."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Kirkland, PhD, JD, professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, agreed with Reiss that the COVID vaccine doesn't fall within the VICP and so is not affected by the CDC's new recommendation. However, "it could hint at future changes if Kennedy plans to withdraw recommendations from other childhood vaccines that are currently covered under the Vaccine Injury Act, which would mean that they no longer meet the statutory definition for coverage in the compensation program," she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This development should not change doctors' willingness to recommend pediatric vaccines, which still have all the safety and compensation protections that they had prior to Kennedy taking office," she added. "There do seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/washington-watch/116707" target="_blank"&gt;changes in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; on the way, though it's hard to know from Kennedy's remarks exactly what he has planned. Removing childhood vaccines from the compensation program could upend vaccine markets and leave the small number of people who suffer an adverse reaction without a plausible path to compensation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her Facebook post, Reiss reminded readers that "in spite of [his] implied threat, Secretary Kennedy would not be bringing any cases" to court related to vaccine injuries. Instead, "parents who think their children were harmed by COVID-19 vaccines are the relevant ones here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Kennedy did want to remove another vaccine from the VICP, she noted, "ACIP would have to completely not recommend it for children and pregnant women" instead of just saying it had to be administered after shared decision making between parents and providers. "And then," she added, "the secretary would have to open a rulemaking process  --  publish the change in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt;, solicit comments, and publish a final decision. And a company making that vaccine, or someone denied a vaccine because of removal of liability protections, could sue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his tweet, Kennedy also called the AAP recommendations "corporate-friendly" and said that "The Trump administration believes in free speech and AAP has a right to make its case to the American people. But AAP should follow the lead of HHS and disclose conflicts of interest, including its corporate entanglements and those of its journal  --  &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;  --  so that Americans may ask whether the AAP's recommendations reflect public health interest, or are, perhaps, just a pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP's Big Pharma benefactors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP fired back. "This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts," AAP President Susan Kressly, MD, said in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;.​ "Our immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation's leading health experts. We are transparent about our funders​, follow rigorous conflict-of-interest disclosures, and maintain safeguards to ensure the integrity and independence of our guidance. We welcome an opportunity to sit down with the secretary to review our recommendations and restore our seat at the table."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last sentence in AAP's statement referred to some changes that Kennedy has made to vaccine policymaking at the CDC. In June, he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/115987" target="_blank"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  --  which advises the CDC on its immunization recommendations  --  and &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/116026" target="_blank"&gt;replaced them with eight people&lt;/a&gt;, including known vaccine skeptics; some of the new members reportedly have their own conflicts of interest related to serving as expert witnesses in legal proceedings targeted at vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the AAP, the American Medical Association, and other healthcare groups &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/116802" target="_blank"&gt;were told at the end of July&lt;/a&gt; that they could no longer participate in ACIP work groups, which convene in between ACIP meetings to develop recommendation options for ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;

However, now that he’s gone, Colleen has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight, and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was the youngest of five children,” Colleen said. “He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother’s shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren’t sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. Scott’s mother fought for her son’s right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School’s very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments according to Colleen. Scott helped write Idaho’s Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight,” said Colleen. “He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;

Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads but something that gave him much pleasure in life. | Courtesy photo &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. “There are so many others who do a much better job,” he would say. “These are just silly little stories anyone could write.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, “Nobody would believe I really did those things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, Scott reluctantly “retired.” That’s when he began writing the “little stories” about his life that grew into two volumes of “Tales from the High Lonesome.” They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;

She plans to combine Scott’s remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott’s books are available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/tales-high-lonesome-scott-hancock/dp/b08gdkghl2"&gt;Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler’s Market in Blackfoot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/06/keslers-gives-local-authors-a-place-to-sell-books/"&gt;RELATED: Kesler’s gives local authors a place to sell books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Colleen emphasizes that writing was just a small part of Scott’s accomplishments and who he was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people,” said Colleen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Colleen, sharing Scott’s legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you,” Colleen concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg" alt="Scott Hancock 1982 article" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-772270" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-860x575.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-748x500.jpg 748w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-600x401.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health said Friday that an adult living in central Maryland has tested positive for West Nile virus, which is the first confirmed human case in the state so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient is currently recovering from the infection. The health department did not confirm which county the person is residing, citing patient confidentiality issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is transmitted to humans through infected mosquitoes that have contracted the disease through birds. In rare cases, the virus can also be spread from person to person through organ donation, blood transfusion or from a pregnant woman to a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge people to be vigilant and take steps to avoid infection, such as eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes can breed,” Deputy Secretary for Public Health Services Dr. Meg Sullivan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 18 Maryland residents tested positive for West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 80% of those infected with the disease do not develop symptoms, but some may experience mild symptoms, such as fever, headache and body aches, as well as skin rashes or swollen lymph lands. Symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus, which mainly affects the nervous system, is often more severe for those over 50 or those with previous health conditions once infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D.C. health officials also recently came across &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/08/dc-health-urges-residents-to-take-precautions-after-several-birds-test-positive-for-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four dead American crows that tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus in Wards 2, 3, 5 and 7. D.C. Health recommended residents to take precautions by wearing long-sleeved clothing and wear EPA-approved mosquito repellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland health department urges people who are concerned about mosquito bites to cover up exposed skin and monitor their yards and gardens for high mosquito activity, especially areas with standing water that can attract the insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department launched a campaign in May to prevent mosquito bites, including a &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yb0rvqfc0ue6fuidlwsg8/AOFoms-9xmKJ4S0GcqBgQ7g?rlkey=v2cvfm5v8oktn1jjxjpekxlkk&amp;amp;st=bghygnnw&amp;amp;dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social media tool kit&lt;/a&gt; to educate Marylanders on protecting themselves and their homes from mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although birds are not routinely tested for West Nile virus in Maryland, sick or injured birds can be reported to an appropriate local wildlife rehabilitator. Residents can call 877-463-6497 for a list of licensed rehabilitators or visit the &lt;a href="https://dnr.maryland.gov/Wildlife/Pages/plants_wildlife/wildlifeproblems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Friday reaffirmed support for Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, becoming the second major professional medical association to break from current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently removed its recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive updated COVID-19 vaccines, ACOG’s recommendations have not changed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank"&gt;updated practice advisory.&lt;/a&gt; “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines in individuals contemplating pregnancy and in pregnant, recently pregnant, and lactating individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00033b6n7el9lp07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines will no longer be among the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended vaccines for pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and healthy children in CDC immunization schedules. The abrupt decision bypassed the government’s normal process for evaluating and recommending vaccines, and Kennedy did not offer scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00043b6ntkupilfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest recommendations from ACOG say that “all clinicians should provide a strong recommendation for updated COVID-19 vaccination to their pregnant and lactating patients.” Vaccinations can occur in any trimester, with an emphasis on the “earliest opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health,” and any of the available Covid-19 vaccines can be delivered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy, includi﻿ng those against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dozens of references in ACOG’s advisory, including multiple CDC sources, emphasize the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy – and the increased risk that pregnant women and infants face from a Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00063b6nfu4bilae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines with explicit support for Covid-19 vaccines for children and a direct criticism of a federal vaccine advisory committee, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that AAP says is made up of “individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation” after it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00073b6nbd5esv9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has also been tension between ACOG and those driving federal health policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6z61o00003b6nw7dxr72s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization said it is no longer accepting federal funding due to recent changes that “significantly impact ACOG’s program goals, policy positions, and ability to provide timely and evidence-based guidance and recommendations for care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen71pbr00023b6neb8hu5fq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿And ACOG &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/acog-to-release-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-other-maternal-immunizations-in-concert-with-the-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July that it was partnering with an independent group of experts called the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/vaccine-information-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop maternal immunization guidance in the absence of “historically robust government-led annual review of data and subsequent evidence-based recommendations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00083b6n45x3mrlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The meeting of the newly reconstructed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) demonstrated that the committee did not follow the longstanding tradition of robust, unbiased review of reputable scientific evidence by medical and public health experts,” ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/acog-asserts-that-data-presented-at-acip-support-maternal-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The data presented to ACIP affirm why ACOG continues to recommend safe, effective maternal vaccination. If ACIP responded to the data as presented in a way that values medical evidence and public health, the government’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy would be restored and support for maternal vaccination would be unwavering.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00093b6nqlqmylw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the abrupt federal changes to the Covid-19 vaccination schedule, dozens of health and medical organizations – including ACOG and AAP – pushed for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen7glcz00073b6oiaq1zcwt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnancy is still listed as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple sources of evidence offering “conclusive increase in risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000a3b6n5tc2dr48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the medical organizations’ letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000b3b6nutie338n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000c3b6n531u43t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond directly on ACOG’s recommendations or the evidence behind them. Instead, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that “HHS and CDC will continue to be the official resource for any guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Friday reaffirmed support for Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, becoming the second major professional medical association to break from current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00023b6nbr204xax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently removed its recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive updated COVID-19 vaccines, ACOG’s recommendations have not changed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank"&gt;updated practice advisory.&lt;/a&gt; “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines in individuals contemplating pregnancy and in pregnant, recently pregnant, and lactating individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00033b6n7el9lp07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines will no longer be among the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended vaccines for pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and healthy children in CDC immunization schedules. The abrupt decision bypassed the government’s normal process for evaluating and recommending vaccines, and Kennedy did not offer scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00043b6ntkupilfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest recommendations from ACOG say that “all clinicians should provide a strong recommendation for updated COVID-19 vaccination to their pregnant and lactating patients.” Vaccinations can occur in any trimester, with an emphasis on the “earliest opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health,” and any of the available Covid-19 vaccines can be delivered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy, includi﻿ng those against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00053b6nug8ai2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of references in ACOG’s advisory, including multiple CDC sources, emphasize the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy – and the increased risk that pregnant women and infants face from a Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00063b6nfu4bilae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines with explicit support for Covid-19 vaccines for children and a direct criticism of a federal vaccine advisory committee, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that AAP says is made up of “individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation” after it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00073b6nbd5esv9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has also been tension between ACOG and those driving federal health policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6z61o00003b6nw7dxr72s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization said it is no longer accepting federal funding due to recent changes that “significantly impact ACOG’s program goals, policy positions, and ability to provide timely and evidence-based guidance and recommendations for care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen71pbr00023b6neb8hu5fq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿And ACOG &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/acog-to-release-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-other-maternal-immunizations-in-concert-with-the-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July that it was partnering with an independent group of experts called the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/vaccine-information-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop maternal immunization guidance in the absence of “historically robust government-led annual review of data and subsequent evidence-based recommendations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00083b6n45x3mrlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The meeting of the newly reconstructed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) demonstrated that the committee did not follow the longstanding tradition of robust, unbiased review of reputable scientific evidence by medical and public health experts,” ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/acog-asserts-that-data-presented-at-acip-support-maternal-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The data presented to ACIP affirm why ACOG continues to recommend safe, effective maternal vaccination. If ACIP responded to the data as presented in a way that values medical evidence and public health, the government’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy would be restored and support for maternal vaccination would be unwavering.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00093b6nqlqmylw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the abrupt federal changes to the Covid-19 vaccination schedule, dozens of health and medical organizations – including ACOG and AAP – pushed for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen7glcz00073b6oiaq1zcwt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnancy is still listed as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple sources of evidence offering “conclusive increase in risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000a3b6n5tc2dr48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the medical organizations’ letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000b3b6nutie338n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n000c3b6n531u43t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond directly on ACOG’s recommendations or the evidence behind them. Instead, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that “HHS and CDC will continue to be the official resource for any guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Some studies have previously suggested anthocyanins can help combat dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a new study from researchers at the &lt;a href="/topic/university-of-kent"&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;, has said the most effective way to use cherries to boost anthocyanins is not to juice them, but instead to turn them into a powder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cherries that otherwise would have been discarded, researchers analysed cherry juice, pulp and pomace’s retention of anthocyanin.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARKERSBURG, W.Va&lt;/strong&gt;. — Land owners across several counties of West Virginia’s Mid-Ohio Valley started to make grim discoveries in the past couple of weeks. Largely in the Parkersburg area people were finding large numbers of dead deer in small groups on their property. The carnage was also reported on the other side of the Ohio River to the Ohio Division of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Virginia Division of Natural Resources wildlife disease specialist Ethan Barton confirmed the culprit was Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease or EHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thus far the disease is confirmed in deer in Ritchie County along with Wood, Jackson, and Pleasants County. We do have a few samples pending in a few other areas too. Across the river, the Ohio Division of Natural Resources has also confirmed cases just on the other side of the river in Washington, Athens, and Meigs County,” said Barton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is not uncommon and is spread by an infected midge. The tiny insect, often called a “noseeum” can quickly infect an entire herd of deer. However, the virus isn’t necessarily a death sentence for the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re very, very small biting flies and essentially it’s a bug virus which causes problems for ruminants of which the whitetail deer is the most susceptible to mortality,” explained Barton. “But some deer will survive infection. It’s a vector borne disease and a deer has to be bitten to contract it and there needs to be sufficient virus in the bite. There are a lot of variables and those who survive are going to be immune to future infection with that same virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of an outbreak can be disturbing. Multiple deer can be dead only yards apart making the damage look quite dramatic. Parkersburg Mayor Tom Joyce noted the city’s crews have removed nine dead deer from yards in the city this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reports started around the beginning of August when the regular rain the state had been experiencing in the spring and through much of the summer gave way to dry conditions. According to Barton, that’s the typical pattern which can lead to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typical conditions you would expect an HD outbreak would be a very wet spring and summer followed by an August that dries out,” said Barton. “If you’ve got a lot of midges then the stage is kind of set,.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the outbreak will be certain when the first frost arrives and kills all of the infected midges which had been spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in January and initially had links to the West Texas outbreak. The state confirmed 87 illnesses linked to the outbreak, 80% of them in children and 90% in people who were not vaccinated. Eight patients were hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials thanked public health, medical, and lab workers who they said worked tirelessly through the outbreak, and they urged the public to keep their guard up against the measles, given multiple ongoing outbreaks in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wisconsin outbreak grows, Pennsylvania warns of exposures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Oconto County Public Health have &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/082225.htm"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; five more measles infections linked to nine earlier cases reported from Oconto County in early August, bringing the total to 14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the ongoing investigation indicates that measles is spreading locally. Oconto County is located in northeastern Wisconsin and is part of the Green Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other measles developments, the Pennsylvania Department of Health yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/newsroom/doh-announces-confirmed-measles-case-in-out-of-state-individual"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an alert about potential measles exposures in four counties after an out-of-state traveler visited the state while contagious. The exposures occurred in Adams, Clearfield, Lancaster, and York counties. Locations included two Mennonite facilities, along with a travel center, a restaurant, and an entertainment venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beetroot juice changed oral bacteria in older adults, lowering blood pressure. The results highlight dietary nitrate as a potential tool for healthier aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of nitrate-rich beetroot juice to lower blood pressure in older adults may be linked to measurable shifts in the community of bacteria living in the mouth, according to the largest study carried out to date on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation, led by researchers at the University of Exeter and published in &lt;em&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, compared how younger and older participants responded to the juice. Earlier studies have already established that diets high in nitrate can help reduce blood pressure, an effect that plays an important role in lowering the likelihood of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. These conditions are primarily driven by atherosclerosis, a process where plaque builds up in the arterial walls, leading to narrowed or blocked arteries. Risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and genetic predisposition. CVD remains a leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and preventive measures in managing and reducing the risk of heart-related illnesses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nitrate’s role in the body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrate plays an essential role in the body and is regularly consumed through vegetables as part of a healthy diet. In the study, older adults who drank a concentrated beetroot juice “shot” twice daily for two weeks experienced a drop in blood pressure. This effect, however, was not observed in the younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funded by a BBSRC Industrial Partnership Award, the research suggests that the reduction in blood pressure may be linked to changes in oral bacteria. The findings indicate that beetroot juice suppressed certain harmful microbes in the mouth, helping to restore a healthier balance. When the balance tips toward harmful bacteria, the body’s ability to convert dietary nitrate (common in vegetables) into nitric oxide is reduced. Nitric oxide is vital for maintaining flexible, healthy blood vessels and plays a central role in blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dietary recommendations for older adults&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study author Professor Anni Vanhatalo, of the University of Exeter, said: “We know that a nitrate-rich diet has health benefits, and older people produce less of their own nitric oxide as they age. They also tend to have higher blood pressure, which can be linked to cardiovascular complications like heart attack and stroke. Encouraging older adults to consume more nitrate-rich vegetables could have significant long-term health benefits. The good news is that if you don’t like beetroot, there are many nitrate-rich alternatives like spinach, rocket, fennel, celery, and kale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research enrolled 39 participants under the age of 30 and 36 individuals in their 60s and 70s through the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility, with additional support from the Exeter Clinical Trials Unit. Both age groups completed two separate two-week phases: one where they consumed nitrate-rich beetroot juice daily and another where they received a placebo version with the nitrate removed. Between these phases, each group observed a two-week “wash out” period to reset their systems. To evaluate the effects, the researchers used bacterial gene sequencing to identify which microbes were present in the participants’ mouths before and after each treatment phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Different effects by age group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both groups, the make-up of the oral microbiome changed significantly after drinking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, but these changes differed between the younger and older age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older age group experienced a notable decrease in the mouth bacteria Prevotella after drinking the nitrate rich juice, and an increase in the growth of bacteria known to benefit health such as Neisseria. The older group had higher average blood pressure at the start of the study, which fell after taking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, but not after taking the placebo supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Professor Andy Jones, of the University of Exeter, said: “This study shows that nitrate-rich foods alter the oral microbiome in a way that could result in less inflammation, as well as a lowering of blood pressure in older people. This paves the way for larger studies to explore the influence of lifestyle factors and biological sex in how people respond to dietary nitrate supplementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lee Beniston FRSB, Associate Director for Industry Partnerships and Collaborative Research and Development at BBSRC, said: “This research is a great example of how bioscience can help us better understand the complex links between diet, the microbiome and healthy aging. By uncovering how dietary nitrate affects oral bacteria and blood pressure in older adults, the study opens up new opportunities for improving vascular health through nutrition. BBSRC is proud to have supported this innovative partnership between academic researchers and industry to advance knowledge with real-world benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.06.003" target="_blank"&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that tolcapone increased activity in brain regions involved in inhibitory control, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These changes were associated with improved performance on a self-control task and fewer drinks consumed during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder involves both strong motivation to consume alcohol and a reduced ability to inhibit that motivation. Brain circuits that support self-control are thought to be impaired in people with this condition. Specifically, lower dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex has been observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder, and this may contribute to the loss of behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts to treat alcohol use disorder with dopamine-related medications have had mixed results, possibly because these drugs influence dopamine levels across broad brain regions. In contrast, tolcapone offers a more targeted approach. It inhibits an enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase, which breaks down dopamine primarily in the prefrontal cortex. By increasing dopamine availability specifically in this region, tolcapone may help restore some of the self-regulatory functions that are disrupted in alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol use disorder is a prevalent and devastating disease for which only three medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” said study author &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/trail-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Joseph P. Schacht&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These existing medications are believed to work by reducing craving for alcohol and/or changing its acute effects (increasing negative effects or reducing euphoric effects). A core symptom of alcohol use disorder is loss of control over drinking, and we wanted to explore whether a different kind of medication, which might increase behavioral control, might be effective for people with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tolcapone, an FDA-approved medication for Parkinson’s disease. Tolcapone inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. This means that it can transiently increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine. We often think of dopamine as being related to reward and euphoria, but in the prefrontal cortex, dopamine is critical for many cognitive processes that involve behavioral control. We thought that, by increasing prefrontal dopamine, tolcapone might increase behavioral control among people with alcohol use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina. Participants were adults aged 21 to 40 who met diagnostic criteria for moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. They were required to drink at least 20 standard drinks per week and were not seeking treatment for their alcohol use. A total of 64 individuals with usable brain imaging data were included in the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to receive either tolcapone or a placebo for eight days. Tolcapone dosage was gradually increased to a maximum of 200 mg three times per day. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after the medication period. The primary task used to measure self-control was the stop-signal task, which requires individuals to inhibit a dominant motor response when signaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tracked participants’ alcohol consumption using a daily self-report tool. To ensure the accuracy of the brain imaging results, several quality control measures were implemented, including controlling for motion during scanning and using different MRI scanner settings as covariates in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that participants who received tolcapone showed improvements in inhibitory control. This was measured by shorter stop-signal reaction times, indicating that they were better able to withhold a response when prompted. They also showed more behavioral adjustment after making errors, another indicator of improved self-regulation. These improvements were not seen in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to changes in behavior, tolcapone also increased activity in brain areas involved in self-control, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These increases were only observed in the tolcapone group. Notably, individuals who showed greater increases in activation in these areas also tended to report less alcohol consumption during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We suspected that greater tolcapone-induced prefrontal cortex activation might be related to better performance on the task, but were pleasantly surprised to find that it was also related to less alcohol consumption,” Schacht told PsyPost. “This suggests that tolcapone’s effect on behavioral control in the brain scanner translated to changes in real-world behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found changes in how brain regions communicated with each other. Tolcapone increased connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and two other brain regions—the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex—that are also involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control. These enhanced connections were linked to better task performance and fewer drinks consumed, but again, only in participants who received tolcapone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that boosting dopamine levels specifically in the prefrontal cortex may help restore self-control in people with alcohol use disorder. This has been a longstanding goal in addiction research, but previous approaches have struggled to achieve this without unintended effects in other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that tolcapone can influence both brain activity and real-world drinking behavior, the findings suggest that targeted dopamine modulation could be a promising therapeutic approach. The inferior frontal gyrus, in particular, emerged as a central hub in the network supporting self-regulation, with its activity and connectivity predicting both task performance and drinking outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure activity in the prefrontal cortex while people engaged in a simple behavioral control task,” Schacht summarized. “We found that tolcapone, relative to placebo, increased activation of a brain region called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and that increased activation of this region was associated with better behavioral control (better performance on the task) and less alcohol consumption during the time people were taking the medication. This suggests that medications like tolcapone that affect prefrontal dopamine might be a novel strategy for treating alcohol use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the mechanism appears to be related to dopamine, the researchers caution that other neurotransmitter systems—such as norepinephrine and glutamate—could also be involved. Additional studies will be needed to disentangle these contributions and to examine whether the effects of tolcapone extend beyond self-control to other aspects of alcohol use disorder, such as craving or mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, some limitations should be noted. The sample size, while sufficient for the planned analyses, was relatively small. Larger trials will be needed to confirm these results and assess how long the benefits of tolcapone might last. The study also excluded people with psychiatric comorbidities or other substance use disorders, so the generalizability of the findings to more diverse clinical populations remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers were not able to test genetic differences in how participants responded to the drug. The study was designed to examine whether genetic variation in a dopamine-related gene (COMT rs4680) affected the drug’s impact, but the number of participants in each genetic subgroup was too small to draw firm conclusions. Prior studies suggest that people with certain genetic variants may respond more strongly to tolcapone, and this will be an important area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although it is approved for Parkinson’s disease, tolcapone has the potential for liver toxicity, which can be dangerous among people who may have alcohol-associated liver disease,” Schacht noted. “In this study, we used tolcapone under very controlled conditions (people had to have normal liver function to participate, and they took the medication for only 8 days). There are several approved COMT inhibitors that are not toxic to the liver, but they do not cross the blood-brain barrier like tolcapone does. We hope that COMT inhibitors that are brain-penetrant but not hepatotoxic will be developed in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to better understand whether the effects of tolcapone are specific to improving inhibition of alcohol-related impulses or whether they reflect a broader enhancement of executive function. Future studies could compare how the drug affects brain responses to alcohol cues versus non-alcohol-related tasks, or examine whether it changes patterns of decision-making or emotional regulation in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03904498" target="_blank"&gt;completing a large study&lt;/a&gt; in which we are testing tolcapone among people with alcohol use disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,” Schacht said. “This is a population for which improvements in behavioral control might be especially impactful. We hope to publish our findings within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More efficacious medications for alcohol use disorder are badly needed. This study was one small step towards a larger goal within the alcohol research community of identifying novel medications to help improve the treatment of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.06.003" target="_blank"&gt;Effects of COMT suppression in a randomized trial on the neural correlates of inhibitory processing among people with Alcohol Use Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Drew E.
