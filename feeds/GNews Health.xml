"It is commonly found in products like cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to dietician Benson, tobacco is prepared for chewing or smoking by drying the leaves of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-R2aZ9vHgP4Hqs22Ukx5mN6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-R2aZ9vHgP4Hqs22Ukx5mN6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-tobacco-affect-your-sleep-and-why-3"&gt;How does tobacco affect your sleep and why?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco's negative effect on sleep all stems from the highly addictive nicotine within the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tobacco can cause sleep issues, especially when used within four to five hours of bedtime," explains Benson. "That’s because nicotine is a stimulant—it increases alertness and can make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hill, the stimulant can increase heart rate and delay the onset of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/rem-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/rem-sleep"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;. "As the nicotine wears off over the course of the night, it can cause a withdrawal effect that may lead to lighter sleep and frequent awakenings," she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-form-of-tobacco-use-is-worse-for-sleep-3"&gt;Which form of tobacco use is worse for sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both smoking and chewing tobacco can make it harder to fall asleep, which is actually worse for your sleep health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Hill and Benson agree that smoking is by far the worst form of tobacco use for sleep, even though other forms such as chewing and vaping also greatly disrupt sleep, due to the respiratory issues it causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smoking is typically the worst for sleep," Benson tells us. "Not just because of the nicotine, but also because it affects your breathing and may increase the risk of sleep disorders, like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep-problems/sleep-apnea" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep-problems/sleep-apnea"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill also points out that smokers feel the stimulating effect of nicotine differently to other tobacco users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smoking tobacco delivers nicotine to the bloodstream at a faster rate than chewing tobacco, leading to a quicker stimulant effect," she says. "Those who smoke also tend to be more at risk for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/insomnia-what-is-it-whats-the-cause-and-how-to-tackle-it" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/insomnia-what-is-it-whats-the-cause-and-how-to-tackle-it"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-stop-restless-legs-immediately-for-a-good-nights-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-stop-restless-legs-immediately-for-a-good-nights-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-happens-to-your-sleep-after-quitting-tobacco-3"&gt;What happens to your sleep after quitting tobacco?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that ditching tobacco and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-quitting-smoking-can-benefit-your-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-quitting-smoking-can-benefit-your-sleep"&gt;quitting smoking can greatly improve your sleep&lt;/a&gt;, but the bad news is that it takes time to feel the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s possible for sleep to worsen the first few weeks after quitting tobacco due to nicotine withdrawals," warns Hill. "Some symptoms experienced may include insomnia, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-prevent-night-sweats" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-prevent-night-sweats"&gt;night sweats&lt;/a&gt;, and vivid dreams."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Hill emphasises that after this period, sleep quality improves. "People who quit smoking tend to experience the benefits of falling asleep faster, having more &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/deep-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/deep-sleep"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt; and longer sleep durations, and fewer awakenings," the health expert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benson agrees, telling us how long you'll typically need to wait to see improvement. "It usually gets better within 3 to 4 weeks," reassures the nutrition advisor. "But talk to your healthcare provider if your sleep doesn’t start to improve."&lt;/p&gt;

As he told it, he had built on the work of earlier researchers — including his mentor Willem Johan Kolff — while putting “a general concept” into action and refining features like the artificial heart’s strong yet flexible diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NY3L4BZGZZBPBLCJRAM52P34ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers had struggled for years to find a way to power an artificial heart, and for a time considered &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-true-story-of-the-government-programs-that-tried-to-build-an-atomic-heart/274266/" target="_blank"&gt;using radioactive plutonium&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Jarvik’s creation was plugged in to the outside world, tethered by six-foot-long hoses to a bulky air compressor about the size of a small refrigerator. He said he aimed to develop a more compact pump unit, one that could be worn like a backpack, and hoped to eventually design a self-contained system that could be implanted near the heart and powered through external batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LOHPZOOMNNHQBLG6PS3UF6HHIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If the artificial heart is ever to achieve its objective, it must be more than a pump,” Dr. Jarvik wrote in Scientific American. “It must also be more than functional, reliable and dependable.

After undergoing surgery in 1984 at a hospital in Louisville, he drank a beer, chatted happily with reporters and spoke on the phone with President Ronald Reagan, discussing an issue with his Social Security benefits. But his condition deteriorated after he suffered first one stroke and then another. He died after 620 days, outliving two more artificial-heart patients who had received the device after he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRDBTTIUGJCZPKOBRBACCXOD6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If he had anticipated the hardship this has been on the family,” his wife told Life magazine, “he might not have done it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HHSFXBPTXBFSVJNPI77XSMMURI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Schroeder’s decline was covered extensively by the press — and heightened debates about whether the artificial heart was worth the financial cost (the device was priced at $16,450, or about $54,000 in today’s money) and the medical complications that followed. Some doctors argued that the Jarvik-7 needed more testing before being used in human patients. The director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, among other experts, called on Dr. Jarvik and his team to put a pause on their experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GIU7CBOBZZFUPIZYW5BVFQQPBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the institute moved to halt federal funding for artificial-heart research in 1988, the New York Times editorial board rejoiced, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/16/opinion/the-dracula-of-medical-technology.html" target="_blank"&gt;calling the program&lt;/a&gt; “the Dracula of Medical Technology.” The Los Angeles Times later summed up criticism of the device in &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-01-12-mn-432-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;a headline&lt;/a&gt;: “Artificial Heart — a Case of Pushing Science ‘Too Fast.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHU7EBGG3JFZBNMEOSDYE6ESNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 1990, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/01/11/fda-recalls-artificial-heart-used-in-historic-transplants/dc6ad63f-4280-44e8-b2df-881af051038c/" target="_blank"&gt;withdrew approval&lt;/a&gt; for the use of Dr. Jarvik’s artificial heart, citing quality-control problems and deficiencies at its manufacturing plant.

That approach persisted with subsequent artificial hearts, the descendants of Dr. Jarvik’s design: In 2016, the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/us/artificial-hearts-ticking-along-decades-after-jarvik-7-debate.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that artificial hearts had been used about 1,600 times as a bridge to human transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TY5SGDYIJFCSTHMWG5JU2WJWDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Interviewed by &lt;a href="https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;amp;context=sumagazine" target="_blank"&gt;Syracuse University Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, Dr. Jarvik said his belief that the device could gain use as a widespread, permanent replacement for the human heart was “probably the biggest mistake I have ever made.” He later joined other researchers in developing small battery-powered heart pumps — ventricular assist devices, or VADs — intended to support an ailing heart rather than replace it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YGSRMJTCJVFUJD4T55JVFK46QE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That approach has proved popular, said Arthur L. Caplan, a medical ethics scholar at New York University who was critical of the Jarvik-7.

He was also, apparently, not a rower: The ad agency had hired a stunt double for the lake scenes.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest airport warning came Friday as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14719723/warning-newark-liberty-airport-contagious-disease-infected.html"&gt;three passengers flying into Denver International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on the same Turkish Airlines flight tested positive for measles. One of them was a vaccinated adult.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2025, precise data on the number of US adults unvaccinated against measles is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, historical estimates suggest that approximately 10 percent of adults may lack immunity, either due to never receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine or because their immunity has diminished over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the US adult population of about 258 million, this could translate to roughly 25 million adults who are potentially unprotected against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 90 percent of confirmed cases are tied to outbreaks in the US rather than travel outside the country.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms - which include a blotchy rash, fever, cough and runny nose - typically develop seven to 21 days after initial exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles spreads via airborne droplets released in coughs and sneezes, which can hang in the air for up to two hours after a patient passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is particularly dangerous to young children, with the CDC saying one in 20 unvaccinated children who are infected develop pneumonia while one in 1,000 suffer deadly brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A total of 1,088 Americans have been infected so far this year, and two unvaccinated young girls have died.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 03:03:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府结束寻找艾滋病毒疫苗的关键计划-《纽约时报》 | Trump Administration Ends Program Critical to Search for an H.I.V.

NB.1.8.1 does not appear to cause more severe disease than other strains in circulation, although it may be more transmissible, according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f4gsg"&gt;It also remains extremely rare in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6jql9"&gt;Only two cases of NB.1.8.1 have been detected in New York state so far, and fewer than 20 have been found nationwide, according to the state health department and CDC, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="57kus"&gt;City data shows this latest version of the virus has yet to rank among the &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-variants.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;most dominant variants&lt;/a&gt; in the five boroughs, where overall cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#daily" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;declining&lt;/a&gt; since late March. It is also still too rare to register on the CDC’s COVID-19 Data Tracker dashboard, according to Belsie González, a spokesperson for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="74bi8"&gt;“When it comes to the spike protein sequence, it doesn’t look particularly concerning to me,” said Andy Pekosz, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="87ekb"&gt;NB.1.8.1 appears to be recognized by antibodies that have been generated by other recent variants, Pekosz explained. “So it doesn’t look like a particularly worrisome variant in terms of how well it can evade population immunity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ffuaa"&gt;Rachel Vick, a spokesperson for the city health department, said the agency “has a robust disease surveillance system and is monitoring the situation, as we do for any potential threats that could impact the health of New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dk7pp"&gt;The state health department is also monitoring the variant, along with other COVID-19 strains, said Marissa Crary, a spokesperson for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5aeck"&gt;While NB.1.8.1 may be laying low in New York so far, the virus overall does not appear to be going away.

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that the CDC is no longer recommending COVID-19 vaccination for “healthy children and healthy pregnant women,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women-rfk-jr.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;raising concerns&lt;/a&gt; among many public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6f286"&gt;“If this announcement becomes federal policy, it would restrict access to safe and effective COVID vaccines for pregnant people and children, increasing the risk of serious illness and hospitalization,” Crary of the state health department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="69b4p"&gt;In addition to influencing medical guidance, recommendations from the CDC help determine which shots are &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/could-trump-rfk-jr-affect-vaccinations-in-ny-public-health-experts-weigh-in" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6a7sq"&gt;Officials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have separately said they plan to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;restrict approvals&lt;/a&gt; for COVID-19 vaccines this fall to people over 65 and those with certain health conditions, while conducting additional research on the shots for healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 00:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPQjB1UWQycjJJckNUMlg5ZnB6WTR0MXI5M3VEZlZ1N1FCbzVDdjd6RHNMZlNfMkxnTVdobnVYQmljMVBFS0gtdkhTckFOMFBJMGd1NmlBOFBCSGRFUzhIOHBQV0t4QURDcmpKaG45dkF6dWkzNDdSaHNscmRvZ1lad1d2STNNZjNob2JuUlA3MHpvRTBTVnlMSw</guid></item><item><title>科学揭穿了生产力大师的早晨口头禅：冷水淋浴和早起一样无用。- Stewartville Star | Science has debunked the morning mantra of productivity gurus: cold showers are just as useless as waking up early. - Stewartville Star</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6wFBVV95cUxNbU5pdEpYY29HcUZORU80RC1vTXNWWHlOR1hHS0xjanFBUUFfZk9GREFla3BwSk9udTJQdmhueWx3b2R6eWMzdVZtVzlrT3ctbXBmZ1U1NzJRVmlzVmR3TjVCLVExQ3JORE9aOHFhTVVsSWZ5T1lkMTNhYkJ1UnRaamNEZ18tWlZVTXhOTTVlVVJmZmpnOV96NS1JTzhScl9pSmR2SFY4a0VXNFNRMzhVMFQ2TXZ5R2NONkh0V1h0NElQbGZNcGtlOGZZZlprNk83NThaOXliZW9VR2RLZEdENnI1MXQ1ckstby1z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a new trend has emerged among productivity and well-being gurus: cold showers, or even baths in the middle of ice. You’ll have seen videos of athletes like LeBron James immersing themselves in an icy bath. Even Gwyneth Paltrow has tried it.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;Are ice baths and cold showers really good for your health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Presented as an ideal solution for reducing stress, reducing inflammation and boosting the immune system, these methods can seem like a panacea for improving health and increasing daily efficiency. And there are plenty of influencers touting their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-2688898316"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, science has begun to debunk these claims, revealing that the supposed benefits of ice baths are not as solid as they seem… To this end, researchers from the University of South Australia recently conducted a meta-analysis of 11 international studies. They published their findings in the scientific &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615" data-type="link" data-id="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615"&gt;journal PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/29/scientists-have-discovered-one-of-the-largest-gold-deposits-in-history-containing-over-1100-tons/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Scientists have discovered one of the largest gold deposits in history, containing over 1,100 tons.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis used data from cold baths and showers at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15ºC, over durations ranging from 30 seconds to two hours. The aim was to assess the real effects of cold water immersion, which has become increasingly popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1404013449"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elite athletes often use these practices to recover after competitions, and they have been widely publicised as beneficial for the general public. However, researchers have discovered that the evidence supporting these benefits is mainly applicable to athletes, and not to the general population.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of stress reduction, the results indicate that immersion in ice-cold water can indeed reduce stress levels, but only temporarily, for around 12 hours after exposure. This means that there is no immediate and lasting effect on psychological well-being.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, although some people report an improvement in quality of life after taking cold showers lasting between 20 and 90 seconds, these effects generally fade after three months, indicating a lack of prolonged benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/29/a-devastating-tsunami-fossilized-in-amber-reveals-secrets-115-million-years-old/"&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;The limits and risks of ice baths&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Australian team’s research also explored the impact of ice baths on sleep quality and the immune system. Although some of the data suggests an improvement in sleep, these conclusions are based on limited samples and are exclusively male. More research is therefore needed before they can be generalised to the population as a whole.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as the impact of cold showers on the immune system is concerned, it was found that people who took them had 29% fewer absences from work due to illness. However, there is no solid evidence to show that these showers actually improve the immune response in any significant way.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, contrary to popular belief, ice baths do not reduce muscular inflammation. On the contrary, they appear to cause a significant increase in inflammation, both immediately and one hour after exposure. This is the result of an ‘acute inflammatory response’ by the body to heat stress, which can be beneficial for athletes by helping to strengthen muscles, but potentially harmful for those with pre-existing pathologies.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, although cold showers may offer some temporary benefits, particularly for athletes, they do not offer any lasting or widespread benefits for the general population. Unless you’re a top sportsperson, taking a cold shower won’t improve your productivity. At most, it will have saved you a little time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/27/although-it-was-thought-to-be-lost-between-earth-and-the-moon-this-satellite-sent-in-1974-has-against-all-odds-resurfaced-on-american-space-defense-radars/"&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;What about getting up early?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same goes for the idea that getting up at five in the morning improves productivity. Here too, science has shown that the benefits of this practice depend on many factors, including genetics. Individual biological clocks influence our ability to get up early.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although getting up early can offer personal time for activities such as exercise and a healthy breakfast, it also means going to bed earlier, which can affect social life and reduce exposure to daylight, essential for vitamin D synthesis.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study suggests that getting enough sleep, regular exercise and eating a nutritious breakfast are crucial to waking up early in the morning. However, daily obligations and individual lifestyles mean that this lifestyle is not suitable for everyone, and forcing such a change can have negative consequences for health and productivity.

head and neck cancer could live longer without their cancer returning thanks to an immunotherapy drug, a clinical trial suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is the first sign of a breakthrough for patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer for 20 years, say scientists behind the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Laura Marston, 45, from Derbyshire, says she is "amazed she's still here" after being given "dire" chances of survival following a diagnosis of advanced tongue cancer six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She received the immunotherapy before and after surgery, which researchers say helps the body learn to attack the cancer if it returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cancers in the head and neck are notoriously difficult to treat and there's been little change in the way patients are treated in two decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;More than half those diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancers die within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Laura was given only a 30% chance of surviving that long after her diagnosis in 2019, after having an ulcer on her tongue which wouldn't go away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The next step was major surgery to remove her tongue, as well as lymph nodes in her neck, and then she had to learn to talk and eat again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I was 39 and I was devastated," she told BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As part of an international study into new ways to treat the cancer, involving experts from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, Laura was one of more than 350 patients given the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab before and after surgery to prime the body's defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Kevin Harrington, who led the trial in the UK, explains: "We give the immune system the chance to have a good look at the tumour to generate anti-tumour immunity and then, after removal of the tumour, we continue to amplify that immune response by giving the drug continually for up to a year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A similar number of patients diagnosed with similar cancers received the usual care offered. They all had advanced head and neck cancers in one area, that had not spread to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The new approach showed positive results. It doubled the length of time patients were cancer free, on average, from around 2.5 years to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After three years, patients given pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;'Given me my life back'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Six years on, Laura is working full-time and says she's "in a good place and doing really well".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's been phenomenal for me, because I'm here, able to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I wasn't expected to come this far," Laura says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My prognosis was quite dire." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had muscle taken from her left arm and placed into her mouth to fill the void left by her tongue. It has been a tough journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Just having this amazing immunotherapy has given me my life back again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers say the key to their results was giving patients the drug before surgery, which trains the body to hunt down and kill the cancer if it ever comes back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Harrington says immunotherapy "could change the world" for these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It significantly decreases the chance of cancer spreading around the body, at which point it's incredibly difficult to treat," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;About 12,800 new head and neck cancer cases are diagnosed in the UK every year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The approach worked "particularly well" for some patients, but it was "really exciting" to see the treatment benefitting all the patients in the trial, Prof Harrington said.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every year, nearly 800,000 Americans have a stroke—it’s one of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news is that some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strokes can be prevented through lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We also know that certain eating patterns, like the Mediterranean diet, are linked to lower risk factors for stroke, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/284021/5-new-things-to-know-about-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from a long-running U.S. study called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). After weeding through potential participants, they ended up with 2,642 for this current assessment. Around 54% of them were female, and participants had an average age of 63. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For NHANES, participants completed several 24-hour dietary recalls, documenting what they had eaten the previous day. For this study, researchers took those recalls and looked for foods containing zinc, as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/zinc-supplement-ill-never-travel-without-8417707" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;zinc-containing supplements&lt;/a&gt;. The average of two 24-hour dietary recalls was used for each participant’s total zinc intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then divided participants into four quartiles (or groups) based on zinc intake: less than 6.08 mg/day (Q1), 6.08-8.83 mg/day (Q2), 8.84-13.02 mg/day (Q3) and more than 13.02 mg/day (Q4).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The assessment of stroke was also self-reported and based on whether a health professional had ever diagnosed the participant with a stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During statistical analyses, researchers adjusted for factors including age, gender, race or ethnicity, BMI, smoking history, average caloric intake, health history and some other factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running several statistical analyses, researchers state that those who consumed about 6 to 9 mg per day of zinc had a lower risk of stroke compared to those who consumed less than 6 mg per day. Specifically, those in Q2 had 36% lower odds of having a stroke compared to those in Q1. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, higher zinc intake—more than 9 mg per day (Q3 and Q4)—did not provide any more protection against stroke risk than consuming 6 to 9 mg per day (Q2) did. That suggests that moderation is key when it comes to zinc consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has several limitations, including the fact that everything was self-reported, including dietary intake, stroke diagnosis and medical history. This always leaves room for bias and inaccuracies in remembering. The study sample size of participants used was also small, which tends to lower the statistical power and accuracy of the results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, this study cannot establish cause and effect. In other words, it cannot be said that lower zinc intake increases stroke risk; it can only be concluded that there appears to be an association between zinc intake and stroke risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The recommended intake for zinc is a minimum of 8 mg/day for women and 11 mg/day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So it’s interesting that the benefits of zinc were seen even for those who fell under the minimum recommended amount. The upper limit for zinc is 40 mg/day for both men and women—eat or take more than that, and it can be harmful and cause some nasty side effects, including headaches, upset stomach and vomiting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lower stroke risk isn’t the only thing zinc may help with. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/zinc-aging-study-11735798" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;We previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that people who had recommended levels of zinc intake had &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/3-habits-aging-study-8787260" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slower biological aging&lt;/a&gt; compared to those with too little or too much zinc. And its positive effects multiplied when people were also getting enough physical activity. It’s important to note, though, that those taking more than the recommended upper limit of 40 mg/day showed an increase of 7 years of biological aging. Again, more is not necessarily better, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-take-too-many-vitamins-8652764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;it can result in overdosing&lt;/a&gt;, even with vitamins and minerals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/zinc-benefits-8407152" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Zinc is important&lt;/a&gt; because it’s involved in many processes in the body, including immunity, growth and development and wound healing. It’s also necessary for proper cell development and for manufacturing DNA. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zinc is found in many foods, including meats, poultry, seafood, dairy, nuts and seeds. Eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet (a diet specifically for healthy blood pressure) and the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fusion of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, all provide plenty of zinc-rich foods and limit sodium, added sugars and processed and red meats—all factors that play into disease risk, including stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke. If you’re trying to manage your blood pressure, give this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-high-blood-pressure-8663336" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;7-Day High-Protein Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for High Blood Pressure&lt;/a&gt; a go. Physical activity, stress and sleep also play major roles in managing blood pressure and stroke prevention, so assess which areas need some attention. Choose one or two areas and start with small, sustainable changes so that you can gradually build on your success over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that the minimal daily recommended amount of zinc was associated with a reduced risk of stroke compared to those with lower levels; the benefits plateaued, and those with higher levels than the minimal recommended amount did not show any additional benefits regarding stroke risk. Include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676887/zinc-rich-foods-to-boost-your-immunity/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in zinc&lt;/a&gt; each day, like meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, nuts and seeds. If you think your zinc intake might be too low or too high, meet with a registered dietitian or healthcare provider who can help figure that out. A dietitian can also help you determine if &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-zinc-supplements-8751661" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt; would be helpful if you’re having trouble eating enough foods rich in zinc.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — The largest egg producer in the southwest will have to shut down a majority of egg production for nearly two years following a recent avian flu infection, company officials announced Friday. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of egg operations are being paused, Hickman’s still has smaller farms in Maricopa and in Colorado, which will continue producing eggs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Glenn Hickman of Hickman's Family Farms in Buckeye said the company will have to lay off hundreds of employees as they work to rebuild their flock. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's going to be a lot of those people that are going to be negatively affected," Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, six million chickens have died at Hickman's as a result of the most recent infection. Hickman said that accounts for 95% of their chickens in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We shut down all traffic between farms and all personnel, everything we possibly could do to isolate that farm, and it didn't work," Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickman's is one of the top 20 egg producers in the country, but Hickman does not believe the situation at their farm will impact the price of eggs. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third-generation egg producer, Hickman's, has been in operation for nearly 80 years. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickman said that the new threat from the bird flu is that it is now being found in local animals, not just migrating birds. Local sparrows, mice and squirrels have all tested positive for bird flu, Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bird flu vaccine available internationally but it has not been approved by the USDA for use in chickens in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to be able to start giving it to our flocks, and the quicker that we can start vaccinating our nation's poultry flock, the quicker that we can get back to normalized operations," Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about what this will do for egg prices in Arizona, Hickman doesn't expect there to be a sharp increase and believes that prices will normalize after steadily declining since January.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

In a cohort of 191 individuals, AD patients on SSRIs had lower levels of plasma phosphorylated tau-181, a key indicator of disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans also showed that SSRIs restored metabolic activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), an early site of tau accumulation and serotonin production. This metabolic recovery was not observed in healthy individuals, suggesting a disease-specific effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Tau Biomarkers:&lt;/strong&gt; AD patients on SSRIs had significantly lower levels of p-tau181, a blood-based marker of tau pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restored Brain Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; SSRIs reversed hypometabolism in the dorsal raphe nucleus, a serotonin-rich region and early site of Alzheimer’s damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed Cognitive Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; While some cognitive scores improved, results varied across different testing methods, complicating conclusions about functional benefit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a common class of antidepressants, may do more than lift mood: they might help reduce the biological burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that long-term SSRI use in patients with AD is associated with reduced tau pathology, a hallmark of the disease, and restored activity in a key brain region—though the effects on memory and cognition remain complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110524"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/SSRI-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Researchers emphasize that this was a cross-sectional study, meaning it can’t prove cause and effect. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a tiny region deep in the brainstem, is one of the earliest areas to show tau accumulation in AD. It’s also the brain’s primary source of serotonin, the neurotransmitter targeted by SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research shows that in people with Alzheimer’s, the DRN becomes metabolically sluggish—but SSRI treatment appears to reverse this, boosting its activity back toward healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 191 participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), comparing individuals with and without SSRI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They measured a blood biomarker of tau pathology (phosphorylated tau-181, or p-tau181), conducted brain scans of metabolic activity, and evaluated cognitive performance across different tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that AD patients who were using SSRIs had significantly lower plasma p-tau181 levels than those not taking antidepressants. These results suggest a potential protective effect of SSRIs on tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging confirmed that the DRN in AD patients is typically hypometabolic—essentially underactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, patients on SSRIs showed restored glucose metabolism in this region, a sign of revived neural function. This effect was specific to those with AD; healthy control participants showed no change in DRN metabolism with SSRI use, possibly due to a built-in feedback regulation in the serotonin system that dampens unnecessary activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising biological findings, the impact of SSRIs on cognitive performance was mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some patients performed better on certain cognitive tests (like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or MoCA), others did not show measurable improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the usual correlation between different cognitive assessments broke down in SSRI users—hinting that antidepressants may affect how cognitive decline is measured, rather than how it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that this was a cross-sectional study, meaning it can’t prove cause and effect. It also couldn’t account for the specific types or dosages of SSRIs used, nor whether treatment began before or after AD symptoms emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these results offer strong support for further clinical trials exploring the timing, duration, and cognitive impact of SSRI treatment in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, this study adds to growing evidence that the brain’s serotonin system is deeply intertwined with Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SSRIs are primarily prescribed for mood disorders, they may also influence key processes in Alzheimer’s—including the metabolism of vulnerable brain regions and the spread of toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to probe the connection between mood, memory, and brain chemistry, SSRIs may offer a surprising ally in the fight against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SSRIs reduce plasma tau and restore dorsal raphe metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Dylan J.

As a serotonergic hub, DRN activity is altered by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which also have variable effects on cognitive decline and pathology in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz14579-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined &lt;em&gt;N &lt;/em&gt;= 191 subjects with baseline &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and plasma biomarker data to study the effects of SSRIs on tau pathology, cognitive decline, and DRN metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz14579-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) was lower with SSRI use.

Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because we typically make enough creatine to survive, federal health officials don’t make recommendations for how much we should consume, and it is not considered an essential nutrient, said Jose Antonio, a professor of exercise science at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Most of our bodies require about two grams of creatine per day to perform their basic functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you eat meat, you probably get a good chunk of this — about one to two grams per day — from your diet.

While small dense LDL cholesterol—linked to heart disease—was associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk, other markers like ApoB48 were linked to reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, even low levels of “good” HDL cholesterol were associated with &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; dementia risk in this study. These findings suggest that lipid metabolism may play different roles in heart and brain health, and that blood lipid profiles could help predict or even prevent Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Cholesterol Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher small dense LDL-C levels were tied to a 21% increased Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Fat Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher ApoB48 levels—linked to dietary fat transport—were tied to a 22% lower risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected HDL Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants with the lowest HDL-C (good cholesterol) had a 44% &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Southwestern&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are at higher risk for heart disease also seem more likely to develop dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And research led by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has discovered new associations between various lipid, or fat, levels in the blood and the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings mean that using blood lipid profiles could help better understand, predict and possibly even prevent the disease in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In more than 800 older adults who were part of the long-running Framingham Heart Study, the researchers found that higher levels of small dense cholesterol particles – which are known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease – were associated with higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, higher levels of a marker for small fat-carrying particles, which are involved in the transport of dietary fats from the gut to other body tissues through the blood after eating, were associated with lower risk of developing the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps ironically, the researchers also discovered that individuals who had the lowest levels of highly dense cholesterol particles – often referred to as “good cholesterol” as it is considered protective against cardiovascular disease – had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease compared to the rest of the included individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These findings highlight the complex relationships of blood lipids with both heart and brain health, suggesting the possibility of certain blood lipids playing different roles in cardiovascular disease and dementia-related biological processes,” said Sokratis Charisis, MD, a researcher with the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charisis is first author of the study published May 30 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, titled, “Association of Blood Lipoprotein Levels With Incident Alzheimer’s Disease in Community-Dwelling Individuals: The Framingham Heart Study.” Other authors include corresponding author Sudha Seshadri, MD, director of the Biggs Institute, and researchers from Boston University School of Public Health, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and the Framingham Heart Study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A community-based analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new study notes that dementia is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Worldwide, there were 57.4 million people living with dementia in 2019, a number that is expected to reach 152.8 million by 2050.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is a general trend over time of decreasing incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in the U.S. and other higher-income countries that is at least partially attributed to better management of cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Framingham Heart Study is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that was launched in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Residents there ages 30 to 59 were randomly selected from census data to participate. Those with definite signs of cardiovascular disease at baseline were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants of the original cohort have undergone up to 32 examinations performed every two years, which have included detailed history-taking by a physician, a physical examination and lab testing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The latest analysis by researchers led by UT Health San Antonio included participants from the original cohort who were 60 years or older and free of dementia during an examination period of 1985-1988, and had available cognitive follow-up and lipoprotein marker data. Lipoproteins act as a transport system for lipids in the bloodstream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood lipid levels and dementia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or good cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or “bad cholesterol”; small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C); and other lipoprotein types associated with heart disease were measured in blood samples obtained from the mid- to late-‘80s examination period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Framingham participants were watched for incident Alzheimer’s disease, meaning a first diagnosis of the disease, until 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of a total of 822 participants, 128 developed incident Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers discovered that an increase of 1 standard deviation unit (SDU) of a concentration of small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), a value representing how far a specific data point deviates from the mean, was associated with a 21% increase in the risk for incident Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the name implies, small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C) is a type of the so-called bad cholesterol with smaller and denser particles than other low-density lipoproteins, and that is considered more likely to form plaque in arteries, strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 1 SDU increase in a concentration of ApoB48, a lipoprotein that transports dietary fat from the intestines and into the bloodstream that also is tied to heart disease and cardiovascular problems, was found to be associated with a 22% decrease in the risk for incident Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants in the first quartile of HDL-C, or good cholesterol – in order of lesser amounts – were 44% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s compared with those in the second, third and fourth quartiles. And those with small dense LDL-C concentrations below the median were 38% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s compared with those with concentrations above the median.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, then, lower small-density bad cholesterol (sdLDL-C) concentrations and higher ApoB48 concentrations were associated with a lower Alzheimer’s risk. And individuals with the lowest good cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s compared with the remaining sample.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These findings underscore links between lipoprotein metabolism pathways and Alzheimer’s risk, emphasizing the potential role of blood lipoprotein markers in Alzheimer’s risk stratification and of lipid modification strategies in dementia prevention,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8be7eeeef8b9b9cbfeffe3f8e8f8eaa5eeeffe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Southwestern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Lee – UT Southwestern&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Association of Blood Lipoprotein Levels With Incident Alzheimer’s Disease in Community-Dwelling Individuals: The Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Sokratis Charisis et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association of Blood Lipoprotein Levels With Incident Alzheimer’s Disease in Community-Dwelling Individuals: The Framingham Heart Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular risk factors are important contributors to the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). To further explore the physiologic links between cardiovascular health and AD risk, we studied the associations between various blood lipoprotein levels and AD risk in community-dwelling older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal analysis included participants aged 60 years or older without prevalent dementia and with available cognitive follow-up and lipoprotein marker data from the Framingham Heart Study. Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and the ApoB isoform ApoB48 were measured in blood samples obtained from 1985 to 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were under surveillance for incident AD until 2020. AD diagnosis was based on standard clinical criteria. The relationships between blood lipoprotein levels (expressed as both continuous variables and quartiles) and AD incidence were examined using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for baseline age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 822 participants (mean [SD] age 72.5 [3.7] years, 538 [65.5%] women) were followed for a median (interquartile range) of 12.55 (7.34–15) years, during which 128 participants developed incident AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase of 1 standard deviation unit (SDU) in ln(sdLDL-C) concentration was associated with a 21% increase in the risk of incident AD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.01–1.45), whereas a 1-SDU increase in ln(ApoB48) concentration was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of incident AD (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the first HDL-C quartile were 44% less likely to develop AD compared with those in the second, third, and fourth HDL-C quartiles (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.95). Participants with sdLDL-C concentrations below the median were 38% less likely to develop AD compared with those with sdLDL-C concentrations above the median (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower sdLDL-C and higher ApoB48 concentrations were associated with a lower AD risk. In addition, individuals with the lowest HDL-C concentrations were less likely to develop AD compared with the remaining sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings underscore links between lipoprotein metabolism pathways and AD risk, emphasizing the potential role of blood lipoprotein markers in AD risk stratification and of lipid modification strategies in dementia prevention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 20:42:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBtck5CeHpld2tmaTVRbGJLbW93NHgzdEpSb084WkdYNlFWcmYxMGJNZkdsWVl1V3djMnpDRUJKLXRuR1QtQ0tIS2VQZjl6cE8yN0p1MHV0WUI3c0RMblRjVTFodFZZeVhJMzN1czJUOA</guid></item><item><title>湾区居民将3家热门商店暴露于高传染性麻疹- SFGATE | Bay Area resident exposed 3 popular stores to highly contagious measles - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQVUN5QWxqbFlBb3RFcE1HeHVNSXp1X25ES0xxbk42LUZxN0s1cDNKUTduRUR3RTBmQWMxTG9XVzJLM3JMRjRfbXlCRUtiaUlhd3cxcEpBVkMxMVRVREdiMnJEQkFPUzVCSF9jYVZSYThyV0hkVTNQR0JYU3FHQnRkdG80c3J5X3JwSjJV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

            Pharmaceutical rivals don’t often come to each other’s defense. But after the US Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/health/hhs-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine"&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; a contract with drugmaker Moderna to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine, claiming that “mRNA technology remains under-tested,” Pfizer’s chief executive is speaking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00033b6mnvpmqemj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “MRNA probably is the most utilized vaccine in the history of humanity,” Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla said Friday, noting that there have been about 1.5 billion mRNA vaccine doses against Covid-19 administered worldwide from his company alone – not counting those from Moderna. “So it is extremely well-tested.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00043b6m8g30iflh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said Wednesday that it was canceling at least $590 million in federal funding the previous administration had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/bird-flu-vaccine-funding-hhs-moderna"&gt;granted&lt;/a&gt; for Moderna to use its mRNA technology to develop pandemic influenza vaccines, including those against H5 avian flu viruses. The H5N1 strain has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; at least 70 people and killed one in the US since last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00053b6ms5dch60e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We concluded that continued investment in Moderna’s H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,” an HHS spokesperson said, claiming, “the reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.05.21-PSI-Majority-Staff-Interim-Report-Failure-to-Warn.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; from the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00063b6mexj533vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked his response to those comments, Bourla responded, “both of them are completely inaccurate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00073b6mrh0ngfqf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharma giant’s chief spoke with CNN on Friday as Pfizer presented &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; on a colorectal cancer drug at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, conference in Chicago, the world’s largest meeting on cancer research. Pfizer’s drug, Braftovi, was shown to double the length of time patients with an aggressive form of colorectal cancer lived with treatment: an average of 30 months compared with 15 in a clinical trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00083b6mbgb9gmod@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a “very, very important finding,” Bourla said, noting that colorectal cancer rates, “particularly among younger people, are skyrocketing right now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry00093b6mk8ingkx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while Pfizer is making big bets on cancer research, its CEO said he’s not taking his foot off the pedal with investment in vaccines either, despite a “very big gap” between the company and HHS – particularly Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – on their approaches to the subject.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000a3b6mtn8x8v9n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The science is proven,” Bourla said. “The things they will do that will reduce, maybe, vaccination rates will come back and bite us.” Diseases will return, he said, and “that will not take a long time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000b3b6mif9owvub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, the US is experiencing one of its largest &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/measles-cases-us-dg"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks since the disease was declared eliminated in this country in 2000, and rates of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/health/whooping-cough-pertussis-vaccine-wellness"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;, or pertussis, have increased as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000c3b6mrfb0x81t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The recurrence of disease probably “means that immediately they will have to reverse it,” Bourla said, suggesting that there will be public health efforts to increase vaccination rates in response, and “they will go back to what every country in the world is doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000d3b6mb4qykwn4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bourla worked with the first Trump administration to advance the company’s Covid-19 vaccine through Operation Warp Speed in 2020, although he noted that Pfizer didn’t accept federal funding to support vaccine development, only for the purchase of vaccines after the fact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000e3b6mqjids84j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said that despite the gap on vaccines, “when you speak with them, including Secretary Kennedy, I have found several topics that we are in, surprisingly, alignment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000f3b6m3sea34by@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Taking on cancer is one key area of agreement, according to the company. Bourla cited executive orders from President Donald Trump encompassing issues like addressing shorter market exclusivity for pills compared with injectable medicines under the Inflation Reduction Act – something the industry calls the “pill penalty” – drug discounts to hospitals in a program known as &lt;a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa" target="_blank"&gt;340B&lt;/a&gt;, and ratcheting up scrutiny on pharmacy benefit managers’ role in drug pricing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000g3b6msfqf29gz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are working to address those things as we agree to disagree on the things that divide us,” Bourla said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000h3b6mr2tuyk5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He noted that he is against the administration’s proposed 40% budget cut for the National Institutes of Health, emphasizing that the US is “the dominant scientific force in biomedical sciences right now, and it is because we have created this ecosystem,” in which NIH funding supports academic research that can lead to new discoveries picked up by the pharmaceutical industry and made into medicines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000i3b6mlbnatg9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we break any link of this chain of this large ecosystem,” Bourla said, “that’s not good for us, and actually, it’s a gift to our friends in China.”

            Bourla also took issue with HHS’s actions on Covid-19 vaccines in the past two weeks: saying that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/covid-vaccine-fda-changes"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; will change the way it approves updated shots for people who aren’t in vulnerable groups and that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; will no longer recommend Covid-19 vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In previous years, Covid-19 vaccines had been updated in a similar way to seasonal flu shots, based on evidence that they generate an immune response; clinical trials that are required to show a vaccine’s effect in preventing cases of disease are thought to take too long, potentially, to be feasible every season. What’s more, the FDA and its advisers had previously deemed the vaccine updates small enough to not change their safety profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000l3b6m38hx0z6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked whether Pfizer would be able to run clinical trials quickly enough to make updated vaccines available to everyone, not just those in vulnerable groups, Bourla said, “You are raising some very real concerns that we have.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000m3b6mo5nxrtix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bourla noted that the implications of the Trump administration’s changes to US health agency policies aren’t entirely clear. But “the issue is that that is not based on any scientific data. It’s just based on a belief.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The appropriate process has not been followed; this is not just: the secretary or someone at a high level issues, let’s say, a new rule,” he said. “You need to follow a process which is reviews, experts, professional staff of FDA and all of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333144730702139397/" target="_blank"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that HHS’s “bad administrative procedure” in announcing the updated CDC recommendations “will be an issue” if they’re challenged in court.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000p3b6m2s1n5p4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Would Pfizer consider filing a lawsuit?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “My initial reaction is that I would prefer to find solutions but not create tensions,” Bourla replied. “But of course, if we feel that we have to, we will.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000r3b6m958kgk4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the CEO emphasized that he has found the administration willing to engage in discussions, noting that “we maintain a very, very close relationship” with the White House.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb7m5ry000s3b6mkxvvrj26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t complain they don’t listen to us,” Bourla said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The number of outbreaks remained at 14, and 90% of cases are linked to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of patients (96%) are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and affected patients are roughly evenly split between kids younger than 5 years old, school-age children, and adults ages 20 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a related development, the CDC this week updated its &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe"&gt;measles travel advisory&lt;/a&gt;, noting that measles cases are rising in many countries and that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants ages 6 to 11 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;West Texas total grows by 9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS)&lt;/a&gt; today reported 9 more cases in the West Texas outbreak, putting the total since January at 738. Though 35 counties have reported cases linked to the outbreak, only 7 still have ongoing transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other states, Texas also continues to record measles cases from various sources that apparently aren't linked to the larger outbreak, and today officials reported 8 more such infections, lifting that total to 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few other states have reported cases linked to West Texas activity, but no new illnesses were reported in New Mexico or Oklahoma. On May 28, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; reported a total of 64 cases from 11 counties, 59 of them linked to an outbreak in the southwestern part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Colorado cluster tied to Turkish Airlines flight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/measles-case-confirmed-in-colorado-adult-with-recent-international-travel"&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE)&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday that it and partners in Arapahoe County have now confirmed three measles cases in people who were on the same Turkish Airlines flight that arrived in Denver on May 13. The latest patient is a vaccinated Arapahoe County adult, and the two earlier announced cases involved an out-of-state traveler who was infectious on the flight and an Arapahoe County child who was likely exposed on the flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly infectious and can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montana health officials reported a second measles case in &lt;a href="https://flatheadcounty.gov/application/files/4417/4855/4730/Flathead_County_Measles_Press_Release_5.29.2025_002.pdf"&gt;Flathead County&lt;/a&gt;, a person who had traveled outside the state. Also, the health department in &lt;a href="https://www.healthygallatin.org/community-health/communicable-diseases/measles/"&gt;Gallatin County&lt;/a&gt; has now reported 2 community cases, beyond an earlier family cluster, putting the total at 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Michigan, the &lt;a href="https://cms4files.revize.com/marquettemi/HealthDept/NewsRelease/PressReleaseMeaslesMQT.pdf"&gt;Marquette County Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, located in the Upper Peninsula, reported a case in a local resident, noting that it was working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women,” Professor Olynyk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the genetic variant itself cannot be changed, the brain pathways which it affects – leading to the damage that causes dementia – could potentially be treated if we understood more about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Olynyk said further research was needed to investigate why this genetic variant increased the risk of dementia for males but not females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt; gene is routinely tested for in most Western countries including Australia when assessing people for haemochromatosis – a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. Our findings suggest that perhaps this testing could be offered to men more broadly,” Professor Olynyk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the &lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt; gene is critical for controlling iron levels in the body, we found no direct link between iron levels in the blood and increased dementia risk in affected men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This points to other mechanisms at play, possibly involving the increased risk of brain injury from inflammation and cell damage in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Professor Paul Lacaze, from Monash University, said the findings could help improve outcomes for people at risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More than 400,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, with around a third of those being men. Understanding why men with the double H63D variant are at higher risk could pave the way for more personalised approaches to prevention and treatment,” Professor Lacaze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is a great example of how diverse Australian research groups and universities can collaborate effectively to learn more about these progressive diseases and ultimately improve health outcomes for people around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPREE trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily low-aspirin in 19,114 healthy older people in Australia and the USA. Primarily undertaken to evaluate the risks versus benefits of daily low-dose aspirin in this cohort, it created a treasure trove of healthy ageing data that has underpinned a wealth of research studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was a collaboration between Curtin University, Monash University, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Children’s Hospital, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and Fiona Stanley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1b8a0b2aca8afa4efb1a9a8adada8b1b281a2b4b3b5a8afefa4a5b4efa0b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yasmine Phillips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://curtin.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Curtin University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yasmine Phillips – Curtin University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Haemochromatosis genotypes and incident dementia in a prospective study of older adults&lt;/a&gt;” by John Olynyk et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haemochromatosis genotypes and incident dementia in a prospective study of older adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants in the homeostatic iron regulator (&lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt;) gene are prevalent among individuals of European ancestry and have been linked to an increased risk of dementia. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of &lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt; p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp variants on serum ferritin levels and the incidence of dementia in a cohort of initially healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Method&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prospective longitudinal study used data from the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly trial. Participants had no history of cardiovascular disease, dementia, or cognitive decline at enrollment. Genotyping for &lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt; p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp variants was conducted using microarrays, and baseline serum ferritin concentrations were measured in peripheral blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia diagnoses were confirmed by an adjudication committee over a median follow-up of 6.4 years. Associations were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for related covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 12,174 unrelated, healthy participants of European ancestry aged 70 years or older, comprising 5,583 men (45.9%) and 6,591 women (54.1%). The median age was 73.7 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 71.6–76.9) for men and 73.9 years (IQR: 71.7–77.5) for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the wild-type group, men with p.Cys282Tyr+/+ (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.048) and p.Cys282Tyr+/p.His63Asp + genotypes (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) had significantly higher baseline ferritin levels. Women with p.His63Asp+/+ (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.015) and p.Cys282Tyr+/p.His63Asp+ (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) genotypes also exhibited elevated ferritin levels. No significant association was observed between baseline serum ferritin levels and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, men with p.His63Asp+/+ genotype had a significantly higher risk of incident dementia (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.39, 95% CI 1.25–4.57, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) compared with those without &lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt; variations. This association was not observed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among initially healthy older adults, &lt;em&gt;HFE&lt;/em&gt; p.His63Asp homozygosity was associated with a higher risk of incident dementia in men but not women. These findings highlight a potential sex-specific genetic risk factor for dementia and warrant further research into the underlying mechanisms linking p.His63Asp and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 19:30:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5YUkJOT2IzbmRPR25wb3NYRk42Z0txSlBnLWxOLWQzX05hcXVEU3Bjc0JzdUI0ZGx5R2pNZndIUEw1VmdteFdSUFNDUlBvSnMtSzBQdFhzWEdJZkQ5bG9KSFhJOTcwZEV4</guid></item><item><title>没有人想要这些小婴儿，因为它们与众不同-渡渡鸟-为动物人而生 | Nobody Wanted These Tiny Babies Because They Were Born Different - The Dodo - For Animal People</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPbmhHSEtva1ZlWG5YYVhGdnBZQ284dkFwck5QSWhiVjN5bm5iLTREXy16cnVqY1A4b0ptQWlTenUwQ2JILTdRR29UQlRWV2p2S1lWeUp5dnFmVU9yamktNGQ5bmRmNGVWOXU0SnF2blFiem9wclJZSE5aQTQ2elpBUDM1WmlFeEg0R01TSTZlaU8zajE3a1lBX3c2RVlWTzZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="NodeArticlestyles__ObscuredContentWrapper-sc-1rwhog1-6 eCcsQv"&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="0"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;A few months ago, Kelly Sayer got a call from a vet office about two French bulldog puppies with cleft palates who needed a safe place to stay. Without hesitation, Sayer, who frequently fosters Frenchie pups, agreed to take them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;The puppies, named Violet and Dash, were both just 1 day old and so small that they could fit in the palm of Sayer’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="2"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;“[T]hey were tiny,” Sayer told The Dodo. “They were 5 and 6 ounces.

His father, Norman, was a physician who ran a family practice and his mother Edythe ran scheduling at the practice, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share"&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Growing up, he was a “tinkerer” who planned to study architecture but turned his interest to medicine after his father survived an aortic aneurysm, the Times obitury said. Norman Jarvik later died of a second aortic aneurysm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jarvik attended Syracuse University before studying medicine for two years at Italy’s University of Bologna. Jarvik received a master’s degree in occupational biomechanics from New York University and then moved to the University of Utah in 1971 where he completed a medical degree in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jarvik did not follow the traditional medical career path of internship and residency, because he was more interested in developing an artificial heart, per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share"&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He married Vos Savant in 1985, who survives him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jarvik had two children, Kate Jarvik Birch and Tyler Jarvik, from his marriage to playwright and former Deseret News journalist Elaine Levin Jarvik, to whom he was married from 1968 to 1985. Vos Savant also has two children from a previous relationship, Mary Blinder and Dennis Younglove.

One of them, in 1982, was implanted in a cow named Alfred Lord Tennyson, who survived for 268 days, setting a record for an animal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It was in 1982 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave permission to the University of Utah to implant a permanent artificial heart in a human. On Dec. 2, 1982, Dr. William C. DeVries led the surgical team that implanted the Jarvik-7 model in Barney Clark, a 61-year-old retired dentist. To encourage excellent work, Kolff put a student’s name on a version of the heart to which they’d made a significant alteration, which is how the heart became the Jarvik-7, as &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/2007/11/25/20055556/82-heart-implant-sparked-progress/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/2007/11/25/20055556/82-heart-implant-sparked-progress/"&gt;Deseret News reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The surgery to implant the Jarvik-7, made of aluminum and plastic, lasted seven hours and afterwards Clark told his wife, “I want to tell you even though I have no heart, I still love you,” per the &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2012/12/first-artificial-heart-30-years-later" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2012/12/first-artificial-heart-30-years-later"&gt;University of Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Clark survived 112 days attached to a 400-pound air compressor — roughly the size of a dishwasher — which helped the Jarvik-7 pump blood through his body. He never left the hospital and the complications included seizures, kidney failure and a broken valve on the artificial heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Clark died on March 23, 1983, of complications of a bacterial infection of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The second and third patient lived 620 days and 488 days, respectively, after receiving the experimental heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share"&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/a&gt; their survival showed that people “could live long term on the plastic and metal device,” but that the complications the recipients suffered “impaired the quality of their lives and blunted initial enthusiasm for the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Reporters from all over flocked to University of Utah hospital to cover the artificial heart. The news was celebrated by some, criticized by others. “By the mid-1980s, medical ethicists and theologians were debating whether artificial hearts improved life or extended a painful decline toward death,” per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share"&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Jarvik-7 was implanted in five patients as a permanent artificial heart and used hundreds of times as a temporary implant as patients waited for a donor heart. The FDA withdrew approval in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Jarvik's-legacy" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Jarvik’s legacy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2018, Jarvik was honored by United Business Media for Lifetime Achievement, according to &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/press-releases/2018/06/former-university-of-utah-inventor-robert-jarvik-receives-lifetime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://healthcare.utah.edu/press-releases/2018/06/former-university-of-utah-inventor-robert-jarvik-receives-lifetime"&gt;The University of Utah.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;After leading Symbion, Inc., which was based in Salt Lake City, Jarvik founded Jarvik Heart, Inc. in 1987, based in New York. The company developed smaller, less obtrusive ventricular assist devices that helped pump blood from the heart’s lower chambers to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Jarvik 2000 is around the size of a C battery and its pediatric version, the Jarvik 2015, is about the size of a AA battery, per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/science/robert-jarvik-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LE8.b3LG.CpHlCFeDT0_a&amp;amp;smid=em-share"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 18:51:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOT0lPY19NZlppQzZNcURDNVo5bkVTd0RJd0dkeXJTVGN2aEMtZWxHS0JUYnJKdEkyZ1lqOUxvUG5jcVdEQU1mbFF3aWNPcDBZVmEySGNtdjlrWjEyTndDandweXVUOHpRYXlodFNGeTVGMjJzSkNCQ0NFd2ROdGdpd1N6OVpXMFhBamJwZg</guid></item><item><title>报告称，旧金山热门汉堡店因虫害而关闭- SFGATE | Popular SF burger spot closes due to vermin infestation, report says - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPRVY4UGdYR3J3V2lsall6cVFQdXZrQnZYU3Eyb0ZYNk5kdTh6N29pMFBSRHZzX1EwQ3VfeWxzby1zWGtZS3FWbGpPUi1wX0ZTbTVwRWNnakc3Qk9MZzRqN212VzVodWM5VVRfY3E2Yk8wMU92cmd5cVVSU0JhNGhhX0t0MmtaODIza0haMHJJcV9UY1kzVmlfNDJOWm1udw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of kids dream of one day being firefighters, astronauts, doctors, or pro athletes. Top White House health adviser Calley Means, it seems, had a different dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From as long as I could remember, I was going to change public policy in the United States,” Means said in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhZDZc47OuM"&gt;2023 video interview&lt;/a&gt; with the conservative media organization PragerU. “That was my obsession growing up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obsession has become a reality as Means, 39, has gone from being a frequent podcast guest urging a shakeup of the country’s health and nutrition systems to being one of the most powerful and influential health policymakers in the federal government. As a key figure in the Make America Healthy Again movement, he’s part of a vanguard of outsider activists challenging the Washington health establishment. (That movement also includes his sister Casey, a Stanford-educated doctor who quit her residency after becoming disillusioned with the mainstream medical system. She’s now &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-surgeon-general-laura-loomer-794da62da02d5699683e3b1540b8a31f"&gt;the nominee for U.S. surgeon general&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like so many of those empowered by Donald Trump to disrupt the expert class, Means comes from the same world of those he’s looking to supplant: elite universities, a stint in Washington on his résume, and a presumption that the tools of government can solve problems if only placed in the right hands. And right now, incredibly, the health care tools have been placed in Means’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps none of this should be a surprise. Means grew up in Washington, the son of a former Nixon and Ford administration aide who later became an executive in the consulting business. After graduating from Stanford and beginning his career working in public affairs consulting—more on that in a bit—the younger Means attended Harvard Business School, graduating with an MBA in 2015. For a few years, Means worked in the Bay Area for a software company before launching a start-up with his wife that sold customized wedding dresses. They &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/davids-bridal-acquires-custom-wedding-dress-startup-anomalie/623973/"&gt;sold the startup to David’s Bridal in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Means family suffered tragedy in 2021 when their mother, Gayle, died soon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In Calley Means’ telling, her death was a moment that “&lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1790540500031971585?lang=en"&gt;put all the pieces together&lt;/a&gt;” for him about the country’s overarching health crisis. In short: The medical, pharmaceutical, and food industries are all incentivized by government and market forces to keep Americans sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are being lied to that cancer is random, that dementia is random, that kidney disease is random, that all these issues that are killing us are random. They’re not,” Means said in that PragerU video. “They’re all exploding, and they’re all tied, essentially, to food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from this dubious and reductive premise,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the two siblings embarked on a media- and business-based partnership advancing their belief in alternative medicine. Since quitting her residency, Casey Means opened her own nontraditional medical practice focused on “functional medicine.” (Her medical license in Oregon, where she did her residency, is &lt;a href="https://omb.oregon.gov/Clients/ORMB/Public/VerificationDetails.aspx?EntityID=1530903"&gt;currently inactive&lt;/a&gt; and expires at the end of this year.)  Calley, meanwhile, started his own company, TrueMed, that aims to help customers pay for everything from gym memberships to “wellness” products like supplements with pre-tax funds from health savings accounts and flexible savings accounts. They wrote a bestselling book together, &lt;em&gt;Good Energy&lt;/em&gt;, that purports to identify the root cause of practically every disease and health condition: bad metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair became frequent guests on television, podcasts, and (most importantly) on Tucker Carlson’s post-Fox News online talk show, offering both personal stories of their encounters with America’s supposedly misguided medical and nutritional establishment and an enticing pitch that the fix for the country’s health problems is a “simple” change in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To establish his authority on the subject, Means is often introduced as a former D.C.-based lobbyist for some of the companies and industries that benefit from the status quo. (He himself is more careful, usually more accurately referring to himself as working in public affairs.) Much like his sister becoming jaded by the practices of mainstream medicine, Means tells a story about coming to grips with the ugliness of &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1744541823450968461"&gt;manipulating studies&lt;/a&gt; to craft public relations campaigns for the pharmaceutical and beverage industry groups. The subtext of his current activist and policymaking phase is that Means is seeking redemption for all the wrongs he committed during his K Street years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others who knew Means from this time in his life—when he worked first at the firm Mercury and later the PR giant Edelman—say he was a relatively junior staffer, working on accounts for the American Beverage Association or Bayer but hardly a decisionmaker on strategy. (Those who knew him then requested anonymity in no small part thanks to Means’ penchant for &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1611053771848847361"&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; accusing his critics and opponents of &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1882810044619616707"&gt;being paid off&lt;/a&gt; by corporate interests.) And for whatever misgivings Means has about his time working for these clients, it hasn’t stopped him from &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/calley-means-a29b5512/"&gt;boasting on his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; that the accounts he worked on “often ran at 40%+ profit margin and highest client satisfaction.” The White House did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of those details, Means tells a good story for podcast audiences looking for confirmation that the powerful are inherently corrupt. In his appearances, Means seems to have answers for questions on issues as divergent as how we treat dementia (poorly) to the approval of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic (he’s against them). Means’ overarching heuristic? If it’s the accepted consensus of the experts, it’s been influenced by bad motives and it’s probably wrong. “We need to break free from the incentives of a medical and food system that is highly incentivized for us to be addicted to cheap and dangerous food, and sicker for longer periods of time,” he said in the PragerU video. “We need to listen to ourselves, do our own research, and not listen to the experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8"&gt;February 2024&lt;/a&gt; appearance with Carlson, Means caught the attention of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The two met soon after at an event for Kennedy’s presidential campaign in Austin. Means would later reveal on another podcast—&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lTyhvOeJs"&gt;Joe Rogan’s, of course&lt;/a&gt;—of what transpired in the portable sauna where he and Kennedy sat and talked. “Actually, it sounds very woo-woo, but I was in a sweat tent with him in Austin at a campaign event,” Means said. “I just had this strong vision of him standing with Trump and how what RFK represents is actually what Trump represents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Means became close with Kennedy, advising him on his campaign and later brokering the meeting between him and Trump that led to the Democrat-turned-independent dropping out of the race and endorsing the Republican nominee. Means was suddenly a major political player, helping forge an alliance between MAGA and MAHA that may have helped deliver the White House to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Means officially joined the administration as a White House health adviser in March, and it’s clear his viewpoint holds a lot of sway in Trump’s Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;another episode&lt;/a&gt; of Carlson’s online show last year, the former Fox News host asked Means what he would do if he were president. “Day one: state of emergency for childhood chronic disease,” Means said. “What’s happening in childhood chronic disease is a much-orders-of-magnitude bigger state of emergency right now and more imminent emergency in America than COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn’t happen on day one exactly, but it sounds awfully similar to what President Trump established through &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt;an executive order in February&lt;/a&gt;: a commission, headed by Kennedy, charged with “investigating and addressing the root causes of America’s escalating health crisis, with an initial focus on childhood chronic diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Means didn’t just inspire the commission; by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/rfk-jr-pesticides-agriculture-d23ae280?mod=hp_lead_pos1"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/well/calley-means-maha.html"&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt;, he was deeply involved in its recently released, 72-page &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf"&gt;“Make Our Children Healthy Again”&lt;/a&gt; assessment. The report lays out a case for what is causing chronic diseases in children, targeting everything from processed foods and pesticides to overmedication and overexposure to screens. (But as &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTUS&lt;/em&gt; reported this week&lt;/a&gt;, the report has some issues, including the fact that several of the academic studies cited in footnotes don’t seem to, erm, exist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the throughline of the report is also a throughline in Means’ own thinking: America’s health is being held hostage by the profit motive of the pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries, which not only lobby the federal government to protect their interests but infiltrate the institutions of society to reinforce their market position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s not get conspiratorial,” Means said during an appearance last year on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pniS7YmoJk"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Skinny Confidential &lt;/em&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Let’s just be very specific: The food industry wants our food to be addictive and cheap, and the health care industry, just as a statement of economic fact, they want people to be sicker for longer periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Means has quickly ascended by performing as an insider uncovering the sinister motivations of his one-time peers, he also tries to work the system to his benefit.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It was just last year that Means was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2024/06/27/wellness-execs-pitch-their-industry-to-address-chronic-disease-00165440"&gt;heading up&lt;/a&gt; his own united coalition called End Chronic Disease that included the leaders of companies like exercise brand CrossFit and health supplement company AG1. This lobbying effort aimed to push back on &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-alert-beware-of-companies-misrepresenting-nutrition-wellness-and-general-health-expenses-as-medical-care-for-fsas-hsas-hras-and-msas"&gt;the IRS crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on people using their pre-tax health care dollars to buy these products, a direct threat to Means’ company TrueMed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of his company’s competitors in the wellness space has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/calley-means-wellness-ethics-complaint-hhs-00342230"&gt;filed an ethics complaint against Means&lt;/a&gt;. The complaint alleges that Means has used his position in the Trump administration to threaten the CEO of the Wellness Company, Peter Gillooly, after he accused Gillooly of leaking false information about TrueMed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one more thing happens, I’m going to go to [National Institutes of Health director] Jay Bhattacharya and Bobby [Kennedy] and tell him that you and your cadre … are spreading lies and trying to f— with him and hurt his administration,” Means said in a phone call with Gillooly, who says Means’ actions represent a conflict of interest. Means has pushed back, telling &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; he was merely threatening legal action against someone he believed to be spreading false information about his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lobbying for special favors, vague lawsuit threats, a fight spilling out in Washington’s premier trade publication—there’s no doubt that Means remains an insider, through and through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that vitamin D3 may slow cellular aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D3 supplements helped preserved telomeres, small caps that protect your DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should speak to a healthcare professional before starting a vitamin D supplement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ve probably heard that things like gray hair, wrinkles or brain fog are signs of aging—but deep inside your cells, a different kind of aging is happening as your telomeres slowly shrink with every passing year. Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of your DNA, and they help keep your cells stable every time they divide. Shorter telomeres have been linked to a higher risk of age-related diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now, new research offers a compelling insight into how we might help slow that biological clock.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A randomized controlled trial, published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that supplementing with vitamin D3 may help preserve telomere length, potentially protecting your DNA from premature aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The findings come from the landmark VITAL study, one of the largest and longest-running trials of its kind, and they add to the growing body of research linking vitamin D to healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this new study, researchers found that participants who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily had significantly less telomere shortening over four years compared to those who took a placebo. While vitamin D is already known for supporting bone health and immune function, this study suggests it could also play a role in keeping your cells—and perhaps even your entire body—healthier for longer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This research was part of the VITAL trial, a large, long-term randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study based in the United States. VITAL originally followed over 25,000 adults—women aged 55 and older and men aged 50 and older—over five years to investigate the health effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A subset of 1,054 participants joined a telomere sub-study. Researchers measured the length of participants’ telomeres (in white blood cells) at the start of the study, then again at years two and four. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a daily supplement of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3, 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids, both or a placebo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Compared to those taking a placebo, participants who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 each day experienced significantly less telomere shortening over four years. In fact, the difference was equivalent to preventing nearly three years’ worth of biological aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, omega-3 supplements did not have a measurable impact on telomere length.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres,” said study co-author JoAnn Manson in a press release. These results align with other VITAL findings that suggest vitamin D may help reduce inflammation and lower risk for chronic conditions like advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While telomere shortening is a normal part of aging, accelerated shortening is linked to increased risk of age-related diseases. That’s why interventions that preserve telomere length are being studied as ways to promote healthier aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one has its limitations. In particular, the majority of the participants were hispanic and white, which makes it difficult to generalize these findings across other racial or ethnic groups. Additionally, since this study analyzes data from another study, the researchers note that their conclusions should be considered as hypotheses more than firm conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is known to play a vital role in supporting immune health, bone strength and, according to this new research, potentially cellular aging. Yet many people aren't getting enough of it. In fact, the &lt;em&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/em&gt; lists vitamin D as a "nutrient of concern" because so many adults fall short of the recommended intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our bodies can make vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight—specifically, UVB rays. But if you live in a northern climate, spend most of your time indoors, use sunscreen diligently or have darker skin (which reduces vitamin D synthesis), you may not be making enough. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And since few foods naturally contain vitamin D—though fish-liver oils, fatty fish like salmon or mackerel, mushrooms exposed to sunlight, egg yolks and liver are exceptions—it can be tough to meet your needs through food alone. That’s where supplements can come in. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The standard recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 600 IU per day up to age 70 and 800 IU per day for those over 70.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this study used a significantly higher dose—2,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily. If you're considering adding a supplement to your routine, especially at doses above the RDA, it’s important to talk to a healthcare provider first. They may recommend checking your blood levels of vitamin D to guide next steps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While more research is needed to confirm exactly who benefits most from vitamin D supplementation, this study adds to the growing evidence that getting enough of this nutrient may be a meaningful way to support healthy aging. It’s another reason to get outdoors &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8040993/is-salmon-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;and eat more salmon&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study from the VITAL trial found that taking 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily helped preserve telomere length over four years, potentially slowing biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, Ph.D., one of the study authors, in a press release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re thinking about increasing your vitamin D intake, talk with a trusted healthcare provider to find the right approach for you.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new Covid-19 variant fueling a global rise in cases has been detected in Washington, but health officials aren’t too concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the variant in a sample collected May 15 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the state Department of Health. As of Thursday morning, that’s been the only case confirmed in Washington, and it’s unclear whether the May 15 case was in a state resident or a visitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was found through the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traveler-genomic-surveillance/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance &lt;/a&gt;that detects Covid through voluntary nasal swabs and wastewater samples at a number of American airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/five-years-later-looking-back-on-covid-in-seattle" target="_blank"&gt;Photos: A look back at Covid in Seattle, 5 years later&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is one of a handful of states where a case has been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As its prevalence has grown quickly around the world, the World Health Organization has designated the new variant, NB.1.8.1, as one “&lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;.” NB.1.8.1 is fueling a spike in infections and hospitalizations in China, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the organization believes the variant doesn’t lead to more severe illness than current versions of the virus. Local health officials agree. “In general, I think that there’s low concern,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer with the state Department of Health. “But I think with any new variants, we really do need to monitor them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current vaccines are expected to remain effective against NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new variant comes as the Trump administration has shifted vaccination guidelines. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the CDC would no longer recommend the Covid vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. The Trump administration has also limited eligibility for the vaccine, holding it should only be given to people over 65 or those with risk factors from other medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: RFK&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/rfk-jr-says-covid-shots-no-longer-recommended-for-kids-pregnant-women" target="_blank"&gt;Jr. says Covid shots no longer recommended for kids, pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;









  &lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would require new testing to prove the shots are effective for younger people. Critics see these moves as unnecessary and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than one in five Washingtonians received a Covid vaccine booster this season, according to &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/data-statistical-reports/health-behaviors/immunization/covid-19-vaccination-data" target="_blank"&gt;state data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published by the &lt;a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/new-covid-variant-found-in-washington/" target="_blank"&gt;Washington State Standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

that contain 20–30% DEET” or picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus and IR3535.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property owners are urged to make sure screens are intact, doors are left closed and to remove standing water that may encourage mosquitoes to breed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andre Seale/VW PICS/Universal Images Group via Getty&lt;/p&gt;

species of mosquitos that carry the Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HDOH said they’ve dispatched "vector control teams" to the areas of most concern, which include including Waialua and the popular surfer destination of Haleʻiwa on the North Shore of Oʻahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island is home to nearly 1 million residents, and is the location of popular destinations like &lt;a href="https://people.com/2-killed-after-plane-crashes-into-building-near-honolulu-airport-during-training-flight-8763667" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Honolulu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://people.com/hawaii-imposes-the-nation-first-climate-change-tax-for-tourists-11745042" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Waikiki;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Waikiki&lt;/a&gt;

They light up radio telescopes and serve as mileposts for how black holes shape the cosmos. Yet beyond a certain distance, the faint signals drown in the microwave hiss left by the Big Bang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have long suspected that many early galaxies carried such jets, but, until recently, even the most sensitive instruments came up empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hurdle has now been cleared. A newly analyzed radio image reveals twin lobes stretching roughly 66,000 light-years on each side of a quasar called J1601+3102. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-space-radio-burst-frb-20220610a-reaches-earth-after-8-billion-year-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;radio waves&lt;/a&gt; began their trip across space more than 12.1 billion years ago, the observation shows the quasar as it was when the universe had completed only about nine percent of its history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quasar-j1601-3102"&gt;Quasar J1601+3102&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-galaxy-collision-reveals-a-quasar-shutting-down-star-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quasar&lt;/a&gt;, J1601+3102, belongs to a youthful universe – it flared into view when the cosmos was less than 1.2 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at that early date, its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/milky-ways-black-hole-unleashes-mysterious-flares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;central black hole&lt;/a&gt; weighed about 450 million suns, enough to pull in gas and dust that heat up and blast out radiation across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fast-radio-burst-frb-20240209a-detected-from-dead-galaxy-should-not-be-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Most radio jets&lt;/a&gt; this far away fade before they reach our antennas. The new image, taken with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), reveals a structure that spans nearly 200,000 light-years – about twice the Milky Way’s diameter – when both lobes are measured end to end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer length hints at a sustained engine that kept pumping material well after the first stars lit the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were searching for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hubble-took-the-closest-ever-image-of-a-quasar-and-captured-some-weird-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quasars&lt;/a&gt; with strong radio jets in the early universe, which helps us understand how and when the first jets are formed and how they impact the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/image/hundreds-of-galaxies-illuminate-the-early-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evolution of galaxies&lt;/a&gt;,” says Anniek Gloudemans, postdoctoral research fellow at &lt;a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NOIRLab&lt;/a&gt; and lead author of the study describing the find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lofar-provides-unusual-clarity"&gt;LOFAR provides unusual clarity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.astron.nl/telescopes/lofar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LOFAR&lt;/a&gt; links more than 50 stations from Ireland to Poland, turning Europe into one giant dish that excels at picking up long-wavelength radio waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At those frequencies, even tenuous clouds of electrons glow, so the array can trace the full length of a jet instead of only its bright knots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we started looking at this object, we expected the southern jet to be just an unrelated nearby source, and for most of it to be small. That made it quite surprising when the LOFAR image revealed large, detailed radio structures,” says Frits Sweijen, postdoctoral research associate at &lt;a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Durham University&lt;/a&gt; and co-author of the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The nature of this distant source makes it difficult to detect at higher radio frequencies, demonstrating the power of LOFAR on its own and its synergies with other instruments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teamwork-across-wavelengths"&gt;Teamwork across wavelengths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill in the picture, the researchers tapped infrared data from the &lt;a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/gemini-observatory/gemini-north/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gemini North telescope&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaiʻi and optical spectra from the &lt;a href="https://mcdonaldobservatory.org/research/telescopes/HET" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hobby Eberly Telescope&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations located the magnesium emission line that reveals how fast matter spirals toward the black hole and how fast the entire galaxy is receding because of cosmic expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/02/30094555/black-hole-jet_largest-seen_J1601-3102_telescope-combinations_credit-NOIRLab_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/02/30094603/black-hole-jet_largest-seen_J1601-3102_telescope-combinations_credit-NOIRLab_1s.webp" alt="Using a combination of telescopes, astronomers have discovered the largest radio jet ever found in the early universe, J1601+3102.

Only an unusually powerful jet can pierce that fog, which explains why examples have been scarce until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-it-all-mean"&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each newly spotted jet gives astronomers a fresh line of evidence for how black holes sculpt their host galaxies. By blasting gas out of the center, a jet can slow star formation or, by stirring gas at the edges, trigger more of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of J1601+3102 shows that this give-and-take was already under way when the universe was young, shaping the galaxies we see today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More sensitive radio surveys and next-generation infrared telescopes promise to find dozens of similar objects in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each will carry a message from a time when space was only dimly lit, telling us how a modest black hole could launch a jet big enough to stretch across three Milky Ways and survive a 12-billion-year journey to our backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad9609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image Credit: NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/M.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hazardous air pollutant has been leaking from the Delaware City Refinery for several days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Monday morning, an &lt;a href="https://derns.dnrec.delaware.gov/Pub/ReleaseDetail.aspx?ReleaseID=2025-0995"&gt;alert sent through Delaware’s Environmental Release Notification System&lt;/a&gt; described a “mechanical issue” that started late Sunday night, causing the release of several chemicals into the air, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen cyanide, noted as “HCN.” The report said repairs “were being made.”
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A similar report the next day described the incident as a “boiler issue” that caused a larger release of sulfur dioxide, and repeated that “repairs are being made to the boiler.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-week, the issue had apparently worsened, with a &lt;a href="https://derns.dnrec.delaware.gov/Pub/ReleaseDetail.aspx?ReleaseID=2025-1010"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday morning describing a “boiler failure” and a release of sulfur dioxide at a rate of 500 pounds per hour. The release of sulfur dioxide grew to a &lt;a href="https://derns.dnrec.delaware.gov/Pub/ReleaseDetail.aspx?ReleaseID=2025-1016"&gt;rate of 1,450 pounds per hour by Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt;, according to the notification system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The release will continue until repairs are made,” Thursday’s notification read.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulfur dioxide can be &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts116.pdf"&gt;life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; when breathed in at very high concentrations, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At lower concentrations, it can cause &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/humanhealth-sulfur.htm"&gt;irritation, coughing and breathing difficulties&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for people with lung conditions like asthma. Sulfur dioxide can also react with other compounds in the air to create small particles that exacerbate lung conditions and can &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/air-research/air-pollution-and-cardiovascular-disease-basics#:~:text=Who%20is%20at%20increased%20risk,Older%20adults"&gt;trigger heart attacks for people with cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Sulfur dioxide also contributes to the formation of acid rain in the atmosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports in Delaware’s Environmental Release Notification System mark the release as “extremely hazardous,” and say the chemical “may cause death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports do not specify whether workers or people living or working near the site could be exposed. They indicate that the public was notified, but that no precautions were recommended.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age was 77 and about 52 percent were men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then made population estimates based on US Census data from 2014 to 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using death certificate and census data, the team set an expected cardiac death rate for 2020 to 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found cardiac deaths were 16 percent higher than expected in 2020, 17 percent higher in 2021 and 2022 and six percent higher in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amount of monthly cardiac deaths at home also exceeded expected levels between 2020 and 2022 and in hospitals between 2020 and 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cited additional data showing heart attack hospitalizations decreased by 20 to 34 percent after the start of the pandemic. This suggests many of these excess deaths occurred at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'In this population-based cohort study of Massachusetts decedents, we found cardiac deaths increased substantially starting in 2020, with exaggerated seasonal patterns and increases in deaths at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While numerous other studies have found fewer admissions for cardiac emergencies in countries across the world, these studies may have missed events occurring outside of hospitals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggested this increase could be due to more people avoiding hospitals during the pandemic or being dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a4.htm"&gt;research from 2020&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found 40 percent of Americans delayed or avoided seeking medical care at the start of the pandemic, and 12 percent stayed away from emergency rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, emerging research also shows the Covid virus itself may cause long-term heart issues, increasing the risk of cardiac deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burke went into cardiac arrest at 21 years old while cheering at the University of Houston.

Our findings suggest that both patient choices about seeking care and outcomes after experiencing a cardiac emergency also have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Had we not examined mortality using death certificate data, the increases in population cardiac mortality could have gone unnoticed.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including the lack of data on the causes leading to cardiac death. It's unclear when the full findings will be released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Her work extends far beyond traditional gene identification, employing innovative approaches that bridge multiple scientific disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am absolutely amazed at how much we can already learn about the biological pathways and brain-cellular substrates underlying psychiatric conditions using data science methods,” she notes, while emphasizing the indispensable role of experimental validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Bridges Across Disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Franke’s leadership in founding multiple international research consortia, including the International Multicentre persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) and the ECNP Network ADHD across the lifespan, demonstrates her commitment to collaborative science. As a founding member of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), she recognized early that advancing psychiatric genetics required unprecedented international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research philosophy combines cutting-edge bioinformatics with experimental models ranging from fruit flies to human induced pluripotent stem cells. This multifaceted approach raises intriguing questions about how genetic variations translate into behavioral differences and whether understanding these mechanisms could lead to more personalized treatments for neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Vision for Psychiatric Classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently heading the Medical Neuroscience department at Radboud University Medical Center, Professor Franke harbors ambitious goals. “We still need a new nosology in psychiatry, and I want to contribute to that by identifying genes and pathways,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recent venture into epigenetics research explores how environmental factors interact with genetic predispositions, potentially unlocking new avenues for prevention and intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decorated Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion approaches her work with a philosophy captured by the German proverb she lives by: “Die Suppe wird nicht so heiß gegessen, wie sie gekocht wird” (“The soup is not eaten as hot as it is cooked”). This balanced perspective has enabled her to navigate complex scientific challenges while mentoring the next generation of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact Beyond the Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Franke’s influence extends beyond her scientific contributions. Her “jump first, think later” mentorship approach has empowered countless young scientists, particularly women, to seize opportunities in competitive research environments. This philosophy raises important questions about how scientific culture might evolve if more researchers embraced calculated risk-taking and rapid decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview reveals fascinating insights into Professor Franke’s recent move to epigenetics, using advanced single-cell resolution techniques to study DNA modifications and transcriptomes. These cutting-edge approaches could potentially identify biomarkers for treatment response or reveal critical windows for intervention during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As psychiatric conditions continue to affect millions worldwide, Professor Franke’s work offers hope for improved diagnosis and treatment. Her integration of molecular biology, neuroscience, and clinical psychiatry exemplifies the interdisciplinary approach needed to tackle complex brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question remains: How quickly can these biological insights translate into tangible improvements in patient care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6805090401461f07060f280f0d060705010b181a0d1b1b460b0705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/gp025k.0053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Understanding the biological pathways from genes to altered behaviour in neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD – paving the way for improved understanding and care in psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;” by Barbara Franke et al. &lt;em&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the biological pathways from genes to altered behaviour in neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD – paving the way for improved understanding and care in psychiatry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this Genomic Press Interview, Professor Barbara Franke, a trailblazing molecular psychiatrist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, shares her extraordinary scientific journey from an inquisitive child fascinated by nature to becoming one of the world’s most influential researchers in biological psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 500 peer-reviewed publications and recognition among the top 1% most cited scientists globally, Franke has helped to revolutionize our understanding of the genetic foundations of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing together international experts for interdisciplinary research, she founded and leads multiple international research consortia, including the International Multicentre persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) and the ECNP Network ADHD across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her pioneering work extends beyond gene identification to illuminating the biological pathways from genetic variations to altered behaviour, employing innovative complementary approaches including bioinformatics, brain imaging genetics, and experimental models using fruit flies and human induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, decorated Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and recipient of numerous prestigious awards, Franke’s scientific contributions are matched by her passionate commitment to international collaboration and mentorship of the next generation of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recent move into epigenetics research, investigating the interplay between heritable and environmental influences on psychiatric conditions, illustrates her unwavering determination to contribute to a new nosology in psychiatry that will ultimately improve diagnosis, treatment, and management for millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by the German proverb “Die Suppe wird nicht so heiß gegessen, wie sie gekocht wird” (“The soup is not eaten as hot as it is cooked”), Franke’s balanced approach to life and science continues to inspire groundbreaking advances at the intersection of genetics, neuroscience, and psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers highlight how maternal stress, caregiving quality, and early environmental cues influence the development of brain systems that regulate emotion and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early-life signals may prepare children for future adversity, but if the environment shifts, that preparation can backfire, leading to anxiety in adolescence. As social and technological landscapes change rapidly, the mismatch between early expectations and lived experiences may be amplifying mental health struggles among youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Prenatal stress and caregiving quality shape brain systems tied to emotional regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Mismatch:&lt;/strong&gt; Early-life cues may prime children for danger, causing anxiety if threats don’t materialize.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Lifespan-focused, preventative mental health strategies must start in early childhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a Perspective, Mark Hanson and Peter Gluckman explore how maternal stress, caregiving quality, and early environmental conditions can shape the development of executive functions and emotional regulation in children, and how these factors contribute to the emergence of anxiety disorders in young people. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence reveals a significant rise in anxiety disorders among adolescents ages 12 to 19, especially in developing countries like the United States, which cannot be fully explained by contemporary stressful events like the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern suggests that broader longer-term societal or developmental factors are driving the growing prevalence of adolescent anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Hanson and Gluckman highlight how environmental conditions in the earliest stages of life – beginning even before birth – can significantly shape a child’s developing brain, particularly the systems responsible for emotional regulation and executive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, these early cues may “prepare” children for adversity, but if the anticipated threats never fully materialize as they grow, such heightened emotional responses may lead to anxiety disorders, especially in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch is further compounded by the rapid and dynamic social and technological changes young people now face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Societies face an emerging burden of mental health issues, especially in young people. Although appropriate interventions are needed to help those already affected, preventative approaches are also critical,” write Hanson and Gluckman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Solutions will need to adopt a lifecourse perspective, involving more cohesive thinking about parental and caregiver support and the early childhood years by policymakers across health, education, and social welfare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed9e8e849d8c86ad8c8c8c9ec3829f8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Press Package Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aaas.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Science Press Package Team – AAAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp3764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Growing anxious–Are preschoolers matched to their futures?&lt;/a&gt;” by Mark A.

For example, over- or inappropriate expression of anxiety later in human life can turn out to be maladaptive, reducing an individual’s own or social functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps anxiety disorders can be understood as inappropriate socioemotional regulation in relation to actual, perceived, or anticipated challenges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:32:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE85MktnS25iTTdpWmJ6akpodVEyZGNQaTl5RjE1MXdpZjRvQldEN2pQd3loZURQU3ZGRUFzemFKa3o4STZWSHpLUXd4bkQ1SGk1cENnTmZKaWpmUXRfV285eG9Sdl9NLWVpSTUxZ1NXNmZzMGpqUEVMT3dZNA</guid></item><item><title>我在减肥刺拳中失去了五块石头......但是当你停下来时会发生什么，这是一个令人震惊的事实-每日邮报 | I lost five stone on a weight loss jab...but there's an alarming truth about what happens when you stop - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOQXhveDJ2VmREVTNmVnhobE5HdkJ1dW1IRG9vWUt4ZGNxMHBLWF9JTUxDTzA4N19CZ0NCX0FraEVkU25QNmxZeGJzWjAtTWZNUDJ6em5abmdjajlIVG9jRTNJeTV4c0d6Tnhmamtiem5oSlpsR2NiODFsSU1TVWtlTUNCajYwSmlLUGhLb3RiYVhMM05hZHRvbjVn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1pSXZxTThmRXBZR1psMmZreTJkV214ZUVuXzFxc0lJaFJRLWNhSFQ0ZmFvRzVXdDdXTHVjdEZxTlZVSk5iSWZEMTdzM0NZd3VBeVNqS3VMYWdHUjJDREVFTnJPb3BDczZZLUdpNUhndE9PSWR6UnpDd3dTeFpyUC1tNGgzcHNfLTVNZ1loNk1iU2xVZzBmaVUtODZMZWtHWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man who shed five stone in a year thanks to a skinny jab has told of how he fears he will have to be on the drug for life—after he regained half the weight in months when he tried to stop the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;John Kane, 76, from Dublin, weighed nearly 19 stone and plummeted to under 14 within a year of taking liraglutide in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liraglutide works in a similar way to semaglutide—the generic name for Ozempic—triggering the release of the hormone GLP-1 that makes us feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs, which he obtained privately, initially vastly improved Mr Kane's life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication helped get his type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-0bc3b200-3d5e-11f0-bd6f-35f6b9903e9d"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; into remission, and enjoy active social excursions that he couldn't before, including hikes in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/spain/index.html" id="mol-b6a42a30-3d52-11f0-8363-ade3523f848d" class=""&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the success, he decided to stop the injections in 2018 due to the eye-watering&lt;span&gt; £232 a month cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking to the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.ie/life/health-wellbeing/health-features/life-after-ozempic-half-the-weight-id-lost-i-put-back-on-over-six-months/a1602857534.html"&gt;Irish Independent&lt;/a&gt;, he said his raging appetite returned with a vengeance almost immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had really put a lot of effort into the last two years, and was determined not to put back on the weight,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Kane, 76, from Dublin, weighed nearly 19 stone and plummeted to under 14 within a year of taking liraglutide, a drug much like Ozempic—but says he gained half of it back in six months when he came off the jab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'But whether I liked it or not, even watching my food, the weight just started to creep back up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within six months, Mr Kane had regained half the weight he'd lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The major setback caused him to 'hit the rocks, mentally'. '&lt;span&gt;It was really affecting me,' he said. 'I’m not one to be depressed, but it really bit into me.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six months without the medicine, Mr Kane's wife suggested he 'bite the bullet' and pay for more injections, to stop the decline of his health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When semaglitude, better known as Ozempic, was rolled out at a cheaper cost of £118, it became a more affordable option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; He has now been on taking the medication for nearly eight years—a maintenance dose of 1mg a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has no plans to stop again and said if he were to ever come off he'd become a 'very sad, dejected, depressed person.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic have burst onto the scene in recent years, hailed as a potential fix for the UK's spiraling obesity crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Semaglutide mimics glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a naturally occurring hormone released in the small intestine when you eat. It tells your brain you're full and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After years of rigorous scientific trials, semaglutide has been chemically modified to last far longer than the body’s own, short-lived supply of GLP-1. As a result, it keeps people feeling fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US researchers at Cornell University in New York found those on the injections typically lost &lt;span&gt;lost around 13.7 per cent of their body weight, on average, over a 72-week period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But a study in the journal Epic Research found that 44 per cent of people who lost at least five pounds using semaglutide and then stopped the drug regained at least 25 per cent of their lost weight within a year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Emma Cunningham, an aesthetics expert who treats patients suffering cosmetic complications of Ozempic, said some choose to go on a maintenance dose and wean off the drug that way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t be solely reliant on the drug,' she said. 'You need to be using this as an opportunity to address your lifestyle. Our most successful patients will have really gotten on board with healthy eating and exercise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the jabs help people stay motivated to make a change to a healthy lifestyle because they are seeing rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's those who become completely reliant on the drug, and fail to make lifestyle changes, who end up putting the weight back on, Dr Cuningham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at Oxford University discovered the effects of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy are short-lived if patients do not maintain a healthy lifestyle afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even those taking newer, more powerful jabs drugs like Mounjaro put their weight back on once treatment was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,' said researcher Professor Susan Jebb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:26:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOQXhveDJ2VmREVTNmVnhobE5HdkJ1dW1IRG9vWUt4ZGNxMHBLWF9JTUxDTzA4N19CZ0NCX0FraEVkU25QNmxZeGJzWjAtTWZNUDJ6em5abmdjajlIVG9jRTNJeTV4c0d6Tnhmamtiem5oSlpsR2NiODFsSU1TVWtlTUNCajYwSmlLUGhLb3RiYVhMM05hZHRvbjVn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1pSXZxTThmRXBZR1psMmZreTJkV214ZUVuXzFxc0lJaFJRLWNhSFQ0ZmFvRzVXdDdXTHVjdEZxTlZVSk5iSWZEMTdzM0NZd3VBeVNqS3VMYWdHUjJDREVFTnJPb3BDczZZLUdpNUhndE9PSWR6UnpDd3dTeFpyUC1tNGgzcHNfLTVNZ1loNk1iU2xVZzBmaVUtODZMZWtHWQ</guid></item><item><title>报告发现，食物和健身在减肥药物方面取得了成功- ABC新闻 | Food and fitness make or break success on weight loss meds, report finds - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOR3lrX3ItNTNqVmpLYjE5ekNWaFB0eFF2dVh5MmFoaE9Pc0FMbGNlNVFqSDVnZVZPSVNCSGU4cUF0cVJtb0ZReFdndmZhSVlZUm53U3JpMjdvRnA3RlNocmhJS3dzdmp5WFJ4bUJmS3hxdkg2WkRXMGV4NDhlWUEzbHQ5VEJtOWxqdGNHSTNMN2ZSNzdJajJzUXpZVnZ5RUNuZmg3NXBR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE1BMERONFBDV0tMU0piVmZOSUptbXdHQ3cxZUZsQ0trdzAzWEZRX0NSQ0xfVTRwQTZEWnd2dUVUZTJJd0s4SS1oZmY2M01GZ2tyak9JWnlJWDJ0Z2E0ZjF6QnRHaHVsM0dLLTRUbXJVWDZUdGd6Q0xKMFlqUmhfWkZVQ2x1UGx0YlNFTDBqTkU4Y3BQMlRvbzZMNzBMa2dhRXJRRzUtNGltR2N5TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Drugs like &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/video/study-shows-wegovy-decreases-risk-heart-attacks-stroke-113320548" target="_blank"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;

"In fact, they are prescribed the other way around with lifestyle therapy being the adjunct if being thought about at all. Doctors are not following either society guidelines or FDA guidelines if they are prescribing [GLP-1s] without lifestyle therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Before starting GLP-1 medications, the report recommended that patients work with their doctors to set goals that focus on overall health, not just weight loss. It's also important to check for any stomach or bone issues that could lead to side effects like nausea, vomiting, or muscle and bone loss, the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Registered dietitians can play really key roles in comprehensive obesity care by providing medical nutrition therapy to support GLP-1 therapy," said Emily A. Callahan, registered dietitian nutritionist and director of policy strategy for the Food is Medicine Institute. "The evidence space is growing that shows when registered dietitians deliver medical nutrition therapy, it has been associated with improvements in body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and glycemic control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People should usually start GLP-1 medications at the lowest dose and slowly increase as needed, the report said. Patients should also be aware that nausea is common when taking these drugs and this may trigger cravings for sugary, high-calorie comfort foods that work against weight loss. To stay on track, the report recommended eating small, frequent meals and focusing on minimally processed, nutrient-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report called for exercising special caution for anyone following an intermittent fasting diet or a low-carbohydrate "keto diet" that limits foods like breads, pastas and fruit to put the body into a state called ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbs. These individuals might be especially vulnerable to gastrointestinal side effects, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also advised people who may not be getting enough nutrients to consider taking supplements like vitamin D, calcium and multivitamins, while increasing protein intake by 50-100% from foods such as fish, eggs, nuts and seeds. This is especially important for those eating less while on GLP-1s, since lower food intake can make it harder to get all the nutrients the body needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also underscored the importance of maintaining muscle mass and bone density while losing weight. Since weight loss can also lead to muscle loss -- especially in older adults -- the report advised doing a full body strength training routine at least three times a week and getting 150 minutes of moderate cardio each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Focusing on nutrition, physical activity and other healthy lifestyle habits should give GLP-1 users a greater chance of achieving their goals, the report concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"GLP-1s have the best chance of helping people achieve and sustain lasting weight reduction when they are paired with strong nutrition guidance and lifestyle support," said Callahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Brendan Huang serves as the chief resident physician in adult neurology at Northwell Health and is also a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:19:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOR3lrX3ItNTNqVmpLYjE5ekNWaFB0eFF2dVh5MmFoaE9Pc0FMbGNlNVFqSDVnZVZPSVNCSGU4cUF0cVJtb0ZReFdndmZhSVlZUm53U3JpMjdvRnA3RlNocmhJS3dzdmp5WFJ4bUJmS3hxdkg2WkRXMGV4NDhlWUEzbHQ5VEJtOWxqdGNHSTNMN2ZSNzdJajJzUXpZVnZ5RUNuZmg3NXBR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE1BMERONFBDV0tMU0piVmZOSUptbXdHQ3cxZUZsQ0trdzAzWEZRX0NSQ0xfVTRwQTZEWnd2dUVUZTJJd0s4SS1oZmY2M01GZ2tyak9JWnlJWDJ0Z2E0ZjF6QnRHaHVsM0dLLTRUbXJVWDZUdGd6Q0xKMFlqUmhfWkZVQ2x1UGx0YlNFTDBqTkU4Y3BQMlRvbzZMNzBMa2dhRXJRRzUtNGltR2N5TQ</guid></item><item><title>这只猫粪便寄生虫可以斩首精子-它可能会加剧不孕症- Gizmodo | This Cat Poop Parasite Can Decapitate Sperm—and It Might Be Fueling Infertility - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQNHVLVVYwTWo5TkE5REYtX1FPU0l4QmJRak5wZFhEZndhNmVYZXNtQU5uRTBMQlhDb2dFOVA1SGtTNzB1MFhVYTNUaVVnVC12dUlQblh2VFhTNW5qQXJHM2tvWnhMbmJyWS1wTWwxUm9LQTFvVTN4U3dQVWNNc3lyN1o2bnNZbmxUSHZQS29XU3NFUGowcXUxbE92dmE3R29NSjRnM1ktZnlienFuYnNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet, and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that “human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact” with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs. In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems. Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" alt="Microscopy image of translucent, two-layers circular blobs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; cysts floating in cat feces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html"&gt;DPDx Image Library/CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people. Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay, and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates. In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" alt="Series of microscopy images of slightly deformed sperm with holes in their heads"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Sperm exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;.

Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it’s likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite’s potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/bill-sullivan-703249"&gt;Bill Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/indiana-university-1368"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After a long week, Friday seems like the perfect time to order takeout and cozy up in front of the television to watch your favorite show. While dining out or ordering takeout are convenient ways to nourish yourself, it also means you have less control over the ingredients. And if you’re eating out on the regular, you may be overdoing it on calories, fat and sodium, which can lead to weight gain and inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on what you order, takeout meals can be high in calories, saturated fat, sugar and sodium. Oftentimes, ordering in also means &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018354/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-while-trying-to-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;distracted eating&lt;/a&gt;—whether you’re watching TV or scrolling on your phone. This type of eating may result in overeating, a risk factor for visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s why swapping your Friday-evening takeout for a healthier, DIY version is the No. 1 habit you should start to help lose visceral fat. Dietitians share all the reasons why making the switch will help you lose visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Takeout Dishes Can Be High in Calories and Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fraga shares, “Many takeout meals are calorie-dense and high in trans and saturated fats, which promote visceral fat accumulation.” In a cross-sectional study, researchers evaluated the connection between specific types of food and visceral fat. They found that people who consumed more saturated fat, total fat and white potatoes had more visceral fat. On the other hand, those who consumed more fiber with higher dietary intake of total vegetables, total fruits (including juice), cereals, whole grains, dietary fiber and calcium had lower amounts of visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Takeout Foods Tend to Be High in Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salt is a food preservative and a mineral that enhances the flavor of foods. It’s also often overused. A review article that included more than 50 studies found a positive association between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894212/ways-to-flush-out-excess-sodium-from-your-body/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the reasons for this is that foods that are high in sodium are often higher in calories and saturated fat. “Takeout is usually loaded with salt, which can increase water retention and raise blood pressure—both of which impact heart and metabolic health,” says Fraga.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Bigger Portions May Lead to Overeating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oversized portions are common for takeout orders or restaurant meals. Your intentions to save some for your next meal are great, but dishes that taste oh-so-good can be hard to resist. Overeating can leave you feeling tired and uncomfortable. Consistently eating more than your body needs can cause weight gain
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cooking at home means you have control over &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8019115/what-are-portion-sizes-do-they-matter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your portions&lt;/a&gt;. If your dish makes multiple servings, portion it out into multiple containers for later. This will give you something to eat tomorrow and help you avoid overeating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating takeout often means eating in front of screens, which increases the risk of overeating,” says Fraga. Distracted eating or mindless eating can cause you to overconsume calories. It can also impact your food choices, taste perception and your ability to recognize when you are full.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making your meal at home takes effort, and to enjoy the fruits of your labor, you might be more likely to sit down and eat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Visceral fat is not something you can see or pinch; rather, it resides deep within your abdominal area. It can be hard to know that you are reducing it without seeing it with your own eyes, but there are many proven lifestyle modifications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Exercising regularly, both cardio and strength training, has been shown to reduce visceral fat,” says Topol. Physical activity guidelines recommend engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Start moving by breaking up your time sitting. Find an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290662/how-to-lose-belly-fat-fast/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;activity you love&lt;/a&gt; and have fun with your movement. Go for walks, swim, play pickleball or hit the gym with a friend. If you enjoy what you are doing, you are more likely to make it a habit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating an abundance of different plants can help you reach your fiber goals. By increasing your intake of plants, you will consume more fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Dietitians put this on top of the list of habits to form if you are looking to lose visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is important for health and longevity. “Not getting enough sleep or poor sleep is linked to higher visceral fat levels,” says Topol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Evaluate your sleep patterns to see where improvements can be made. Can you try to go to bed and wake up around the same time daily? Get support if you need help with formulating a plan. Topol recommends, “Work with a dietitian who takes a holistic approach to get a personalized nutrition plan that also addresses lifestyle factors.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ordering your favorite takeout food once in a while is not going to prevent you from losing visceral fat. It is not about single meals, but rather your overall dietary patterns. Topol says, “It is not just about where you eat, but what you eat and how often. If you are mindful about your food choices and watching portion sizes, eating out does not have to negatively impact health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you are someone who regularly celebrates Fridays with takeout and dines out regularly, making a simple swap to cook your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291719/why-cooking-no-matter-the-recipe-is-better-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Friday night dinner&lt;/a&gt; could save calories, fat and sodium, while also increasing your intake of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to what you eat regularly, how you move your body and your sleep habits can support your overall health and reduce visceral fat. It’s all about stacking on healthy lifestyle habits. Take it one meal or one behavior at a time. You make the most significant impact when you are consistent.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers reviewed and re-analyzed data from dozens of studies to clarify when depression most strongly affects dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest late-life depression may be more than just a risk factor—it could be an early sign of dementia onset. These insights emphasize the urgent need to prioritize mental health care as a long-term strategy to protect brain health and prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifelong Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression in both midlife and later life increases dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; Late-life depression may signal the early stages of dementia development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Strategy Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health care should be central to dementia prevention efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both mid and later life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, which is published in &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine, &lt;/em&gt;was led by Jacob Brain and Maha Alshahrani from the Institute of Mental Health and School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham, University of Adelaide and the Dementia Centre of Excellence at Curtin University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110495"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a face and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brain said: “Our study shows that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both midlife and late life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of recognising and treating depression across the life course, not just for mental health, but also as part of a broader strategy to protect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health efforts need to place greater emphasis on preventative brain health, including scaling up access to effective mental health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects over 57 million people globally. There is currently no cure, so identifying and treating the factors to reduce the risk, such as depression, is an important public health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential links between depression and dementia are complex and may include chronic inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, vascular changes, alterations to neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter imbalances. Shared genetic and behavioural related changes may also increase the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that people with depression are more likely to develop dementia later in life, but there’s been a lot of debate about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; depression matters most, whether it’s depression that starts in midlife – in your 40s or 50s, or depression that appears later in life – in your 60s or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings raise the possibility that depression late in life may not just be a risk factor, but it could also be an early warning sign of dementia beginning to develop. By clarifying this timing, our work helps guide future research, treatment, and prevention strategies,” says Mr Brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out an umbrella review and meta-analysis. They firstly gathered and reviewed all the best available data from systematic reviews with meta-analyses (a statistical method that combines results from multiple studies to provide a more reliable overall estimate), that had already looked at the link between depression and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then went a step further by extracting and re-analysing data from the individual studies within those reviews, plus they added in newer studies that were missed in the earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brain adds: “We specifically focused on the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when depression was measured, whether it was measured in midlife or in later life, and calculated how much it increased the risk of developing dementia. This essentially allowed us to provide a more accurate and up-to-date picture of how depression at different life stages is linked to dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e5d565f4c52514a4a5b10495f52527e50514a4a575059565f53105f5d104b55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Jacob Brain et al. &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for dementia prevention, a global health concern. Depression is considered a risk factor for dementia, but the temporal dynamics across the life course remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess the relationship between the timing of depression assessment and risk of all-cause late-life dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis to assess incident dementia in individuals with non-current history of depression. PubMed and Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched from inception up to February 17, 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between depression and incident late-life dementia were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From eligible reviews, we also extracted data from studies reporting dementia risk as hazard ratios (HRs), analysing the timing of depression measurement using random-effects models for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021249706.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 7763 records identified, nine reviews were eligible for inclusion of the umbrella review. One review was judged to be of moderate quality, while the others were either low (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3) or critically low (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5). For our meta-analyses, 18 studies reporting depression onset in later life (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 901,762 participants, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7595 incident dementia cases) and seven studies on depression assessed during midlife (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 2,501,269 participants, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 276,929 incident dementia cases) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All studies in the meta-analyses were deemed to be of good quality, with no strong evidence of publication bias. Pooled HRs indicated depression present in late-life (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68–2.26; &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 77.5%) and midlife (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12–2.18; &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 97.5%) significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that depression across the life course may increase dementia risk; however, substantial heterogeneity and review quality should be considered when interpreting the strength of this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life course approach to the treatment and prevention of depression may help reduce the burden of dementia, but this will require scaling up access to effective mental health care for vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to clarify if the stronger late-life association reflects depression as an immediate risk factor or an early manifestation of neurodegenerative processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Research, UK Research and Innovation, and Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 13:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9qYmcwcmxSUl9zajQ5cXBTemJEYm9QOVZHM1RCSU9VZ1N1YUVER21lQm5UaEZ1SXd3WllNbVFEb3lSczJHaEE1Y1ozbEZMTWpfTFpicDA4OHA0NHdkV1E1SHlLWWlneWtDeDZBVVIyQjhBZTJySkRZ</guid></item><item><title>医生解释了Ozempic的“百年统治” ，因为模拟显示了该药物的残酷“后果” - LADbible | Doctor explains '100-year-old rule' over Ozempic as simulation shows brutal 'aftermath' of the drug - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPNEdRSi1JT3U5aG5pM0ZzdWJrajBQSzNLQkN1XzNDX2g3Q1c4Z1lqSWwxRFFjaUxOQ3ZXZnZ5T1BwT3h4a3FQLURJYnFwdHZMeG9lRGtVdU53R1Y4Tmd2ZEQ4M1VfNWtRb2VtVTV5SlRCUDMxTld3NmRFano2RHJpbnctbGNsazJEVXZCM3dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A doctor has spoken about a rule she has when it comes to making decisions on her health as she discussed the impacts of Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There are plenty of weight loss drugs on the market which work by telling your brain you're full so you won't eat as much, with the idea that it'll significantly lower your calorific intake and cause you to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, it's not as simple as jabbing yourself thinner, as there are plenty of other health impacts of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some people taking the likes of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, Wegovy, Mounjaro and others &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-aftermath-side-effects-warning-doctors-fasting-uk-123012-20250525"&gt;have noticed side effects&lt;/a&gt;, especially on their digestive systems, and the simulations aren't particularly pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking about the impact of drugs like Ozempic, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/good-night-sleep-stop-eating-eight-hours-080320-20241207"&gt;Dr Mindy Pelz&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the &lt;em&gt;Diary of a CEO&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjIXLQ_OdA"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; to say how the drug had some 'amazing upsides' and warned not to 'totally villainise it', but that with every &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health decision&lt;/a&gt; she wanted to keep her '100-year-old' rule in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doctor said it could be a 'lifeline' for people going through a 'massive metabolic crisis', but hammered home the point that there was no easy ticket to a healthy life and the real key was your lifestyle itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"In the end you are going to have to make health your responsibility, and you're going to have to work for it, especially as you age," Dr Pelz pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"One of my guiding principles that I always think about is my 100-year-old self.

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-05-30T10:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Friday, May 30, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Scientists identify diagnostic aid to determine risk of diabetic foot ulcer recurrence&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH-funded project shows that trans-epidermal water loss could indicate if wounds are fully healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified a diagnostic aid that has the potential to accurately predict the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers that appear to be fully healed. By measuring the skin’s barrier function through a process known as trans-epidermal water loss, or TEWL, scientists were able to determine which wounds were more likely to reopen. TEWL measurements are a major factor in burn care, where deep layers of the skin are often damaged. The findings suggest that full restoration of skin barrier function should be incorporated into existing wound treatment standards to ensure complete wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This study is an important initial step to give clinicians treating diabetic foot ulcers a reliable diagnostic aid for the first time to assess an individual’s risk of ulcer recurrence,” said Teresa Jones, M.D. program director for the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, &amp;amp; Metabolic Diseases at NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). “Foot ulcers are such a confounding issue with diabetes and being able to determine which wounds are at highest risk for recurrence could save many lives and limbs.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists, working together through the NIDDK Diabetic Foot Consortium, evaluated over 400 study participants who had a diabetic foot ulcer that visually appeared to be closed or healed. They measured TEWL at the site of the foot ulcer and found that 35% of participants with high TEWL (more water loss) reported a wound recurrence by 16 weeks, compared to just 17% for those with low TEWL (less water loss). Participants with higher TEWL were 2.7 times more likely to experience a wound recurrence than participants with low TEWL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication of diabetes where a break in the skin of the foot is often unnoticed by a patient due to nerve damage, known as neuropathy. They are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations, and untreated or unhealed ulcers significantly increase the risk of death. Wounds that appear to be healed on the surface may not be fully closed below the superficial surface of the skin, hampering the effectiveness of the skin’s barrier function to keep in water and keep out pathogens, such as bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study results will publish in &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;, a journal of the American Diabetes Association. The study was funded by NIH/NIDDK grants (U01DK119099, U24DK122927, U01DK119100, U01DK119083, U01DK119094, U01DK119085 and U01DK119102) and carried out by members of NIH’s &lt;a href="https://diabeticfootconsortium.org/"&gt;Diabetic Foot Consortium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about a shitty situation. Christine Connell recently took to TikTok to recount how she developed a seven-year-long sinus infection after her boyfriend’s gross behavior.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the video, which has since been made private, Connell explained how doctors were baffled by her persistent sinus infection, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/health/ive-had-a-7-year-infection-since-my-ex-farted-in-my-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Eventually, doctors decided to take culture samples from her nose. It was then that they learned E. coli was to blame for her prolonged illness.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“E. coli is from poop,” she said in the clip. ““How does that get in your sinuses unless you have a boyfriend who farts disgustingly and you are forced to inhale it because you are immobile after ankle surgery?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a second video, which the outlet additionally reported on, Connell gave more background on the situation. She stated that she and her ex where in a hotel room that had two beds. At one point, her then-boyfriend stood naked between the beds, with his butt facing her.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“That is when the fart happened,” Connell said. “I’ve never, ever, ever smelled anything that compares to that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Connell noted that her ex didn’t intentionally fart in her face. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“He was just getting into bed and my face happened to be in the path of the fart that was released,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-woman-says-she-had-a-7-year-infection-after-her-ex-farted-in-her-face"&gt;Woman Says She Had a 7-Year Infection After Her Ex Farted in Her Face&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16638-e-coli-infection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, E. coli spreads through fecal-oral transmission. It causes illness when bacteria from poop that’s too small to see make its way into a person’s mouth and digestive tract. Typically, E. coli causes symptoms such as diarrhea and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it is common. It can happen. It has happened before, but it’s definitely rare,” Connell said of her illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She went on to explain why she thinks the bacteria affected her so seriously.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“I had just had ankle surgery that I was recovering from. I imagine that my immune system was focused on healing that,” she said. “… Maybe in another circumstance, like if I had been healthy, it wouldn’t have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a third video, which was also reported by the outlet, Connell revealed that her prescribed antibiotics weren’t healing her sinus infection. Now she must undergo surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re going to use general anesthesia to go up there and physically scrape off where the bacteria has been and really wash it and get all of the infected tissue out of there,” she said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
