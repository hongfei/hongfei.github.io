Using an advanced imaging technique called NODDI, scientists mapped the organization of neural pathways that govern emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that specific brain tracts were linked to increases in either positive or negative emotionality by nine months. Infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle displayed more positive emotions and better self-soothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Emotional Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; White matter structure at 3 months predicts emotional patterns by 9 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Forceps minor linked to negative emotionality; cingulum bundle linked to positive growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Imaging Standard:&lt;/strong&gt; NODDI imaging provides detailed insight into infant brain development previously unseen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a comprehensive Genomic Press research article, scientists have uncovered remarkable insights into how the earliest brain connections shape infant emotional development, potentially offering new ways to identify children at risk for future behavioral and emotional challenges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, led by Dr. Yicheng Zhang and Dr. Mary L. Phillips at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, examined 95 infant-caregiver pairs using advanced brain imaging techniques. Researchers discovered that the microstructure of white matter tracts – the brain’s information highways – at just 3 months of age could predict how infants’ emotions and self-soothing abilities would evolve over the following six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110629"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoding the Infant Brain’s Emotional Blueprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team employed sophisticated Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), a cutting-edge MRI technique that provides unprecedented detail about brain tissue organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology allowed scientists to peer into the developing brain’s architecture with remarkable precision, revealing how the arrangement of neural fibers influences emotional trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing is that the brain’s structural organization in early infancy sets the stage for emotional development,” explains the research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on critical white matter pathways connecting regions responsible for self-awareness, attention to important stimuli, and cognitive control – networks that form the foundation of emotional processing throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Discoveries Shape Understanding of Emotional Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed distinct patterns linking brain structure to emotional outcomes. Infants with higher neurite dispersion in the forceps minor – a bundle of fibers connecting the brain’s hemispheres – showed greater increases in negative emotionality between 3 and 9 months. This suggests that certain patterns of brain connectivity might predispose infants to heightened emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in executive control, demonstrated larger increases in positive emotions and improved self-soothing abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries raise intriguing questions about whether early interventions could potentially influence these neural pathways to promote healthier emotional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Early Detection and Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify infants at risk for emotional difficulties before behavioral symptoms emerge represents a significant advance in developmental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has established that high negative emotionality in infancy correlates with increased risk for future anxiety and behavioral disorders, while low positive emotionality links to later depression and social difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Phillips notes the potential impact: “Understanding these early neural markers could transform how we approach infant mental health, allowing for targeted interventions during critical developmental windows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team validated their findings in an independent sample of 44 infants, strengthening confidence in these brain-behavior relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Imaging Reveals Hidden Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s use of NODDI technology marks a significant methodological advance in infant brain research. Traditional imaging methods often struggle to capture the nuanced organization of developing brain tissue. NODDI’s ability to separate different tissue components provides researchers with a clearer picture of how neural pathways mature and organize during this crucial period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research examined three major white matter tracts: the forceps minor, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus. Each plays a vital role in connecting brain regions essential for emotional processing and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might variations in other brain connections influence infant development? What role do environmental factors play in shaping these neural pathways?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridging Neuroscience and Clinical Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have immediate relevance for pediatric care and early childhood development. By identifying objective neural markers of emotional development, clinicians could potentially screen for risk factors before behavioral problems emerge. This proactive approach could lead to earlier, more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team accounted for multiple factors that might influence brain development, including caregiver mental health, socioeconomic status, and infant characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive approach strengthens the study’s conclusions and suggests that brain microstructure represents a fundamental contributor to emotional development independent of environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Directions and Unanswered Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings represent a significant advance, they also open new avenues for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How stable are these early neural patterns throughout childhood? Can targeted interventions modify white matter development to promote emotional resilience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s ongoing work aims to address these questions through longitudinal studies following infants into later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. During this time, rapid changes in white matter organization lay the foundation for lifelong emotional and behavioral patterns. Understanding these processes at a neural level could inform everything from parenting practices to public health policies supporting infant development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Era in Developmental Neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research exemplifies the power of advanced neuroimaging to reveal previously hidden aspects of brain development. As technology continues to evolve, scientists gain increasingly sophisticated tools to understand how the brain’s earliest organization shapes human behavior and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Pittsburgh team’s findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that many aspects of emotional and behavioral development have roots in the brain’s earliest structural patterns. By identifying these patterns, researchers move closer to developing targeted interventions that could prevent or mitigate future mental health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications extend beyond individual children to broader questions about human development. How do genetic and environmental factors interact to shape these early brain patterns? What evolutionary advantages might different patterns of emotional development confer? These fundamental questions drive continued research in this rapidly advancing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates that even in the earliest months of life, the brain’s structural organization profoundly influences emotional development. This knowledge opens new possibilities for supporting healthy development from the very beginning of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this emotion and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b4b8b5b0f7aeb6b7be99bebcb7b6b4b0baa9abbcaaaaf7bab6b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/gp025a.0026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early infant white matter tract microstructure predictors of subsequent change in emotionality and emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;” by Yicheng Zhang et al. &lt;em&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early infant white matter tract microstructure predictors of subsequent change in emotionality and emotional regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are rapid changes in negative and positive emotionality (NE, PE) and emotional regulation (e.g., soothability) during the first year of life. Understanding the neural basis of these changes during maturation can enhance the understanding of the etiology of early psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to determine how measures of white matter (WM) microstructure in tracts connecting key emotion-related neural networks, including the forceps minor (FM), cingulum bundle (CB), and uncinate fasciculus interconnecting the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), can predict developmental change in infant emotionality and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) measures together with conventional diffusion tensor metrics to examine WM tract microstructure and fiber collinearity in the primary sample (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 95), and modeled each WM feature with caregiver-reported infant NE, PE, and soothability, with infant and caregiver sociodemographic factors as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 3-month infants, higher neurite dispersion and lower longitudinal fiber alignment in the FM were associated with a larger increase in NE from 3 to 9 months of age, suggesting that greater integration of the DMN, SN, and CEN leads to a larger subsequent increase in NE; while higher neurite density and dispersion as well as lower WM longitudinal alignment in the left CB were associated with a larger increase in PE, suggesting that greater integration within the CEN leads to increasing PE over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, higher neurite dispersion and lower WM longitudinal alignment in the left CB were associated with a larger increase in soothability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations among diffusion tensor measures and changes in infant emotionality and emotional regulation measures were replicated in an independent test sample (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that early infant WM microstructural features support infant emotionality and emotional regulation development and could represent early biomarkers of future emotional and behavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 20:23:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE00czRQRHVHbF9uQk0xM0hhNjhIV0xFODFXUXAwQzZTUVhEU1hkQUFvRE9jUWt6N3dDdUYxRkpxUkxmeDVfX1JkYUtCd1JlMjc0SUduLXFFTHZkNlUtTU5XSE9NRk1JcjltcnpPaw</guid></item><item><title>大麻化合物可以保护我们免受致命的真菌疾病- ScienceAlert | Cannabis Compound Could Protect Us From Deadly Fungal Disease - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNb2REN0VRcjlVSklONzlSX21ERmNvRjlSU01sZ296bi1fRlgzQnFqWnMxcGJIOXFVMWU3bk1SZVVqTjZmWTFWMUl3STh6Z0dkOHVyeDN4NzBGOXNEZ2IwdWJiRVFGTnNUdGlndmxoem5PZnZUOEM3TUR4WWxrRHdyN0FuQVVYejZURWVQRzlNbXRJY0VP?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A dangerous fungal pathogen has proven no match for what may be one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1200269"&gt;most useful plants in nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying the chemical properties of cannabis have found it kills one of the most dangerous fungal pathogens in the world – in a laboratory setting, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a species of fungus behind &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptococcosis/about/index.html"&gt;cryptococcosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/infectious-diseases/cryptococcosis"&gt;cryptococcal meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be vulnerable to topical treatment with cannabidiol and cannabidivarin, compounds found in the plant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; gets to your central nervous system, it causes life-threatening meningitis," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabidiol-shows-promise-as-treatment-for-fungal-infections"&gt;explains biologist Hue Dinh&lt;/a&gt; of Macquarie University in Australia. "The mortality rate is very high, and it's really hard to treat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ygtX2nyexo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungal pathogens pose a pretty significant threat to human health, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.120"&gt;around 300 species&lt;/a&gt; known to cause diseases in humans, with varying levels of severity. Because pathogens such as fungi and bacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2018.04.059"&gt;continually develop resistances to drugs&lt;/a&gt;, new treatment options are continually needed to keep them at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy is to look at medications that have already been approved for human use for other ailments. Dinh and her colleagues turned their research to cannabis, isolating five compounds to test on &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; and a range of other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They isolated the fungal species in a lab, and applied the compounds. Cannabidiol (CBD), which is non-psychoactive, and cannabidivarin (CBDV), which is psychoactive, both killed &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; adroitly, acting even faster than current antifungal treatments. They were also effective at eradicating the fungal pathogens responsible for such conditions as jock itch and athlete's foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Proteomics analysis revealed that the antifungal activity of CBD and CBDV was linked to destabilization of the membrane, alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis, disruption of metabolic pathways, as well as selective involvement of mitochondrial-associated proteins," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0013081"&gt;the researchers wrote in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one thing to kill a fungus in a petri dish, but quite another to observe the treatment working in a living system. To test their findings further, the researchers turned to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_mellonella"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greater wax moth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-dxMTDzMLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2015.1135289"&gt;larvae of this moth&lt;/a&gt; possess an innate immune response that is similar to that of mammals. They are also inexpensive to obtain, have short lifespans, and require no special equipment to keep, making them an excellent model for large-scale studies of infectious pathogens and the treatments thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moth larvae were given small burn wounds, and then divided into groups. One group was left alone with just the burn wounds as a control; the remainder were infected with &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, and treated with different medicaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was treated with CBD dissolved in dimethyl sulfide. Another group was treated with dimethyl sulfide without the CBD. Finally, the last group was treated using Amphotericin B, a medication used to treat serious fungal infections in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. The survival rate of the larvae treated with CBD was significantly higher than the survival rate of the larvae treated with the dimethyl sulfide alone, and also higher than the survival rate of the Amphotericin B group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163523" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-163523" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn-600x198.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163523" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The survival rate of larvae infected with &lt;em&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/em&gt; and given various treatments. (Dinh et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was nearly as high as the survival rate of the control group – the larvae that had not been infected with the fungus at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the treatment of infections that reach the lungs and brain is a bit more complicated, the result suggests that, at the very least, the topical application of cannabidiol might be effective at treating a range of fungal skin infections.&lt;/p&gt;

She then realized that the blood came from her anus and thought it was a hemorrhoid. When she went in for a doctor to address it, she learned some worrisome news — she had Stage 3 anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The surgeon, she said, ‘It’s cancer and we found out it was not just one but two tumors,” DeVillers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e9cff2" class="body-heading"&gt;Fatigue and bleeding &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In March 2022, DeVillers noticed she was bleeding a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was bleeding when I was going to the bathroom. At first, honestly, I thought perimenopause,” she explains. “I didn’t know the bleeding was coming from my tush. I thought I was getting my period again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She also felt exhausted, but thought it was to due being busy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had started feeling more fatigued, but I was also traveling for work, so I chalked it up to that,” she says. “I was both fatigued and scared about why I was bleeding.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When DeVillers noticed the blood was coming from her anus, she reached out to her doctor, who consulted with a gastrointestinal doctor. They suspected DeVillers had a hemorrhoid and recommended Devillers try hemorrhoid cream. If her symptoms did not improve in three months, she should visit the GI doctor. Yet the intensity of the bleeding worried her and she wanted a solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t non-stop. All of a sudden, I would have a gush of blood,” she says. “I really begged them to put me on a waiting list.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The office was able to schedule DeVillers for surgery to have the hemorrhoid removed in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When I came out of it, I was really groggy from the anesthesia, but I remember my husband was holding one hand and my doctor was holding the other hand,” DeVillers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s when the doctor broke the news that DeVillers had cancer. After determining that she had Stage 3 anal cancer because it had spread to her lymph nodes, doctors came up with a treatment plan that included IV chemotherapy “every couple of weeks,” plus radiation and oral chemotherapy for five days a week for six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really intensive,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-f695a4"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;While in the intensive care unit, Julia DeVillers didn't remember much of her stay. However, she kept taking selfies of her experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While treatment was supposed to last for six weeks, during week three following her second IV chemotherapy infusion, DeVillers “seemed to crash and burn.” Prior to week three, DeVillers had been working, visiting friends and family and walking into a doctor’s office without assistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My colon got twisted and I was in excruciating pain,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Then her symptoms intensified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I started vomiting neon green,” she says. “I went to the ER, and I collapsed and then next thing I knew I was checked into the ICU ... My whole system collapsed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;DeVillers spent the next five weeks in the intensive care unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I remember about two of them and the first week I think went fairly well. I was lucid. I was talking,” she says. “They were figuring out what’s going on, pumping me with fluids.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By the second week, doctors noticed her blood cell counts had plummeted and called her children because they were unsure how much time DeVillers had left. They also enlisted hospice care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That was horrible for my family,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She felt her “body shutting down.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I saw this dark tunnel and it had two pricks of white light,” she says. This lasted “a day or two and I felt darkness. I was very depressed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She received a blood transfusion. Soon, DeVillers began feeling better, and “the tunnel got lighter and lighter.” While she was in the ICU, she did not continue with chemotherapy. She lost about 30 pounds while there and was “really weak, very frail.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Even as sick as I was, they wheeled me into radiation,” she says. “My radiologist, I’ll forever be grateful for him. He said, ‘If we stop now, it could come back. But if we keep going to radiation … that’s what’s going to get rid of the tumor.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Three months after she finished treatment in August 2022, doctors told her they had “cautious good news” that there were no signs of cancer remaining, but they still worried about a lymph node that caused a visible bump on her abdomen. Six months after treatment, she was cancer-free. It took all that time for her to rebuild her strength from being in the ICU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had in-home health care for months because I was hooked up to a food IV bag and I was still not allowed to eat,” she says. “I stayed in bed a lot but I could get up and walk. So that was wonderful.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bf8430" class="body-heading"&gt;Anal cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anal cancer differs from colorectal cancer even though they share some symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Colorectal cancer comes from the cells that line the inside of your GI tract, while anal cancer comes from the skin cells that are the same as the skin that is covering the rest of your body,” Dr. Emily Huang, a colon and rectal surgeon, and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, where DeVillers received treatment, tells TODAY.com. “The vast majority of anal cancers are associated with HPV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-3bd01b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Julia DeVillers experienced complications from treatment. Even when she was in the ICU and weak, she kept going to radiation, which helped eliminate her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;HPV, otherwise known as the human papillomavirus, is a common virus often spread through skin-to-skin contact. It can cause six types of cancer including anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and throat cancer, according to past &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393?search=HPV" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY.com reporting&lt;/a&gt;. But these cancers can be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We do a lot to prevent HPV-associated cancers through things like vaccination,” Huang says. “We do screening for HPV-related cancers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The HPV vaccine is 97% effective at preventing cancers associated with the virus because it protects people from developing six high-risk strains of HPV likely to cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the things that (we) can do is actually get someone who’s not already vaccinated, vaccinate,” Huang says. “It gets the immune system revved up to help fight the infection that is the root cause for the cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of anal cancer are similar to colorectal cancer signs. Anal cancer symptoms include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump or mass on the anus &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatment for anal cancer includes radiation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news about anal cancer is that it is actually very, very effectively treated by radiation therapy, specifically chemo radiation,” Huang says. “Those types of skin cells are highly responsive to radiation and so the majority of people who are diagnosed with anal cancer and undergo chemoradiation actually have a complete cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anal cancer “is pretty uncommon, though we don’t know with the rise of HPV-related cancer, in general, whether that’s going to change.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With the increase in colorectal cancer, Huang says patients are more comfortable talking about bleeding or bowel changes. Still, there’s a stigma associated with anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I frequently get patients who come into clinic saying, ‘I was embarrassed to even talk about this,’” she says. “These bothersome and slightly embarrassing symptoms might be easy to chalk up to something much simpler (like hemorrhoids).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7254a0" class="body-heading"&gt;Overcoming the stigma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As a writer, DeVillers shied away from bawdy humor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m a children’s book author, and people would say, ‘Oh add a fart to the book.’ I’m like ‘Oh I’m squeamish. I don’t want to talk about farts and butt jokes,’” she says. “I’ve changed obviously my whole attitude for both awareness and dark humor of the situation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At first, she “felt really embarrassed,” when she was diagnosed with anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-ca3fe5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;At first, Julie DeVillers felt ashamed of having anal cancer and called it 'tush cancer' or anything that sounded less embarrassing.

Men get it,” she says. “It’s all directly related to getting HPV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She recently published her first book since her diagnosis, “Meet Me at Wonderland,” which has themes that came from her ICU stay. Doctors would ask her questions, such as, ‘What do you do for work,’ to test her lucidity. She answered she worked at Chuck E. Cheese, a job she held in high school when she often wore the rat costume. While telling her agent this story, she recalled an embarrassing anecdote that became the foundation for the meet cute at the beginning of her latest novel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I went into the break room, and I took off my rat head and there was a very cute boy sitting in front of me filling out his job application.

seeds such as pumpkin, sunflower and watermelon; whole grains such as oats and barley as well as legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and soybeans are also good dietary sources of phytosterols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound is also found in vegetables such as artichokes, broccoli, green beans, sweet potatoes and cauliflower as well as fruits such as pineapples, oranges, berries and bananas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers followed over 200,000 American adults for 36 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to periodically answer questionnaires on dietary intake to measure how much phytosterol-rich food they were consuming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their answers were then evaluated using a variety of statistical models to discover their likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the follow-up period, the researchers noted over 20,000 study participants developed Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d7287a20-4079-11f0-84c9-e91538c4e9b7"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and nearly 16,000 developed heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers suggest that eating a healthy diet rich in plant-based foods can help to prevent or delay heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed those who consumed about five servings of vegetables, three servings of fruit, two servings of whole grains and half a serving of nuts - all of which are high in phytosterols - per day were about 10 percent less likely to develop either conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But nearly no American reaches these benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also analyzed metabolites - products of metabolism - and other metabolic biomarkers present in blood samples from about 40,000 people to understand the effect of phytosterols on the calorie-burning process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California, San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She had problems falling asleep, and she’d wake up in the middle of the night,” he said. “So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies” — edible cannabis candies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then another — a total of four over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to “start low; go slow,” beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman started feeling intense anxiety and experiencing heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had hypertension and the heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Frightened, she went to an emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac workup determined that the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states and Washington, D.C., now allow cannabis use for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as Washington, D.C., recreational use is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related ER visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons — to relieve chronic pain, insomnia or mental health issues. But evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of national survey data &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834781?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;published Monday in the medical journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous 30 days) had jumped among adults 65 and older to 7% of respondents in 2023 from 4.8% in 2021. Back in 2005, he pointed out, less than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;perceived risk of cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; has declined. One national survey found that a growing proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;erroneously thought it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to “wisdom customers” 55 and older. RISE Dispensaries ran a yearlong “cannabis education and empowerment” program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;which legalized nonmedical cannabis nationally in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, show climbing rates of older people seeking medical treatment for cannabis-related issues, both &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;in outpatient settings and in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cannabis-related ER visits by those 65 and older rose&lt;/a&gt; to about 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019, from 21 in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults between 2008 and 2021, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;more than 26-fold among those 65 and older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Dr. Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;increased cardiac risk &lt;/a&gt;among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a significant proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis screen positive for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other substance-abuse disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (average age: 73) seeking care at Veterans Affairs health facilities, researchers found that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the past 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mild, moderate or severe cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance abuse and have “higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD” that could lead to self-medication, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current VA policies don’t require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “there’s increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,” said Myran, citing his team’s study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It showed that compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a 23% higher dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn’t specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption and on amounts of use that seem lower risk,” Myran said. “It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15"&gt;&lt;p class="pull-quote-content"&gt;It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption and on amounts of use that seem lower risk. It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Dr. Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products than the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn’t use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,” he said. “Because that is true of all medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Old Age is produced through a partnership with KFF Health News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A woman’s practice of nasal irrigation led to her death via brain-eating amoeba. In a recent case report, health officials described how she contracted a fatal infection of &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; through tainted tap water sourced from a recreational vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Federal and local health officials in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the unusual death last week in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The 71-year-old woman developed neurological symptoms days after using a nasal irrigation device and died only a week later. These infections, while rare, can be prevented through practical safety measures, such as only using sterilized water for nasal irrigation, officials say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shapeshifting amoeba&lt;/a&gt; that lives in soil and warm freshwater. It typically feeds on bacteria and isn’t dangerous to humans when it’s simply ingested. But when the amoeba enters our body through the nose, it can end up in the brain. Once there, the amoeba will literally feast on brain cells and trigger massive inflammation, causing a severe brain infection known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;primary amebic meningoencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, or PAM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the MMWR report, the previously healthy woman sought medical care with fever, headache, and altered mental status. Four days earlier, she had irrigated her nose with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Doctors quickly suspected PAM, but even with treatment, she developed seizures and died eight days after her symptoms began. The bizarre nature of her death then prompted an investigation by the Texas Department of State Health Services and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials tested both the water from the RV’s portable water tank and the nearby municipal water system the RV may have been connected to during the trip. Neither source tested positive for the amoeba, and officials were only able to sample the water 23 days after the woman’s exposure, so the environmental conditions may have simply changed by then. But they did find evidence that the RV’s water system wasn’t properly disinfected to prevent contamination, likely explaining how the amoeba found its way into the woman’s tap water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This case reinforces the potential for serious health risks associated with improper use of nasal irrigation devices, as well as the importance of maintaining RV water quality and ensuring that municipal water systems adhere to regulatory standards,” the officials wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;PAM is very rare, with only around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/graphs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;150 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported since the amoeba was discovered in the 1960s, but it’s nearly always fatal once symptoms start. Most infections are typically caught when people get water up their nose while swimming in warm lakes. But the amoeba can also survive in drinking or recreational water systems, especially if they’re not properly sterilized. And there have been several cases of people getting infected through using contaminated tap water for nasal irrigation (irrigation is usually performed to clear the sinuses in people with allergies or respiratory infections).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say that PAM can be easily prevented through recommended nasal irrigation practices, which include only relying on distilled, sterilized, or boiled and cooled tap water for irrigation. This latest case also highlights the unique danger posed by improperly cleaned RV water systems.

Instead of looking at gene expression broadly, they zoomed in on the exon level—the building blocks that influence how proteins are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that gene activity differences were only apparent at this finer scale, not at the whole-gene level. The study revealed that disruptions in stress hormone regulation, dopamine signaling, and circadian rhythms are common to multiple disorders, including schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exon-Level Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychiatric patients showed differences from healthy individuals only at the exon level, not the whole-gene level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in circadian rhythm, cortisol release, and dopamine pathways were common across disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Precision Psychiatry:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support classifying psychiatric disorders by biological mechanisms, not just symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Helmholtz Munich and the University of Sydney identified biological mechanisms that are shared across psychiatric disorders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the team analyzed postmortem brain tissue samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area of the brain is the center for reasoning and emotions in the brain, and is often implicated in psychiatric disorders. Samples from affected individuals, most of whom were schizophrenia patients, and healthy controls were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this study special: The research team combined several different layers of genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast to studies that look at gene expression as a whole, we analyzed the exon level to better understand the structure of the genes. This detailed approach gave us a better understanding of how genetic variation influences disease risk”, first author Karolina Worf explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exons are the essential, information-containing segments of a gene. In addition to providing the blueprint for building proteins, they also determine which versions of a protein ultimately arise from a gene. This happens through alternative splicing, a process that occurs in over 95 percent of human genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Differences at the exon level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the exon level in the analysis was an important step: While samples from psychiatric patients and healthy controls were not significantly different at the gene level, they were significantly different at the exon level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk of developing a psychiatric disorder seems to therefore not just depend on what genes you have, but how your genes are expressed”, Janine Knauer-Arloth, leader of the Project Group Medical Genomics at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team integrated different genetic data, including variations in individual base pairs of DNA (single nucleotide polymorphisms), rare genetic variants and polygenic risk scores, which summarize a person’s disease risk by aggregating all relevant genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, the researchers discovered disruptions in pathways related to the circadian rhythm, the release of the stress hormone cortisol, and the neurotransmitter dopamine — across all three included disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show that psychiatric disorders share a common biological basis. In the long-term, this knowledge can help researchers to classify psychiatric disorders not only based on symptoms, but also based on biological mechanisms. This paradigm shift is significant a step towards more precise diagnoses and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anke Schlee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Anke Schlee – Max Planck Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03366-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exon-variant interplay and multi-modal evidence identify endocrine dysregulation in severe psychiatric disorders impacting excitatory neurons&lt;/a&gt;” by Janine Knauer-Arloth et al. &lt;em&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exon-variant interplay and multi-modal evidence identify endocrine dysregulation in severe psychiatric disorders impacting excitatory neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia share genetic architecture, yet their molecular mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both common and rare genetic variants contribute to neural dysfunction, impacting cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the molecular effects of genetic variants on human cortical single-cell types using a single-exon analysis approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating exon-level eQTLs (common variants influencing exon expression) and joint exon eQT-Scores (combining polygenic risk scores with exon-level gene expression) from a postmortem psychiatric cohort (BD = 15, MDD = 24, schizophrenia = 68, controls = 62) with schizophrenia-focused rare variant data from the SCHEMA consortium, we identified 110 core genes enriched in pathways including circadian entrainment (FDR = 0.02), cortisol synthesis and secretion (FDR = 0.026), and dopaminergic synapse (FDR = 0.038).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional enriched pathways included hormone signaling (FDRs &amp;lt; 0.0298, including insulin, GnRH, aldosterone, and growth hormone pathways) and, notably, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes (FDR = 0.0028). These pathways highlight shared molecular mechanisms in the three disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-nuclei RNA sequencing data from three cortical regions revealed that these core set genes are predominantly expressed in excitatory neuron layers 2–6 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, linking molecular changes to cell types involved in cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate the power of integrating multimodal genetic and transcriptomic data at the exon level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach moves beyond symptom-based diagnoses toward molecular classifications, identifying potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBTYkNLTUJVWFdaT3k2cmliUzY3SThoUVFmUTNzLVFLQXpnb0lEUVBTanFFUzctUFl0cWUzRTd2S2ZYSkZLbFhEQjk4V3JLUF9fczFlUk1OdkhzQ3ZwV1N0UHRvNWVfMDBnSEtPcXBjOERvNkpU</guid></item><item><title>我鼓励我的丈夫在床上看到一个“支持小组”来解决他的问题。他们毒害了他的思想。- Slate Magazine | I Encouraged My Husband to See a “Support Group” for His Issue in Bed.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdy6g001j3b77mpms812n@published"&gt;My husband and I are both 67 and have been married/monogamous for 15 years. We are in reasonably good health, but for the last year, he has been struggling with erectile dysfunction, which we know is not uncommon at our age. He’s very reluctant to speak to our primary care physician about the problem, and I understand that it could feel awkward. I’ve suggested that he try having a telehealth meeting with a urologist, but I have yet to convince him. He has mild hypertension, so any medicinal options would need a doctor’s supervision. I encouraged him to seek an online support group, which he has done, but I am less than thrilled with the direction that support has taken.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdy8d001k3b77ogfq012t@published"&gt;He’s become convinced that he can overcome the ED without medical intervention if I help. Apparently that “help” involves porn star levels of endurance and aerobics. I’m open to almost anything—role playing, costumes, toys, etc. But I have asthma and arthritis, so a marathon session is not doable for me, and there are a couple of positions I can’t accommodate or maintain. Also, none of the techniques or positions he thinks might be beneficial are going to work if he can’t get an erection. We had a very satisfying sex life, even with my minor limitations, which have existed throughout our relationship, so I don’t believe my challenges are part of the problem. I think he’s looking for any and every solution that doesn’t require talking to a physician. I want to help, and I can see how much our lack of intimacy is bothering him (and me, too!), but I think he’s on the wrong track. I still believe he needs a doctor’s guidance, not a partner with adult film star abilities. If you agree, how do I convince him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyeo001n3b774pc0cuio@published"&gt;I’m so confused. As you point out, if the solution for your husband’s erectile difficulties requires acrobatic sex, how is he going to get hard enough to engage in that sex? I wish I knew what the support group members were telling him, so I’d have a better chance of understanding where this idea is coming from. That might be a good place to start, though. Is he willing to share some exact quotes or any web resources that group members are directing him to? Maybe there’s a communication error happening somewhere along the way, even between him and you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdygi001o3b77x9e0ezc0@published"&gt;Ideally, the two of you could take the pressure off of his penis (and your joints) and reconsider what sexual intimacy can look like. In the event that his ED is mental, in which case, medication is unlikely to change things, this shifting of focus can actually help erections occur. (I often recommend “pleasure mapping” as a way to start—&lt;a href="https://youtime.com/think/pleasure-mapping-a-guide-to-learning-what-you-like"&gt;you can get a quick overview on it here&lt;/a&gt;.) Regardless, the two of you would still be connecting physically. You can think of this as another instance of adapting to changing bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyij001p3b77fu3d70vq@published"&gt;That said, given his age and the fact of hypertension, medical intervention may actually be what’s required here. I’m somewhat surprised, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3357516/"&gt;given longstanding links between the two&lt;/a&gt;, that the doctors treating his hypertension haven’t directly asked about the state of his sexual health. So you might gently present him with some information about how often the two issues co-occur and underline the fact that this means his doctors have probably fielded similar inquiries in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyke001q3b77oya2dx1m@published"&gt;I’m curious, because of your speculation around awkwardness being a barrier to asking for help, whether you’ve listened to how your husband is feeling or what his reasoning is. Assumptions can make providing support much more difficult than it needs to be. Giving your husband the space to open up and share is your best chance of finding your way back to physical intimacy—whether that’s through helping him feel comfortable talking to his doctor or redefining the ways you engage in erotic contact.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyof001s3b77q6mj7tns@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for nearly 20 years. I have never cheated on her, and we do not have an open marriage. Lately, however, I have had recurring fantasies about being seduced by and having sex with another woman. I haven’t said anything about this to my wife because I don’t want to upset her. The fantasies are becoming more pervasive, particularly when my wife and I make love. Is something wrong with me or my marriage?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyur001v3b778crlyb3p@published"&gt;I don’t know. People having fantasies, even about people other than their partners, isn’t wrong. According to research, such as the massive study Justin Lehmiller based his book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Me-What-You-Want-ebook/dp/B0776PYDNM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell Me What You Want&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on, these fantasies are pretty common. This in no way guarantees that there’s nothing wrong with you, or with your marriage, though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbfmdyxt001w3b77d7jdhewn@published"&gt;So, think through it. Has there been anything else about your mind, or anything about your marriage, that’s been bothering you? If so, go ahead and address that for the pure purpose of taking action when you see an issue. If not, I wouldn’t worry about the state of either.&lt;/p&gt;

If that’s the case, it’s worth asking your wife whether she’s comfortable taking the lead sometimes. You can frame this as a simple desire and leave the fantasies about other women out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s hinted that he’d like to be more than friends. I don’t want to create awkwardness by asking him, and I hate myself for considering this, but in terms of sex, would our options be restricted to just hand and mouth stuff and using toys?&lt;/p&gt;

He may get hard in response to appropriate stimuli, which, just like men who aren’t paralyzed, will vary depending on the individual. It’s also possible that he doesn’t respond to stimulation but uses erectile support medication such as pills or injections. Or it may be the case that erections aren’t an option for him, and you’d be, as you put it, “restricted to just hand and mouth stuff” and toys.&lt;/p&gt;

While “being more than friends” might mean simply adding sex to your relationship, you’ll also want to consider whether dating is part of the desired package for both of you. If dating is on the table, there will probably be other discussions you two will need to have as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

And why do you hate yourself for questioning whether the sex your friend can engage in will be enough for you? Really think through these emotions. If you do decide to move forward, keep in mind that this first conversation—about whether penile penetration is possible—is only the start.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers used AI to analyze data from nearly 6,000 UK children, uncovering gender-specific vulnerabilities—boys were more impacted by smoking during pregnancy, while girls were more affected by early fussiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support the need for gender-responsive early screening tools and preventive care policies. Experts emphasize the value of acting early, even before symptoms emerge, to protect children’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive AI:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning revealed 14 early-life risk factors that predict mental health challenges by age five.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys were more sensitive to maternal smoking, while girls were more affected by infant fussiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Action:&lt;/strong&gt; The study supports preventive care investments during pregnancy to improve children’s mental well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers identified strong and often overlooked emotional and behavioural risk factors that can be predicted to be present in five-year-old children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of breastfeeding, low birth weight and maternal smoking during pregnancy are factors that can be used to react very early, even before the child shows symptoms,” says the study’s lead author, doctoral researcher Xu Zong from the University of Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders,&lt;/em&gt; used artificial intelligence to analyse data from nearly 6,000 children in a longitudinal study of UK households. The aim was to use pregnancy and newborn risk factors to predict emotional and behavioural difficulties in children at the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found differences between the sexes: boys were more affected by maternal smoking, while girls were more vulnerable to fussiness in infancy. According to the researcher, these findings highlight the need for gender-responsive approaches in early screening and policy design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are particularly relevant in a time when both concern for children’s mental health and demand for early intervention are increasing,” Zong says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ observations are based on machine learning and big data. Using an advanced AI approach, the study revealed complex relationships and classified the predictive significance of 14 prenatal and postnatal factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our results, greater investments should be made in preventive care right at the beginning of pregnancy,” Zong points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s emotional and behavioural difficulties are increasing worldwide. The study provides up-to-date information on how early life risk factors, which begin as early as pregnancy and the newborn, can shape children’s mental well-being years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new international study, led by researchers from the University of Helsinki, was conducted in collaboration with Stockholm University, Karolinska Institutet Sweden and the University of Essex (UK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xu Zong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Xu Zong – University of Helsinki&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.04.167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Predicting children’s emotional and behavioural difficulties at age five using pregnancy and neonatal risk factors: Evidence from a longitudinal study of UK households&lt;/a&gt;” by Xu Zong et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting children’s emotional and behavioural difficulties at age five using pregnancy and neonatal risk factors: Evidence from a longitudinal study of UK households&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood emotional and behavioral difficulties have a profound impact on later life outcomes, making it crucial to identify early-life risk factors that predict emotional and behavioral difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, much of the existing research has concentrated on diagnosing, rather than predicting, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and has often focused on adolescents rather than younger children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to construct an interpretable predictive model using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, aiming to identify key risk factors that influence children’s emotional and behavioral difficulties during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined maternal habits during pregnancy and parent-reported data on birth, breastfeeding and regulatory problems during the newborn stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings highlighted lack of breastfeeding, low birthweight and maternal smoking during pregnancy as the three most significant predictors of emotional behavioral difficulties. Other important factors were related to infant regulatory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity analysis revealed gender differences in predictive power, with maternal smoking during pregnancy being a stronger predictor for boys, and the amount of fussing in infancy having a greater impact on girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the importance of comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care, advocates for early screening of emotional and behavioral difficulties, and calls for gender-specific approaches in assessing and addressing emotional and behavioral difficulties in children.&lt;/p&gt;

Institute of Technology, also found another type of tinned pulse—black beans— had a similar cholesterol-lowering effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking of the findings, lead author Professor Morganne Smith urged those with high cholesterol to replace 'less healthy' options with beans—whether canned, dried or frozen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There are a lot of ways to incorporate beans into your regular diet as a cost-effective way to support overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'You can blend them to add some thickness to a soup base, add them as a salad topping, or pair them with other grains like rice.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists believe pulses like chickpeas and beans may boost the levels of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which are thought to be helpful in clearing harmful cholesterol from the blood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584893/Keto-Diet-Study-Shocks-Doctors-Cholesterol-Heart-Killer.html"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is a waxy, fat-like substance that is essential for various bodily functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that eating chickpeas every day significantly improved cholesterol whilst black beans helped to reduce inflammation, pointing to a simple cost-effective way to lower chronic disease risk  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two types—&lt;span&gt;HDL, the good kind, and LDL, too much of which is considered unhealthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An excess of bad cholesterol has long been linked with serious health problems including heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because LDL can form plaques that build up and block arteries, limiting the supply of blood to and from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;An estimated 6.3 million people in the UK are thought to suffer from the condition, which left untreated can develop into type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-644a1a00-4073-11f0-ad1a-01862e9cf4ae" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; as well as heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 12-week study, the results of which were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, 72 prediabetics were analysed to see how introducing beans to daily diets affected their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Heart Foundation, diabetics are around twice as likely to suffer a stroke or develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies estimate that around three quarters of people with diabetes also suffer high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to eat either one cup of black beans, chickpeas, or rice—which was the control group—every day for 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood samples were taken at the start of the study, half-way through and again six weeks later to track&lt;span&gt; cholesterol, blood sugar levels and inflammation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers also carried out a glucose tolerance test at the start and end of the study—measuring participants' response to sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the study those who ate chickpeas daily experienced a significant decrease in cholesterol levels, from 200.4mg per deciliter of blood at the start of the study, to 185.8mg at the end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Total cholesterol levels above 200mg/dl are considered high, while figures below this are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those eating black beans were also found to have lower levels of inflammation after 12 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Our study found that bean consumption helped significantly lower cholesterol and reduce inflammation in people with prediabetes.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Critically, Prof Smith advised people who want to introduce beans into their daily diets to be cautious of any additional ingredients commonly found in the products—such as salt or sugar, both of which have been linked with heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost six million people in the UK have diabetes, of which 90 pre cent is type 2, but charities estimate there 1.2million people are living with disease undiagnosed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They used the &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/CRISPR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; method to insert an archaic variant of the GLI3 gene, which is linked to skeletal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rodents soon showed noticeably altered bone structures and other unexpected traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made possible by scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.h.kpu-m.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; who introduced this ancient DNA segment to assess its role in shaping skeletal anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gli3-gene-and-skeletal-changes"&gt;GLI3 gene and skeletal changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the mice who were edited with the GLI3 gene displayed wider &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/recreating-the-face-of-dragon-man-harbin-skull-denisovans-an-ancient-human-cousin/"&gt;craniums&lt;/a&gt; than their unmodified counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some also presented a reduced number of vertebrae or unusual rib configurations that were consistent with the older genetic template. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew attention to the fact that these modifications were not random anomalies, but specific skeletal features pointing to structural changes once found in extinct hominins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hedgehog pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a key developmental system in mammals, did not show catastrophic disruption in these mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/gli3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;archaic version&lt;/a&gt; of the GLI3 gene quietly adjusted how early bone patterning genes behaved, sparing the animals from severe birth defects yet nudging their skeletons in unexpected directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-background-influences"&gt;Genetic background influences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists noted that these skeletal changes differed depending on each mouse’s broader genetic makeup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mice on one background strain showed extra rib formation at the 14th thoracic position, while others had scoliosis-like rib angles. A fraction exhibited quicker fusion of skull plates, prompting a larger skull shape over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, none of these mice exhibited polydactyly, a trait often linked to major GLI3 gene disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that the archaic variant managed to retain the gene’s essential functions while selectively modifying certain skeletal features, which likely mirrored developmental paths in archaic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-did-humans-start-talking-scientists-may-have-found-the-answer/"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-modern-traces-of-the-gli3-gene"&gt;Modern traces of the GLI3 gene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular GLI3 variant, known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;R1537C&lt;/a&gt;, still appears in some human populations outside Africa at rates between 3.7% and 7.7%, though it is much less common in other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that in ancient groups with smaller population sizes, these changes persisted through genetic drift rather than strict adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small-scale tests involving cultured human cells, the archaic gene shifted expression of certain downstream targets tied to bone growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings back the idea that a subtle but steady influence of archaic traits may endure in the broader human gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-views-on-ancient-dna"&gt;Views on ancient DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-denisovan-species-humans-lived-undisturbed-tibetan-plateau-160000-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, both prehistoric relatives of modern humans, occasionally contributed genes to our ancestors. The presence of archaic DNA in living humans has been linked to various traits, including some skeletal features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly edited mice offered a concrete glimpse of how small genetic differences might have forged physical contrasts among ancient populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/03082319/mice_neanderthal-dna_GLI3-gene_altered-morphology_credit-KPUM_1m.webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/03082309/mice_neanderthal-dna_GLI3-gene_altered-morphology_credit-KPMU_1s.webp" alt="Altered skeletal morphology of the mice carrying a Neanderthal/Denisovan type GLI3 variant(A) Structures of modern human or extinct hominins GLI3, wild type mouse Gli3 (Gli31540R), and mouse Gli3 with a Neanderthal/Denisovans variant (Gli31540C).

That statement highlights how subtle gene tweaks can mold skeletal architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-gli3-gene-matters"&gt;Why the GLI3 gene matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLI3 protein sits at the crossroads of multiple developmental processes, but it is especially vital for shaping bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on the GLI3 gene have revealed its involvement in conditions where limb or craniofacial structures form atypically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those disorders arise when the gene is fully inactivated, a far cry from this single amino acid switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1225829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;examinations&lt;/a&gt; of other archaic DNA segments examined immunity and even pain responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This updated research extends such work into the realm of skeletal differences, showing that one minor coding change can produce noticeable effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also underscores how ancient DNA, when tested in living models, provides a clear window on long-lost biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skeletal-insights-from-extinct-dna"&gt;Skeletal insights from extinct DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists who work with extinct &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/115000-year-old-human-footprints-found-alathar-lake-arabian-peninsula/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; DNA rely on fossils and advanced genomics to piece together the puzzle of our origins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet skeletal remains alone cannot show how each gene variant behaved during development. Rodent models like these can fill that gap, offering a living system to track gene function in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights how archaic changes, buried in genetic code for tens of thousands of years, can still produce phenotypic impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if many such variations fell out of circulation, remnants linger in some modern genomes, adding subtle diversity to our species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more investigation is needed to confirm whether this arcane variant ever delivered a clear advantage for extinct populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some evidence from biobank data suggests connections to spinal traits, but the small numbers make firm conclusions tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the success of this gene-editing work brings fresh awareness of our shared evolutionary links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new findings emerge, scientists will be better positioned to understand how each archaic segment contributed to the ancient &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/homo-juluensis-new-human-species-vanished-just-fifty-thousand-years-ago/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form, and what it might still mean for people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2333268/bio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Ako Agata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tadashi-Nomura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Tadashi Nomura&lt;/a&gt; at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine who led this important and fascinating study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.03.547394v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:28:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPeHFPSm9NMkFYWHlJNzJObjIzblNBZVpfVWZHbTExVElzVG5nOUZKTlpOaUYwN3NsczRnQzhPeE1QZng0MkpCQ29qTlRPeW02X1l2UGVjcWtidU83UjRsNnNxY0l2c3V0dkpGZDVCaTJJS1lWRG5WMHA1a01Tbll3bGtKLTlNY3I0cHBrNVMwSjdDSkVUUHdPMTNxSkJ0ci1PS1VjblpNMTFXbEFSS29PeDhnZXF2My1NSmExLQ</guid></item><item><title>您的TRICARE搬家清单- TRICARE新闻室(.mil) | Your TRICARE Checklist for Moving - TRICARE Newsroom (.mil)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNXVrQXl4WmJNMWxrdTF2VzNoNGcyZHU2cnlSLUNUbUdOZXJlUzZlMUZ4SVc0WFIxenZYU3VVeXlmVG0wX0JxTnZCVnhKSXMxYUZUN18tS0t0Vk1kdGxKb21wTWNkelpaekxwcE1VcS1yMW9ZQ0JaT05nM0xTTTVpVWFodmUtNV9vYncyRjczaUc3UmZreFQtSWtVQmk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
            &lt;span class="dateline-text"&gt;
                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Are you preparing to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/moving"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to a new location? Now is the best time to make sure your TRICARE benefits are ready to move with you.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can use TRICARE wherever you live, but there are actions you can take to help avoid interruptions to your health care and TRICARE benefits,” said Dr. Danita Hunter, chief, TRICARE Health Plan Policy &amp;amp; Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “Before you move, learn about what these actions are and how your health plan options may change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a TRICARE checklist to help you prepare for your move and what you may need to do after you get to your new location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Check out TRICARE’s Moving page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE’s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/moving"&gt;Moving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; page has general information about what do before and after you move. The page also has summaries of what you need to do based on which health plan you’re enrolled in before you move. Depending on your plan, you’ll learn:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/regions"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you’re able to transfer your TRICARE Prime enrollment before you move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which health plan you have, keep these things in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Don’t disenroll from any plan before you move. You’re covered by your current plan on your way to your new location.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Update your address and other contact information in the &lt;a href="https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/" target="_blank"&gt;Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; you move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Learn how your health plan options might change. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/HealthPlans"&gt;TRICARE health plans&lt;/a&gt; you qualify for may change when you move. For example, your eligibility for TRICARE Prime can change based on who you are and where you move to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/PlanFinder"&gt;Plan Finder&lt;/a&gt; to see which plans you may qualify for in your new location. Not sure which plan is right for you? You can use the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/ComparePlans"&gt;Compare Plans Tool&lt;/a&gt; to compare the features of different plans side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving is sometimes a &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/LifeEvents"&gt;TRICARE Qualifying Life Event&lt;/a&gt;. Relocation must be to a new country, city, region, or ZIP+4 code to be a QLE. You have 90 days from the date of your address change in DEERS to &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/enroll"&gt;change your health plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get health services and request copies of your health records.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you move, catch up on getting your routine care and specialty care, if needed. Be sure to discuss any ongoing health issues and prescriptions with your current &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pcm"&gt;primary care manager&lt;/a&gt;, primary care provider, or specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any active &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/referrals"&gt;referrals&lt;/a&gt;? These referrals will still be valid in your new location. (&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/4170061/defense-health-agency-extends-referral-approval-waiver-through-june-30-for-west"&gt;current referral approval waiver&lt;/a&gt; in the West Region.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you move, call the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/regions"&gt;regional contractor&lt;/a&gt; for your current location to request your referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your referrals won’t be transferred unless you or your provider requests this. Once you set up your enrollment with your new regional contractor, you can ask the contractor to help you find a provider. The contractor may also be able to help make your first appointment with a new specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any civilian medical or dental providers, be sure to ask for copies of your records to take with you. Talk to your &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/partners"&gt;TRICARE contractor&lt;/a&gt; for more information on requesting and transferring records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a service member under permanent change of station orders? Ensure you out-process at your military hospital or clinic. You can also request to transfer your family members’ health records to the military hospital or clinic at your new duty station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Fill prescriptions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have enough of your medication to last during and immediately after your move. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/FillPrescriptions"&gt;filling prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After you move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Update your contact information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After you move, update your address and contact information in DEERS as soon as possible. Up-to-date DEERS records are vital to accessing your TRICARE benefits. Incorrect addresses can cause issues with eligibility, claims, billing, authorization letters for referrals, and filling prescriptions. Learn how to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/deers"&gt;update your DEERS record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many TRICARE plans, you should also update your contact information with the regional contractor for your new location. (If you pay enrollment fees or premiums, it is also a good time to check with your regional contractor to see if you need to make any updates to your payment method.) Go to &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/moving"&gt;Moving&lt;/a&gt; and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do. You don’t need to do this if you have TRICARE For Life, as described in the &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/Publications/Handbooks/tricare_for_life"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRICARE For Life Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you enrolled in the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/tdp"&gt;TRICARE Dental Program&lt;/a&gt;? You should &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/partners"&gt;call the TDP contractor&lt;/a&gt;, United Concordia, to update your contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Change your health plan within 90 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved? If so, you must enroll in a new health plan within 90 days of updating your address in DEERS. If you don’t, you’ll only be eligible for care and pharmacy services at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available. After 90 days, you can only enroll in a plan after another &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/lifeevents"&gt;TRICARE QLE&lt;/a&gt; or during &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/openseason"&gt;TRICARE Open Season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Choose a new primary care manager or find a provider.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a TRICARE Prime plan, you may need to &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pcm"&gt;choose a new primary care manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/GettingCare/FindDoctor"&gt;Find a Doctor Tool&lt;/a&gt; to search for a new provider. If you’re looking for providers in the U.S., be sure to enter the ZIP code for your new location to make sure you get to the right provider directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Update your TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery mailing address.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you get prescriptions through &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/homedelivery"&gt;TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery&lt;/a&gt;? Be sure to update your mailing address with the &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy"&gt;TRICARE Pharmacy Program&lt;/a&gt; contractor, Express Scripts. Keep in mind that there are different rules for using home delivery outside the U.S. and U.S. territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to prepare your TRICARE coverage to move with you will help you and your family have a smooth transition. Visit the &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/moving"&gt;Moving&lt;/a&gt; page to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Drawing on data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults, researchers found the strongest and most consistent protective effects among African American, Latino, and White participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who improved their diet over a decade experienced up to a 25% lower dementia risk, regardless of age. While results were less pronounced among Asian American and Native Hawaiian participants, the study reinforces that adopting a brain-healthy diet can benefit cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIND Diet Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Adherence to the MIND diet reduced dementia risk by 9% overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvement Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Those who improved their diet over time saw a 25% lower risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subgroup Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Strongest effects observed in African American, Latino, and White groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the U.S. population ages and dementia cases rise, many people are asking whether it is possible to prevent this devastating disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, the answer may be on your plate: People who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were significantly less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110604"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg.webp 656w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg" alt="This shows food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg 656w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years (including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first) had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. This trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet, which stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, combines the Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and also emphasizes proven brain-healthy foods like leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other healthy diets, although the relationship varied among five racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who improved their adherence to the diet the most over time showed the greatest pattern of risk reduction. This beneficial relationship was seen similarly among younger and older groups, suggesting that there are benefits to adopting the diet at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life and their improvement over time may prevent Alzheimer’s and related dementias,” said Song-Yi Park, PhD, associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park and colleagues analyzed data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who provided information about their diet as part of a research cohort known as the Multiethnic Cohort Study starting in the 1990s. Participants were between 45-75 years old at baseline and over 21,000 developed Alzheimer’s or related dementias in the years that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants who scored higher for MIND adherence at baseline had a 9%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower risk of dementia, with an even greater reduction—around 13%—among those who identified as African American, Latino or White. Baseline MIND diet adherence was not associated with a significant risk reduction among Native Hawaiian or Asian American participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the protective relationship between a healthy diet and dementia was more pronounced among African Americans, Latinos and Whites, while it was not as apparent among Asian Americans and showed a weaker trend in Native Hawaiians,” said Park. “A tailored approach may be needed when evaluating different subpopulations’ diet quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years (including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first) had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. This trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that differences in dietary patterns and preferences among racial and ethnic groups could play a role in the variation they observed in the dementia-diet relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Asian Americans also experience lower rates of dementia than other groups, it is possible that the MIND diet may not reflect the advantages of diets that are more common among this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park said that further studies could help to clarify these patterns and added that interventional studies would be needed to verify cause and effect since the study was based on observational data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf6fefff2fadbf5eeefe9f2eff2f4f5b5f4e9fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nancy Lamontagne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nancy Lamontagne – American Society for Nutrition&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at NUTRITION 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE10LS1jWFN1Um9QNmlRS3NuTXI3enkxZHVZZC1ETUg1Zk92ZnY3M1pwSkp4WnRMY3h3bEZNS21pWldfOTA3aGZlY1Rja1NZWkNtNEVTRTlqV3lmRnRtVC1CZ1lBaGNzT1Bt</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，在黑死病背后的细菌中发现的基因突变帮助瘟疫征服了世界 | Gene mutation found in the bacterium behind the Black Death helped plague conquer the world, scientists say - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFA2VGZiOTR6emFON0lqRHRkS1lINUpBVDR4YzFIRU1CLThHaGxWQ0t4cThKUFdPV2cwMlZSbEU5V0N2aXdzYUowRXhqX3hIMURDVkk3SERrWTd4OXRRNDlBR0FZOWFONW9zWmtYYtIBckFVX3lxTFA4VXU4TXl1RVFiZ1ExSlNVMWNvaXluZWpMSGN2Mm9qTFJhQ0lMZmtGeW9DSTZGSGhtcVMwZ0hLMXZsVFh5dUV0T09QbGgxQklSNlZ2eUhEeld5N1V6X04zY3BuZEptbmMwX3FaOElrZkxhdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            One of the bleakest periods in medieval Europe was the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/20/world/plague-bacterium-strain-black-death-intl-scli-scn"&gt;plague pandemic&lt;/a&gt; known as the Black Death, which killed at least 25 million people in just five years. But the disease didn’t stop there. The plague adapted to keep its hosts alive longer, so it could spread farther and keep infecting people for centuries, and researchers now say they’ve discovered how.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10002356mpkwk5wfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which has been circulating among human populations for at least &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7920731/" target="_blank"&gt;5,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. The pathogen has fueled three major plague pandemics since the first century AD, and though its deadliest years appear to be behind us, plague hasn’t disappeared. Cases still occur a few times a year in Asia, South America and the United States and more commonly in parts of Africa,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and can be treated with antibiotics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10003356mk3ki7mou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists are still searching for answers about how Y. pestis evolved and dispersed, but recent analysis of ancient and modern Y. pestis samples revealed how plague managed to persist among humans for hundreds of years after pandemic waves petered out. After an initial period of high infection rates and rapid mortality — killing infected people within three days — changes to just one gene in the bacterium produced new strains that were less deadly and more transmissible, according to research published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt3880" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10004356m9ni2vni9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those weakened strains eventually went extinct; the dominant lineage of today’s Y. pestis is the deadlier variety, the study authors reported. However, these findings about historic instances of Y. pestis adaptation could provide important clues to help scientists and physicians manage modern plague outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10005356m243kon51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plague’s most common form is bubonic plague, which causes painful swelling in lymph nodes and spreads among people through bites from fleas hitchhiking on infected rats. An outbreak of bubonic plague from 1347 to 1352 in Europe famously killed about 30% to 50% of the continent’s population. But the earliest known bubonic plague outbreak — the Plague of Justinian — took hold in the Mediterranean Basin and lasted from AD 541 to AD 544. Another plague outbreak emerged in China in the 1850s and sparked a major epidemic in 1894. Scientists view modern plague cases as part of this third pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10006356mgsgt0w2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new study, scientists collected ancient samples of Y. pestis from human remains dating back to about 100 years after the appearance of the first and second plague pandemics, sampling remains from Denmark, Europe and Russia. After reconstructing the genomes of these plague strains, they compared them with older, ancient strains that dated back to the start of plague pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbgk8fgi00023b6mp9q524ui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also examined more than 2,700 genomes of modern plague samples from Asia, Africa, and North and South America. One of the study coauthors, Jennifer Klunk, is a product scientist at Daciel Arbor Biosciences, a biotechnology company in Michigan that provided synthetically created molecules for the experiments, but there was no financial gain associated with the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10007356mbtgwedhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that their newly reconstructed genomes from 100 years into the first two plague pandemics had fewer copies of a gene called pla&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which has been recognized for decades as one of the factors that made plague so deadly, according to the study’s co-lead author Ravneet Sidhu, a doctoral student in the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10008356mtlza671q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;encodes an enzyme that interacts with host proteins, “and one of the functions that it carries out is in breaking down blood clots,” Sidhu told CNN. This ability helps Y. pestis spread into the host’s lymph nodes, where it replicates before attacking the rest of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10009356mgzp0oz8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Not every function of this gene is fully known,” Sidhu added. However, prior studies by other researchers linked pla to severity of illness caused by both bubonic and pneumonic plague — an airborne form of the disease that affects the lungs, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000a356mb1yx7iuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the reconstructed strains showed fewer  copies of the pla  gene, the scientists were still uncertain      whether that would directly affect how deadly the  disease could be. So they tested strains of reduced-pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bubonic plague on mice, and found that survival rates for this type of plague were 10 to 20 percent           higher in those experiment  subjects than in mice infected with Y. pestis that had a normal amount of the pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gene. It also took the reconstructed bubonic strain about two days longer to kill its  hosts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000b356msvxr0j11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The paper presents a strong argument that depletion, but not total loss, of Pla (the enzyme produced by the pla gene) is part of the evolution of the plague pathogen and may help explain the decline of plague in the second pandemic commonly known as the Black Death,” said Dr. Deborah Anderson, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at the University of Missouri’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Anderson, who was not involved in the new research, investigates the virulence of plague, and these findings could shed light on transmission patterns in modern cases, she told CNN in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000c356me2g7o1p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our laboratory studies the   flea-rodent cycle and we have collaborators who conduct field research in   areas that experience annual or occasional plague outbreaks in the   wild,” Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000d356m1mr8wtww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are nearly 300 rodent species that can transmit Yersinia pestis, and today, burrowing rodents such as prairie dogs or ground squirrels are considered key animal hosts that experience outbreaks of disease,” she added. “After reading this paper, we will pay closer attention to Pla in the future to see if there continues to be a role for its expression in driving the explosive outbreaks of plague in the animal populations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000e356ml4cx4wqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mathematical models suggested how this might have played out in human populations centuries ago, leading to an “epidemic burnout” about 100 years after a bubonic plague outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbgklmmh00043b6myjmulbtb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a pandemic’s early stages, infections were swift, and death came quickly for both rats and humans. Over time, as dense rat populations thinned out, selective pressures favored the emergence of a less deadly strain of Y. pestis, with fewer copies of the pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gene. Rat hosts infected with this new strain would have a little more time to carry the disease, potentially enabling them to infect more rats — and more people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000f356mxaj6cbqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They  suggest a model that can be readily pursued in the laboratory that may help  explain the spread of plague today in the wild,”      Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000g356mgbjx0hyz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These weaker strains of the disease eventually sputtered out and went extinct. In the modern samples, the researchers found just three examples of strains with reduced pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;genes, from Vietnam: one from a human subject and two from black rats (Rattus rattus).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000h356m0wilemye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been able to do this really cool interdisciplinary study between the modern and ancient data and marry these things that have been happening throughout (the plague’s) long evolutionary history,” Sidhu said. “It could be interesting to see how future researchers continue to try and bridge that gap between the modern third pandemic and those first and second ancient pandemics, to see other similarities. Because there aren’t a lot of ancient pathogens that we have as much data on, as we do for Yersinia pestis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000i356moygu9gfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the unusual features of plague pandemics is their persistence, and understanding how Y. pestis changed its infection patterns and survived over time could shed light on the adaptive patterns of modern pandemics such as Covid-19, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000j356mt9awe594@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if we aren’t experiencing it to the amount that we were in 2020 or 2021, the pathogen is in the background — still evolving and persisting.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

In some cases, seizures occurred up to 10 years before an FTD diagnosis, highlighting a potentially overlooked early symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed over 12,000 medical records and found that epilepsy was more frequent in FTD patients compared to those with Alzheimer’s or healthy controls. These findings suggest that better screening for epilepsy in FTD could improve diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Early Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; Epileptic seizures can occur up to a decade before FTD diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; FTD patients had significantly higher rates of epilepsy than those with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing seizures may improve function and life quality in FTD patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Eastern Finland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to a recent study, in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), epileptic seizures are significantly more common than previously known. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery deepens understanding of the symptoms of this memory disorder and emphasises the importance of taking epileptic seizures into account in the treatment and monitoring of patients.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." class="wp-image-110600" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/FTD-epilepsy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordinated by Neurocenter Finland, this major project by the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu examined the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research dataset is one of the largest in the world, and the results have been published in the prestigious &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology &lt;/em&gt;journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilepsy occurred years before the FTD diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. The newly published study fills this information gap and shows that epilepsy is considerably more common in patients with FTD than previously estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analysed patient data from the university hospitals of Kuopio and Oulu from the period 2010–2021. Out of a total of 12,490 medical records, the study identified 245 patients with FTD and 1,326 patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to examining the prevalence of epilepsy in these patients, the prevalence was also examined in healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that epilepsy is considerably more common among those with FTD than those with Alzheimer’s disease or in healthy controls,” says Doctoral Researcher Annemari Kilpeläinen, the first author of the research article and a medical specialist in neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is noteworthy that epilepsy occurred in some patients with FTD already ten years before their dementia diagnosis, and it was more common in all the examined stages of the disease than previous international studies have reported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of epilepsy was assessed at several time points from ten years before to five years after the dementia diagnosis. In patients with FTD, the prevalence of epilepsy increased over time, and five years after the diagnosis approximately 11% had epilepsy. In addition to epilepsy diagnoses, medications used for epilepsy were more common in patients with FTD, which strengthens the reliability of the results.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilepsy might be left undiagnosed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing epilepsy in patients with FTD may be challenging as the symptoms of the disease may resemble epileptic seizures. This may lead to underdiagnosis and delays in treatment. However, untreated epilepsy can significantly worsen patients’ condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying epilepsy is important because its treatment can improve patients’ functional capacity and quality of life. Knowledge about the association between epilepsy and FTD raises new research questions: do these diseases share some pathophysiological mechanisms and could some FTD symptoms be caused by alterations in the specific electrical systems of the brain”, says the project’s principal investigator, Associate Professor and Director of UEF Brain Research Unit Eino Solje.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An extensive research project brings together different fields of science&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently published study is part of an extensive project that combines exceptionally extensive real-life patient data with different kinds of unique registers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project involves a strong cooperation between the University of Oulu and the University of Eastern Finland as well as different fields of science, including between researchers in the fields of medicine and law. Kuopio University Hospital and Oulu University Hospital are part of the international European Reference Network &lt;em&gt;EpiCARE&lt;/em&gt; and recognised centres in the field of epilepsy treatment and research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this epilepsy and FTD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#93fef2f9bde5e6fce1e1f6d3e6f6f5bdf5fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maj Vuorre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uef.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Eastern Finland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Maj Vuorre – University of Eastern Finland&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prevalence of Epilepsy in Frontotemporal Dementia and Timing of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Annemari Kilpeläinen et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevalence of Epilepsy in Frontotemporal Dementia and Timing of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have described a potential association between epilepsy and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but no systematic data are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether epilepsy is more prevalent in patients with FTD than in healthy controls (HCs) or patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case-control study, we compared the prevalence of epilepsy and purchases of antiseizure medicines (ASMs) among patients with FTD, matched HCs, and patients with AD from 2 early-onset dementia diagnostics centers in the same geographic regions of Finland. AD or FTD diagnoses were made between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from January 26, 2024, to January 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was to describe the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD, covering the time period from 10 years before to 5 years after the FTD diagnosis. We used &lt;em&gt;International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision&lt;/em&gt; codes to identify all patients with epilepsy and tracked purchases of ASMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study cohort included 245 patients with FTD (121 female [49.4%], 124 male [50.6%]; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [8.7] years), 2416 matched HCs (1190 female [49.3%], 1226 male [50.7%]; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [8.5] years), and 1326 patients with AD (777 female [58.6%], 549 male [41.4%]; mean [SD] age, 71.7 [9.8] years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of epilepsy was higher in the FTD group compared with the HC group (3.3% vs 0.8%, respectively; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .002) and AD group (3.3% vs 1.4%, respectively; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01) 10 years before FTD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the year of the diagnosis, the prevalence was 6.5% in patients with FTD, 1.8% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 4.7 percentage points [ppt] [95% CI, 2.2-8.6 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), and 5.0% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 1.6 ppt [95% CI, −1.2 to 5.5 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .32); at 5 years after the diagnosis, the prevalence was 11.2% in patients with FTD, 2.2% in HCs (FTD vs HC difference, 9.0 ppt [95% CI, 5.0-14.6 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), and 6.9% in patients with AD (FTD vs AD difference, 4.2 ppt [95% CI, 0-10.0 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASM purchases were made significantly more often among patients with FTD (10.2%) compared with HCs (1.8%) and patients with AD (4.2%) (FTD vs HC difference, 8.4 ppt [95% CI, 5.2-12.9 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; FTD vs AD difference, 6.1 ppt [95% CI, 2.6-10.6 ppt]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) at all time points and increased during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case-control study found a higher prevalence of epilepsy and increased ASM use among patients with FTD compared with HCs and patients with AD , suggesting an association between epileptic abnormalities and the pathophysiology of FTD. Further studies are warranted to investigate a potential overlap in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:38:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBYYmpEQTVoRGpfWmhhRnBhVFk5OVNrNmVGVzBQdFA4RTdfZGJjLWhBb3BhWl81V2FkNDlfS21xbTByeThPY2hZeGNVZmsxLS1fM1pTQ1hkM29aSC1YUjl4M1BVemM2YmFEblE</guid></item><item><title>为什么美国饮食如此致命？沉默的杀手安静地伤害数百万人-印度国防评论 | Why the American Diet Is So Deadly?

&lt;p&gt;Guillaume Raineri, a forty-two-year-old former HVAC technician from Gonesse, a small town just north of Paris, found himself facing an unexpected challenge when he moved to the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt;. The food in his new home, Bethesda, Maryland, where his wife worked at the &lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/strong&gt;, was different—larger portions, more salt, and excessive sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Curious about the effects of this new &lt;strong&gt;diet&lt;/strong&gt;, Raineri enrolled in a four-week &lt;strong&gt;study&lt;/strong&gt; at the NIH Clinical Center designed to investigate why the American diet leads to such high rates of &lt;strong&gt;weight gain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Controlled Experiment in the NIH Metabolic Ward&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the NIH Clinical Center, the world’s largest hospital dedicated to scientific &lt;strong&gt;research&lt;/strong&gt;, Raineri spent his days in a room fitted with a narrow hospital bed, a blue recliner, and an exercise bike. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/why-is-the-american-diet-so-deadly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, each morning, afternoon, and evening, he was served large meals—around two thousand &lt;strong&gt;calories&lt;/strong&gt; each—and could eat as much as he wished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For the first week, his diet consisted of minimally &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/the-worlds-leading-longevity-expert-reveals-four-foods-he-would-never-eat-they-are-a-recipe-for-failure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71418" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; like salads, vegetables, and grilled chicken, and he reported feeling well. But as the weeks progressed, researchers switched him to ultra-processed foods—chicken nuggets, fries, and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. “They just sat in my stomach,” Raineri said. He experienced heartburn, &lt;strong&gt;bloating&lt;/strong&gt;, and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, Raineri underwent regular metabolic tests, including time inside a &lt;strong&gt;metabolic chamber&lt;/strong&gt; measuring how his body used energy and burned calories. The researchers also tracked his eating speed and &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/every-dog-owners-dream-a-drug-that-could-add-more-years-to-your-best-friends-life/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71880" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hormone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;related to appetite. The findings were clear: on the ultra-processed diet, participants like Raineri consumed about five hundred more calories daily, gained weight, and showed metabolic changes including higher &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Redefining Nutrition: The Role of Food Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hall, the study’s principal investigator and a former physicist turned nutrition researcher at NIH, challenged the traditional focus on nutrients like salt, fat, and sugar. Instead, his research emphasized the impact of industrial food &lt;strong&gt;processing&lt;/strong&gt;. Ultra-processed foods are often chemically modified, containing ingredients that cannot be made in a home kitchen. Hall explained, “We’re starting to learn that processing really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This concept, introduced by Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro, categorizes foods into four groups based on processing. Group 1 includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like nuts and vegetables. Group 4 encompasses ultra-processed products, which include &lt;strong&gt;additives&lt;/strong&gt;, preservatives, and artificial substances designed to enhance flavor, shelf life, and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While critics argue that the category can lump together very different products—like canned beans and gummy bears—the growing body of research links ultra-processed foods to higher risks of high blood pressure, heart attacks, certain cancers, and &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/married-to-an-ai-chatbot-women-opens-up-about-their-deep-bond-and-unique-sex-life/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80872" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health &lt;/a&gt;issues such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/24-year-olds-controversial-theory-on-gen-zs-depression-goes-viral-sparking-heated-debate/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73744" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The effects are often attributed to factors like energy density and &lt;strong&gt;hyper-palatability&lt;/strong&gt;—the irresistible combination of fat, sugar, and salt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unraveling the Gut Microbiome’s Response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlighted how ultra-processed foods affect the &lt;strong&gt;microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;, the community of bacteria living in our digestive system. Katherine Maki, a clinician and microbiome researcher working with Hall, described how a lack of dietary &lt;strong&gt;fiber&lt;/strong&gt;—consumed by ninety-five percent of Americans—causes beneficial bacteria like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to consume the gut’s mucus lining instead, potentially leading to &lt;strong&gt;inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners found in many “no-sugar-added” products can further disrupt gut bacteria, impairing the body’s ability to regulate sugar. This decline in microbial diversity has coincided with the global spread of &lt;strong&gt;Western diets&lt;/strong&gt; and may contribute to broader health problems beyond digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Industrial Food Production and the Gray Area of Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Seviroli Foods’ headquarters an hour and a half east of Manhattan, the production of pasta and sauces illustrated the complexity of food processing. Franco LaRocca, the company’s corporate chef and vice-president of research and development, described how the factory produces millions of pounds of stuffed pasta annually, using enriched &lt;strong&gt;semolina flour&lt;/strong&gt; mixed with ingredients like guar gum and cornstarch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LaRocca noted that while their products are processed, Seviroli limits additives and avoids &lt;strong&gt;hydrogenated oils&lt;/strong&gt;. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University, explained that industrial production alone does not define ultra-processed foods: “It has to have the purpose of replacing real food… and, usually, to be loaded with additives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Nestle emphasized that some products, such as whole-wheat breads made from highly processed flours, fall into the ultra-processed category despite appearing healthy. She compared whole-fat &lt;strong&gt;yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;, made from milk and bacterial cultures, to low-fat versions that include emulsifiers and thickeners, highlighting the nuances in processing and health impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Navigating the Challenge Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH study and subsequent research have sparked debate among nutrition experts. Walter Willett, a prominent Harvard professor and critic of the ultra-processed food classification, described some studies as “misleading” and cautioned against oversimplifying dietary recommendations. Yet, the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in the American diet—estimated to be about two-thirds of what people eat—raises questions about their role in public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Efforts to regulate ultra-processed food consumption, including marketing restrictions and &lt;strong&gt;taxation&lt;/strong&gt;, are being explored in some countries, but the complex relationship between diet, biology, and the food industry remains a challenge for scientists, policymakers, and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

Women between the ages of 50 and 65 who scored high on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were 16% more likely to die from any cause, even after adjusting for health and demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association was not observed in younger or older women. Researchers suggest this may point to hormonal or metabolic changes in midlife that influence vulnerability to sleep-related health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Daytime sleepiness was only linked to mortality in women aged 50–65.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantified Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; High Epworth scores raised mortality odds by 16% in midlife women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings hint at unique hormonal or metabolic factors in this age group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AASM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality in middle-aged women but not in younger or older women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that the adjusted odds of all-cause mortality were 16% higher in women between the ages of 50 and 65 years who had high scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, compared with women who had normal levels of sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sitting down." class="wp-image-110596" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to Maghsoudi, it is noteworthy that there was no association between excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in older women who tend to have more comorbidities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and comorbidities. No significant associations were observed in younger women or older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying middle age as a critical period suggests clinicians should prioritize an Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessment and excessive daytime sleepiness management in women approaching their 50s and early 60s,” said lead author Arash Maghsoudi, who has a doctorate in biomedical engineering and is an instructor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleepiness is a critical patient-reported outcome that is associated with increased risk for adverse health effects and diminished quality of life, according to an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement. Excessive sleepiness is defined as the inability to stay awake and alert during the major waking episodes of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 40,250 female veterans from 1999 to 2022, focusing on individuals who had a sleep disorder or had received sleep-related care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sample had a mean age of 48 years. Clinical notes were analyzed to extract scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a validated natural language processing tool that assesses the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep during routine daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Maghsoudi, it is noteworthy that there was no association between excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in older women who tend to have more comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It implies hormonal, metabolic, or resilience factors that warrant mechanistic follow-up for women in middle age,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health; the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety, which is a combined Baylor College of Medicine Section in the Department of Medicine and a VA Health Systems Research Center of Innovation funded by a center grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the Michael E.

While having too much sodium is linked to high blood pressure, potassium causes you to lose sodium through your urine, Dr. Chang explains. &lt;br data-node-id="14.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Not only that, potassium can help to ease tension in the walls of your blood vessels, lowering blood pressure as a result, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cheng-Han Chen, M.D.," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While decreasing sodium may also be necessary, adding more potassium can be an easier dietary tweak for some people to make, Dr. Chang says. “Lowering blood pressure by decreasing sodium intake can be difficult and may be unsuccessful because of the high sodium content in modern diets and many of the foods available to us in supermarkets,” he says. “Blood pressure lowering may be greater with potassium intake because the addition of potassium-rich foods may be an easier adjustment for people to make than the elimination of high sodium foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-potassium-do-i-need" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;How much potassium do I need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Recommended potassium intakes vary slightly by person. However, most adult women should aim to have 2,600 milligrams of potassium a day, while most adult men should strive for 3,400 milligrams daily, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH).

These are some of the biggest sources, per the NIH:&lt;br data-node-id="20.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.0"&gt;     Dried apricots, ½ cup (755 milligrams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.1"&gt;     Lentils, 1 cup (731 milligrams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.2"&gt;     Mashed acorn squash, 1 cup (644 milligrams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.3"&gt;     Dried prunes, ½ cup (635 milligrams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.4"&gt;     Kidney beans, 1 cup (607 milligrams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.5"&gt;     Banana, 1 medium (422 milligrams) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="other-steps-you-can-take-to-lower-blood-pressure" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Other steps you can take to lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Cording recommends taking a close look at sneaky sources of sodium in your diet. “Ninety-nine percent of the time it’s more ultra-processed foods, restaurant foods, and things like sauces and condiments,” she says. “But even some healthier foods like olives, pickles, sauerkraut, and cheese can contribute.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Blood pressure is complicated, and there’s often more to lowering it than just making dietary tweaks, Dr. Chen says. “There are a lot of lifestyle changes we would make beyond just making a healthy, [balanced] diet low in sodium and high in potassium,” he says. That’s why it’s important to have a personalized conversation with your healthcare provider, but some of those changes may include getting regular exercise, trying to maintain a healthy weight, getting good quality sleep, and doing your best to control your cholesterol and blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Together, those are the best chances people have of keeping their blood pressure under control,” Dr. Chen says.

Samples from the location, which has not been disclosed, were submitted to the Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Lab for preliminary determination. The results were then submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for confirmation and received on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs produced after the signs of the virus did not enter the food supply, and there have been no signs of illness in humans, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the general public is considered to be low, with those most at risk of exposure being individuals who are directly involved with the daily care of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/poultry-at-hickmans-family-farms-tests-positive-for-avian-flu"&gt;poultry at Hickman's Family Farms&lt;/a&gt; was infected.

Women who drank regular coffee were more likely to avoid chronic disease, cognitive decline, and physical impairment later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits did not extend to tea or decaffeinated coffee, while soda consumption was associated with worse aging outcomes. Researchers emphasize that moderate coffee consumption may be a helpful part of an overall healthy lifestyle but note that genetics and other factors play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Source Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Only caffeinated coffee—not tea, decaf, or soda—was linked to better aging outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modest Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Each additional daily cup of coffee in midlife correlated with a 2–5% higher chance of healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soda Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; More soda intake was tied to a 20–26% &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; chance of healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings from a new study of almost 50,000 women followed for 30 years suggest that a morning cup of coffee might do more than boost energy; it could also help women stay sharp, strong and mentally well as they age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that women who drank caffeinated coffee in midlife were more likely to exhibit healthy aging. However, the researchers didn’t find any links with tea or decaf coffee, while drinking more cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110588"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman drinking coffee." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Healthy aging was defined as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, having good mental health, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” said Dr. Sara Mahdavi, BSc, HBSc, RD, MSc, PhD, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, and an adjunct professor at University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nutritional Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee—not tea or decaf—may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study has several key strengths,” said Dr. Mahdavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to the large sample size and 30 years of follow-up, we assessed several different aspects of longevity and healthy aging as well as very comprehensive information on nutritional and lifestyle habits that were collected every four years after the initiation of the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 47,513 women from the Nurses’ Health Study with dietary and health data collected since 1984. The researchers assessed caffeine intake using validated food frequency questionnaires that included consumption of top contributors of caffeine such as coffee, tea, cola and decaffeinated coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging was defined as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, having good mental health, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 30 years of follow-up, the investigators estimated how the likelihood of healthy aging changed for every 80 mg of caffeine that study participants consumed per day. They also examined specific drinks like coffee, tea, decaffeinated coffee (per 8-ounce cup) and cola (per 12-ounce glass).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These preliminary analyses accounted for other factors that might influence healthy aging such as body weight, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, education level and protein in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2016, 3,706 of the women in the study met all the requirements for being considered healthy agers. In mid-life, ages 45-60, these women typically consumed an average of 315 mg of caffeine per day — roughly the amount in three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of that caffeine came from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women in the healthy agers group, each extra cup of coffee per day was tied to a 2% to 5% higher chance of doing well later in life, up to five small cups per day, or about 2.5 cups according to today’s measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not find any significant association between drinking decaffeinated coffee or tea with an increased likelihood of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, each additional small glass of soda—another major source of caffeine—was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that not all sources of caffeine confer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” said Dr. Mahdavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy aging, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that, in general, up to two cups of coffee per day should be safe and potentially beneficial for most people. Beyond that, drinking more may offer additional benefits for some but may not be healthy for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study, Dr. Mahdavi and colleagues have shown that genetic variation can influence the relationship between caffeine intake and health outcomes, so more caffeine isn’t always better, particularly for people with lower caffeine tolerance or specific genetic susceptibility (Mahdavi et al, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, coffee contains a range of compounds that could act synergistically to influence aging pathways. To better understand these effects, researchers plan to investigate how specific bioactive compounds in coffee interact with genetic and metabolic aging markers, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these mechanisms could guide personalized medicine approaches to develop diets that support longevity and cognitive health for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A pharmacist has warned that drinking coffee can be harmful for thousands of people who take common medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes those on thyroid medication, SSRI antidepressants, drugs for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-15ba0f90-4072-11f0-8a0e-7dc8da85b0d6"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and even over-the-counter decongestants for cold and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-15bb4810-4072-11f0-8a0e-7dc8da85b0d6"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The energy-boosting drink can also make life-saving heart medication less effective, increasing the risk of a deadly irregular heartbeat, according to pharmacy expert at Kingston University, Dipa Kamda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in other cases, caffeine can interact with prescription drugs, causing a range of debilitating symptoms such as insomnia, headaches, fast heart rate, raised blood drowsiness, confusion, and even stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While your morning brew might feel harmless, it can interact with certain medicines in ways that reduce their effectiveness, or increase the risk of side-effects,' warned Dipa Kamda, writing for &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/coffee-can-interfere-with-your-medication-heres-what-you-need-to-know-256919"&gt;The Conversation.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From common cold tablets to antidepressants, caffeine's impact on the body goes far beyond a quick energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coffee may be part of your daily routine, but it’s also a potent chemical compound that can influence how your body processes medicine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine is a stimulant that speeds up activity in your brain and nervous system, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A pharmacist has warned that drinking coffee is dangerous for thousands of people on common medications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular cold and flu medicines, like Sudafed, contain a decongestant called pseudoephedrine, which also has stimulant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you combine this with the caffeine in coffee, the effects can be amplified, causing jitters, restlessness, headaches, fast heart rate and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining caffeine with pseudoephedrine can also raise blood sugar and body temperature, particularly important for people with diabetes, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/coffee-can-interfere-with-your-medication-heres-what-you-need-to-know-256919"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With many cold medications already containing added caffeine, drinking coffee can increase the risks further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk also applies to those taking stimulant medications to treat ADHD, like amphetamines, or asthma drugs such as theophylline, which has stimulant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist warned: 'Using them together may increase the risk of side-effects such as a rapid heartbeat and sleep disruption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also added caffeine in some branded over-the-counter painkillers, such as those containing paracetamol or aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking coffee can speed up how quickly the drugs are absorbed and while this helps them work faster, it can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant found in dozens of cold and flu medicines on the shelves &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It could raise the risk of side effects like stomach irritation, or bleeding,' said Ms Kamda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Although] no serious cases have been reported, caution is still advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking coffee while taking some types of medicines to control irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or blood pressure is known to make them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Ms Kamda added those with heart conditions don't have to stop drinking coffee entirely, but may want to 'consider limiting intake or switching to decaf'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you drink coffee immediately before or after taking thyroid medication like levothyroxine, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt; absorption of the drug can fall by up to 50 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain and constipation, to return 'even if you’re taking your medicine correctly,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is recommended those taking the medication should wait 30 to 60 minutes before eating or drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this is most common with tablet forms of levothyroxine, and less likely with liquid forms, Ms Kamda pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This timing rule also applies to a class of medications used to treat osteoporosis and other bone conditions called bisphosphonates, including alendronate and risedronate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also make the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant, selective serotonin inhibitors, for example sertraline and citalopram, less effective, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703"&gt;lab studies have found.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And drinking coffee with the older and less commonly used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such amitriptyline or imipramine, can tirgger side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist, with 17 years experience, explained: 'TCAs are broken down by the liver enzyme CYP1A2, which also metabolises caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The competition between the two can slow drug breakdown, increasing side-effects, or delay caffeine clearance, making you feel jittery or wired longer than usual.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problematic ingredient in coffee, caffeine, can also be found in a cup of tea, a can of Coca Cola, and even in green tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist added: 'Everyone metabolises caffeine differently. Some people feel fine after three cups, while others get side-effects after just one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pay attention to how your body responds and talk to your pharmacist or GP if anything feels off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you’re ever unsure whether your medicine and your coffee are a good match, ask your pharmacist or doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A short conversation might save you weeks of side-effects or reduced treatment effectiveness, and help you enjoy your brew with peace of mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Open your eyes, reach for coffee and sip. That warm first gulp seems to shift your brain into gear. But what if it also helps you stay sharp and strong as you age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what new research suggests. Scientists followed almost 50,000 women for 30 years. They found something unexpected. Women who drank regular coffee during midlife were more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; well – physically, mentally, and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drinking-coffee-linked-to-healthy-aging"&gt;Drinking coffee linked to healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on women aged 45 to 60. Researchers measured their caffeine intake and followed their health over the next three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to know who would reach age 70 without serious disease, memory problems, depression, or physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end, 3,706 women met those goals. Most of them drank about 315 milligrams of caffeine per day. That’s roughly three small cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea, soda, and decaffeinated coffee didn’t show the same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-biological-age-may-predict-dementia-risk-better-than-birth-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. But with each extra cup of regular coffee, chances of healthy aging rose by 2 to 5 percent. The benefit topped out around five small cups a day – or 2.5 modern-sized mugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” said Dr. Sara Mahdavi, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi is also an adjunct professor at &lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nutritional Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee – not tea or decaf – may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function,” said Dr. Mahdav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-coffee-helps-you-age-well"&gt;Not all coffee helps you age well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why coffee and not tea? Researchers aren’t sure yet. Coffee contains hundreds of compounds besides caffeine. Some of those might protect the brain, muscles, or metabolism. Or maybe it’s just the amount of caffeine people get from coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a twist. Another study led by Dr. Mahdavi looked at how coffee affects the kidneys. This time, the answer depended on your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this second study, researchers tracked over 600 young adults in Italy. Everyone had early signs of high blood pressure. None were on medication. The scientists also looked at a gene called CYP1A2. This gene controls how fast your body breaks down caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-decide-if-coffee-helps-or-harms"&gt;Genes decide if coffee helps or harms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people break down caffeine quickly. They have the AA version of the CYP1A2 gene. Others process it slowly – they have the AC or CC versions. This second group makes up nearly half the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For slow metabolizers, coffee came with risks. Heavy coffee drinkers in this group – those drinking over three cups a day – had a much higher chance of developing kidney problems as they &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow metabolizers were 2.7 times more likely to develop protein in their urine. Their risk of kidney hyperfiltration doubled. The chance of developing high blood pressure went up 2.8 times. Fast metabolizers? No extra risk. They seemed to tolerate coffee just fine, even at higher amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the present cohort study, caffeinated coffee intake was associated with increases in the risks of albuminuria, hyperfiltration, and hypertension only among slow metabolizers of caffeine, suggesting that caffeine may play a role in the development of kidney disease in susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Mahdav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-habits-shape-long-term-health"&gt;Habits shape long-term health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this does not mean you should quit coffee. The risks apply mainly to people who metabolize caffeine slowly and drink large amounts. For most people, two cups a day should be safe – and possibly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” said Dr. Mahdavi. “Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, coffee is not a magic drink. It helps a little. Healthy habits matter more. Still, it’s good news if you already enjoy your daily brew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-personalized-diet"&gt;Building a personalized diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi will present her findings at &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando. Her team now plans to study how the chemicals in coffee interact with genes and aging pathways. The goal is to understand who benefits most and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, your genes might help build a personalized diet. One that supports your brain, protects your kidneys, and keeps you moving as you age. Coffee might be part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you take that first sip of coffee in the morning, pause for a moment. That warm, familiar drink may be doing more than simply helping you shake off sleep or sharpen your focus for the day ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-coffee-might-help-you-age-better"&gt;Daily coffee might help you age better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to growing research, especially if it is caffeinated coffee, your daily cup might be quietly contributing to a healthier, stronger version of yourself in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start seeing coffee as a miracle cure, take a step back. Coffee can support well-being, but it is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. If you want to age well – staying active, mentally sharp, and free from chronic illness – then coffee alone won’t carry you there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to move your body regularly and need to eat meals that nourish, not just fill. You also need to understand how your body responds to substances like caffeine, because your genes play a role in how well coffee works for you – or whether it causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging doesn’t come from a single habit, drink, or moment. It’s the result of years of daily decisions that seem small at the time. Over the decades, those small decisions build something powerful. Coffee can be one of them, but it is not the only one. Keep choosing well, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog is based on research presented at NUTRITION 2025 and a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:18:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNNjFrUl9YNVlZcnVwNDBVQ3dRQVlqS05WWDFNcm94RkFrSGZzbUxWbnlad3RNQ2N4RXdiLUtHa1dKMmo2VkxIejR0UXdaY3lqZDE2dG43N0hZTHZEa0h0angza2dYbDJkRy1QcWtQNGhHaWs4bE8wM21PM3FIemJFVTFoVzRObVJ3Unh6TWxXT3lKb3ZRd2Jv</guid></item><item><title>我们终于可以摆脱世界上的蚊子了。但是我们应该吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | We finally may be able to rid the world of mosquitoes.

Forget about tigers or bears — it’s the tiny mosquito that is the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/01/mosquito-days-malaria-texas-florida/"&gt;deadliest animal on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTIP26D6ONH7RGHVJPT5TGPWXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The human misery caused by malaria is undeniable. Nearly 600,000 people died of the disease in 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, with the majority of cases in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GR7L2UKI6RAPXLLZAN3AASHHTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the continent, the death toll is akin to “crashing two Boeing 747s into Kilimanjaro” every day, said Paul Ndebele, a bioethicist at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYPLD6XTRZF4JBP5JDU5F4BKNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For gene-drive advocates, making the case for releasing genetically modified mosquitoes in nations such as Burkina Faso or Uganda is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SLWJKLP4GZD7PP7ZMLIHN5NZM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is not a difficult audience because these are people that are living in an area where children are dying,” said Krystal Birungi, an entomologist for Target Malaria in Uganda, though she added that she sometimes has to fight misinformation, such as the false idea that bites from genetically modified mosquitoes can make people sterile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XZQBMRIENGB3LXAZLQP7CLGKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But recently, the Hastings Center for Bioethics, a research institute in New York, and Arizona State University brought together a group of bioethicists to discuss the potential pitfalls of intentionally trying to drive a species to extinction. In &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv4045"&gt;a policy paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Science last month, the group concluded that “deliberate full extinction might occasionally be acceptable, but only extremely rarely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ZZAHQA3TNEEBIG4MIJBH2W5PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A compelling candidate for total eradication, according to the bioethicists, is the New World screwworm. This parasitic fly, which lays eggs in wounds and eats the flesh of both humans and livestock, appears to play little role in ecosystems. Infections are difficult to treat and can lead to slow and painful deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DV4AKTIUPVCVPKK5QGGIZ7HYFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet it may be too risky, they say, to use gene drives on invasive rodents on remote Pacific islands where they decimate native birds, given the nonzero chance of a gene-edited rat or mouse jumping ship to the mainland and spreading across a continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YC5UA7CK25EVDEEYEOO6KS5QZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even at a microbial level, it became plain in our conversations, we are not in favor of remaking the world to suit human desires,” said Gregory Kaebnick, a senior research scholar at the institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z6I6JGNV4FD27DHGTL6S6D4SBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear how important malaria-carrying mosquitos&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are to broader ecosystems.

I pulled out a pair of pajama pants, and the pocket was greasy with two ruptured softgels of cod-liver oil I’d forgotten to remove. The whole load reeked like a cast-iron skillet of seared salmon. I was furious I could be so stupid and careless.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrq600173b776nkt9al3@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;I’d taken my lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, the generic version of Vyvanse, that morning, just as I had almost every day since I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/paris-hilton-adhd-music-video.html"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; a month earlier at age 35. The first time I swallowed the yellow capsule, I proceeded to paint my home office in two coats of White Dove, the result of a euphoric burst of energy that felt entirely new to me. The morning of the fish-pill incident, though, I felt so tired that I took a nap. I did not feel at all like I’d ingested a stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrrs00183b77tfnx6p9x@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;I blamed myself for my low energy and lack of focus. Maybe I hadn’t slept well or eaten enough protein — or something? But a month later, I was again overwhelmed with fatigue, paralyzed by small tasks, and hating myself. And again the month after that. I realized my meds seemed to stop working right before &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/menstruation-full-moon-red-moon-cycle-white-moon-cycle.html"&gt;my period began&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrtn00193b779hs8h0kk@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Hormonal fluctuations in ADHD symptoms aren’t rare (on Reddit, a cadre of women commiserate over taking high doses of stimulant drugs that seem to work no better than sugar pills), but the scientific community has been slow to recognize them. One study found ADHD diagnoses in women ages 23 to 49 nearly doubled between 2020 and 2022, and another found a 14 percent increase in stimulant prescriptions for women and girls 5 to 64 between 2020 and 2021. That uptick has likely prompted more complaints about period-related dips in drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrva001a3b77nmieyfbh@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;Although just a handful of researchers are investigating the trend, a theory surrounding it has emerged: When estrogen is high, dopamine (the mood-regulating brain chemical that ADHD meds like Ritalin and Concerta boost) is also high, says &lt;a href="https://www.drellenlittman.com/"&gt;Dr. Ellen Littman,&lt;/a&gt; a psychologist who has worked with high-IQ women and girls with ADHD for more than 35 years. People with ADHD have dysregulated dopamine functioning, so when their estrogen level drops (typically, right before the menstrual bleed begins), they feel the loss of its compensatory effect on their dopamine levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrxb001b3b77dx8ua98x@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;“This is what we clinically see,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eunetworkadultadhd.com/author/sandra-kooij/"&gt;Sandra Kooij&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist working in the Netherlands and the founder and chair of the European Network Adult ADHD. She says doctors can’t measure dopamine, but they can measure estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs00001c3b77jzdoksej@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Formal research on women’s hormones and ADHD is scarce. The current theory largely builds on a 2017 study that followed 32 women with regular periods and found ADHD symptoms worsened when their estrogen levels were low. But the vast majority of ADHD research is male-centric.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs24001d3b77kmm2f4ot@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;This has led to a care crisis for women. Within the medical community, there’s no consensus about who should treat a female ADHD patient with symptoms that present differently depending on where she is in her cycle. These women tell me they often bounce among gynecologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists and are sometimes given additional diagnoses, like anxiety, depression, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In 2021, Kooij and her collaborators published a study suggesting that women with ADHD experienced more frequent and severe hormone-related mood disorders compared with the general population. “I had to consider, &lt;em&gt;Why is this happening?&lt;/em&gt;” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs8y001e3b77bkhsh89n@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;Carmen, a 38-year-old mother of three in Michigan, realized her period seemed to be rendering her 40-mg. of Vyvanse ineffective after she saw a TikTok that described her symptoms. She had previously attributed her lack of concentration, short fuse, and exhaustion to her multiple sclerosis and PMS. Carmen’s primary-care doctor has suggested she take a stimulant booster dose on the days she needs it but also  cautioned that there’s not much research to back that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Every month, she tells me, she turns into “an idiot,” becoming extra forgetful and hot-tempered. “Three kids asking me different things at the same time,” she says. “I can handle it on other days that I feel more clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjscj001g3b771j0h3jwa@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;In a 2023 study building on her earlier work, Kooij and colleagues found that increasing the dosage of ADHD meds the week before menstruation improved inattention, irritability, and energy levels for all nine of their research participants. It was a small sample size, but it furthered Kooij’s hypothesis that clinicians could improve women’s symptoms if they treated both their hormonal and their neurological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjsex001h3b77agow9lap@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;“It’s important for the treating physician to look at the individual’s needs,” says &lt;a href="https://learningcenter.unc.edu/services/ldadhd-services/burnett-seminars/dr-patricia-quinn/"&gt;Dr. Patricia Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, a retired developmental pediatrician who co-founded the National Center for Girls and Women with ADHD. Some struggle with focus and energy for two weeks before their period, while others notice the problem only for a few days, and still others struggle the entire time they are bleeding. In her practice, she adjusted her patients’ stimulant doses and regulated their hormones with birth control.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of recognizing that their worsening ADHD symptoms may connect to cyclical hormonal changes, women might blame themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes-fleming-83b277225"&gt;Jes Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, a holistic PMDD specialist, says many of her clients are riddled with shame and guilt, which transform into “negative self-talk, low self-esteem, self-harming behaviors, and suicidal ideation.”&lt;/p&gt;

Months later, she realized her period was affecting her meds. When I call her, she is in the middle of a premenstrual stretch and doesn’t feel like her Adderall is working. She’s also preparing for a trip to her native St. Thomas. “I’m really trying to regulate my mind and body, but my medication isn’t helping the way I need it to right now,” she says. “It sucks because I travel Monday and have so much to do before then.” She also says she’s very sensitive right now, taking everything personally. People aren’t responding to her messages. She just had her room tidied by a professional cleaner, and now, a week later, it’s a disaster again. Aniska says she’s not really upset about the mess. She’s upset with herself for being unable to maintain order.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjsnn001k3b77msqi98vd@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;Self-criticism is common in women with ADHD, and it can escalate into crippling fear and chronic worry. Anyone can launder fish-oil pills, but I constantly make errors — forget I’m doing laundry, create DOOM piles (“didn’t organize, only moved”), abandon side hustles. Those missteps erode my confidence and mutate into intrusive, depressive thinking that stop me from being functional. One of my biggest problems is a fear of my husband dying. Once a month, this passing thought overwhelms me and I play out his death in detail, imagining the make of the car that will hit him, whom I’ll call first. It’s anxiety, sure. But here’s the thing: When my meds work, I don’t ponder his demise. I just think about what’s for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjspo001l3b77nu7xbese@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;To add to the chaos, there’s still&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/adderall-shortage-adhd-medication-ascent-pharmaceuticals.html"&gt; a stimulant shortage&lt;/a&gt;, so every month I have to ask my doctor to resend my prescription to multiple pharmacies until we find one that has a 30-day supply of 20-mg. pills. Given this ongoing challenge, I haven’t broached adjusting the dose to match my hormonal dips — or explored whether my health insurance would cover this kind of variation. Plus when I told my doctor that my meds felt less effective around my period, she was a little curious but didn’t have much to say. Hormones, she told me, don’t factor into how she manages treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

But why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They don’t have an “envelope” (an outer layer of lipids/fats that many viruses have). This outer layer can be disrupted by alcohol, which causes them not to work, Tetro explained. But when viruses are non-enveloped, the alcohol has a harder time getting into the virus, and “it gets repelled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For bacteria, certain types “can form spores, which protect [them] in harsh environments,” Leung added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of spores like a tank, Tetro said. The inside of the bacterium is protected by this strong material on the outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Alcohol may do some damage, but simply will not break through all the layers,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Clostridium difficile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (which causes the colon to be infected and severe diarrhea) is an example of this kind of bacterium that can survive against hand sanitizer, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, some parasites that have a “tough outer shell” are also resistant to alcohol, Leung said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cryptosporidium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cryptosporidium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is the leading cause of waterborne illness in the U.S., has a cell wall-like a “bomb shelter” that “fully protects the inside structure,” Tetro explained. Using alcohol “would be like throwing a ping pong ball at it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when should you opt for hand-washing instead of using hand sanitizer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-washing is always preferred when possible, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/soniya-gandhi-2426360.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Soniya Gandhi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/soniya-gandhi-2426360.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Soniya Gandhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate chief medical officer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. But it’s important to use “proper technique” for it to actually work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Lather [and] scrub [your] hands to create friction … [Scrub] for at least 20 seconds,” Gandhi advised. “Dry [your] hands thoroughly after washing well because wet hands can more easily transmit germs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you don’t have access to soap and water, using hand sanitizer is the next best option, she said. Here’s how to use it properly to maximize effectiveness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol. “These higher concentration sanitizers are more effective at killing germs than those with lower alcohol concentrations,” Gandhi explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squeeze the appropriate amount of sanitizer on your hands. “Use enough … to keep the hands wet for 15-20 seconds while you’re rubbing,” Tetro said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thoroughly rub it into both of your hands. “Not just [on] the palms but [also] in-between the fingers,” Leung added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not wipe off the sanitizer. Let it dry on your hands, Gandhi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just remember that hand sanitizer doesn’t work against all germs. Leung especially recommends washing your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, before eating and preparing food, after handling garbage, and after coughing or sneezing into your hands. Also, handrubs aren’t effective at removing harmful chemicals or when your hands are visibly dirty or greasy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget about these other simple ways to avoid sickness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These tips can provide an added layer of protection from getting infected by germs, including those that are alcohol-resistant:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your hands aren’t clean, avoid touching your face. “Surfaces such as [your] eyes and mouth have mucous membranes and easily serve as port[s] of entry” for germs, Leung said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, like door handles and light switches, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Specifically, colon cancer occurred at a rate of 3.5 out of 100,000 in men in Uganda compared to 51.8 out of 100,000 in men in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think that’s the first time that it was really noticed that this was a prevention for colon cancer,” noted Quinton. Meaning, it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important to prioritize your fiber consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways that fiber benefits colon health and even more ways to reach the daily recommended amount. Here’s what experts say: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating enough fiber helps move your stool through your digestive tract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber plays an important role in the health of the colon, and when the colon gets unhealthy, then we’re set up for development of cancer and other inflammatory diseases,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, fiber adds bulk to the stool, which helps with proper colon function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Fiber] makes the stools more easy to move along, so the time that the stool spends in the colon is lessened, so less chance for constipation, more normal stools,” explained Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also good for the removal of toxins: “If there are any toxins in the stool that lead to cancer, they spend less time in the colon, and therefore lessen the chances of cancer exposure or other diseases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber also benefits the microbiome, which is protective against colon cancer, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is also important for the microbiome, which has been the main focus of research in the past decade, said &lt;a href="https://umaine.edu/foodandagriculture/people/mary-ellen-camire/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mary Ellen Camire" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://umaine.edu/foodandagriculture/people/mary-ellen-camire/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Mary Ellen Camire&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is often prebiotic, meaning it’s food for probiotic bacteria, Camire added. And probiotics help &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14598-probiotics" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="rebuild and balance" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14598-probiotics" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;rebuild and balance&lt;/a&gt; your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the bacteria get a nice fiber meal, they are very active, and they make compounds that help protect the colon” against colon cancer, along with other kinds of cancers, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, the cells that line the colon, which are called colonocytes, get their energy from the microbiome, added Quinton. “And when the colonocytes are healthy, then they form an intact barrier along the colon, so that substances that may cause disease or cancer can’t cross that barrier,” Quinton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also helps the colon produce mucus [and] thick mucus lining also protects the colon, so without enough fiber, our microbiome gets diseased and they don’t produce the energy or nutrients that our colon needs to stay healthy,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: fcafotodigital via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;fcafotodigital via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Beans and legumes are a high-fiber meal.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can eat more fiber:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is a really critical part of our overall diet, and the typical American only gets 5 or 10% of the recommended amount of fiber in their diet on any given day,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, women need about 25 grams of fiber each day and men need about 38 grams, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and legumes are very high in fiber and certain fruits and veggies are, too. Lentils have 18 grams of fiber per cup, black beans have about 15 grams in 1 can, chia seeds have 10 grams in 2 tablespoons, barley has 6 grams in 1 cup, raspberries have 8 grams in 1 cup and a pear has 6 grams, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, you could make a bean and whole wheat pasta salad to up your fiber intake, or make some cold barley salads, said Camire. You can also lean into seasonal produce, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camire added that it’s important to spread your fiber intake out across the day and to consume different kinds of foods for fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mistake a lot of people make when they decide ‘I’m going to make fiber a priority’ is they don’t give their system time to adjust. If you’re used to eating 15 grams of fiber a day, and you start eating 30 grams a day, the bacteria think they’re having a party and so you may have some gas and cramping,” Camire said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should start out gradually and slowly build up, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you find the foods that you tolerate well and that you like, getting enough fiber won’t be difficult or expensive,” Camire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And fiber supplements don’t cut it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to turn to fiber supplements as a quick and easy way to reach your fiber goal, but experts say you shouldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of the supplements ... are an adequate replacement for natural fiber,” Quinton said. Also, since you need so much fiber, fiber supplements end up being just a drop in the bucket, Camire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the supplements can increase your stool bulk and help constipation, “they don’t necessarily have the soluble fiber elements that feed the microbiome and keep it healthy, which keeps your gut healthy,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think you can just replace the fiber with supplements. You need to be eating whole food,” Quinton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond fiber intake, there’s more you can do to lower your colon cancer risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to also take other preventative steps to lower your risk of developing colon cancer. These include monitoring yourself for concerning symptoms such as ongoing stomach pain, blood in your stool or a change in your bowel movements. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to let your doctor know if colon cancer runs in your family as you may be eligible for an &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colonoscopy-before-45-signs_l_65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="early colonoscopy screening" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;early colonoscopy screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman has urged others to beware of the dangers of innocent-looking blemishes, after a 'single dot' on her chest turned out to be deadly melanoma skin &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-e6fb6030-405f-11f0-af30-83ad5196704d"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leah Alexis Adams,

skipped sunscreen, but thought the disease could 'never touch' her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet what she believed to be a freckle turned out to be one of the fastest-spreading cancers, resulting in the removal of large chunks of her chest and armpit when she was just 26 years-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKXRlEzADJL/"&gt;a recent video&lt;/a&gt; posted on her Instagram page, she shared the unsuspecting mole with her 11,000 followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Turns out, melanoma doesn’t care how good you think you look—it just shows up and tries to wreck your life,' she said in another clip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So yeah…learn from my mistakes, not your biopsy results.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/melanoma-skin-cancer#melanoma_stats0"&gt;17,500 new &lt;/a&gt;melanoma skin cancer cases are diagnosed in the UK every year, with some 2,300 are killed by the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;it is estimated &lt;/a&gt;that new diagnoses reach over 100,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At the appointment, a mole on her chest was removed and biopsied, and she was later diagnosed with melanoma that was stage 1A bordering on 1B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until Ms Adams' father Gary was diagnosed with early stage melanoma in 2019, that she decided to undergo a random mole check with a dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor flagged the unsuspecting-looking mole on her chest and removed it for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctors stand close to you, scanning you from head to toe, asking questions about your history of sun exposure, family skin cancer history, etc,'&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ihadcancer.com/leah-adams-my-stage-1a-melanoma-journey"&gt; she previously told&lt;/a&gt; a cancer support community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The questions about tanning beds and sunscreen came, and I told them exactly what they didn’t want to hear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn’t wear sunscreen, I used tanning beds often, my dad and my grandfather had skin cancer.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results of a biopsy revealed the devastating truth—Ms Adams had melanoma that was bordering on stage 1B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike stage 1A, this means the lesion is ulcerated, leaving an open wound. Experts say melanoma at this stage are far more likely to spread to other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weeks later she underwent surgery to remove the growth, as well as healthy tissue beside her breasts and several glands under her armpit, to check for spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of melanoma cancer have increased from 2004-2006 to 2014-2016, according to the most recent figures available, to 26 cases per 100,000, compared to 17 cases per 100,000 in 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was not fully prepared for the extensive amount of time this surgery would take,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My surgery was an all-day process with prep, surgery, and recovery. I was put under full anesthesia with stitches in my chest and glue stitches under my arm. After the surgery, I was in a lot of pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two weeks later she got the good news that doctors hadn't found cancer in her lymph nodes, meaning it hadn't spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has to undergo skin checks every three to four months and urged others to undergo the vital test at least once a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this means any sign of spread will be caught early, it means moles are 'constantly' being cut out of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m barely thirty and have scars all over my body,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reflecting on her diagnosis she said: 'Did I give myself cancer from not protecting my skin and not taking care of my health enough? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I didn’t do that skin check, that mole could have grown into something life-threatening. I might not be here today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I've turned that pain into advocacy, education, and a deep passion for sun safety and skin health,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Adams' tale comes as cases of melanoma skin have been subject to an alarming rise in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data released last year revealed diagnoses have increased by almost a third in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older age groups have had the highest rises in sun-linked skin cancer rates, with a 57 per cent increase in those over the age of 80 in the decade to 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main warning sign of melanoma skin cancer is a new mole or a change in an existing mole anywhere on your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most common areas are often those exposed to the sun, but in rarer cases it can affect the eyes, soles of the feet, and palms of hands or genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says to look out for moles with an uneven shape or edges, a mix of colours, large in size and that change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:55:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNbDhERmdsTjBvcXhHNGZBVU94RE42UzFycUx3YmRHa0NPVFBCLVo4YjQxN201ekRJRHM1RGNrRGtMMV81N0xEYy15dS01UDh6aFNPUDYtUXpoVDZVNDkzckpjbFNiZmhadVZmX3N2ZS1jaXo4N3lUeWhQYjROZ2xqam9iSF95aGp3U3lVNlBmZ0hmNXpSeGdJU0h2Y3h5UkY3ZVHSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZEUzNCUTNqdjdwbm9mWFZzbk5PRGJ0aVYzS3hGeE1vOTFuUmJRWnFGc1FmV3U5UWlQRHExam1SSnhTcno3aV84cWN6dDRUM01rMm1qalV0N1FQRjRmZjFITE1ZQ3J6d3JoTWNhcnRsN0U5VzQxdFNMaG9nY041Uk1PQUN1RjcyQXJISEozU09OSGprX21COVNiRGxFa1laRmVuVVBmUkk</guid></item><item><title>老年人使用大麻达到新高：研究- Axios | Seniors' marijuana use reaches new high: study -

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the tactile nature of humans and our fondness for stroking and fondling our pets, when we live with animals, microbes from their fur and paws &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23599893/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to end up on our skin – at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This has led to suggestions that the "microbiome" could be colonised by bugs from our pets. This is the collection of vast colonies of microbes that live on our skin, in our mouths and most notably in the gut, which hosts a significant concentration of our body's immune cells. According to Nasia Safdar, an infectious disease professor at the University of Wisconsin in the US, this concept has attracted interest from the pet food industry. The idea would be to develop products marketed as promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in cats and dogs, which might then be transferred to their owners, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That angle has been an attractive one for people to fund, because for most of us, it's the human condition that we're interested in," says Safdar. "So what role can the animal play in that?" she asks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Safdar says she is considering running a study which would involve collecting faecal samples from both pets and their human owners when they come for repeated veterinary appointments to see if their guts become more microbially similar with time. She also wants to see if she can identify similar bacterial species which could confer health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images It’s thought that our ancestors lived in close contact with animals, and this may be necessary for developing a healthy immune system (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;It’s thought that our ancestors lived in close contact with animals, and this may be necessary for developing a healthy immune system (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, others feel that the idea of dog or cat or any other kind of non-human animal microbes being incorporated into our microbiomes is dubious. "There's zero evidence of that whatsoever," says Gilbert. "We don't really find long-term accumulation of dog bacteria on our skin, in our mouth, or in our guts. They don't really stick around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In response to this, Safdar says that she still feels the study is very much worthwhile, stating she feels it is plausible that gut microbes can be transferred from pets to their owners and vice versa. "It's worth studying and hasn't been closely looked at yet," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gilbert believes that pets are playing a different, yet equally vital role. His theory is that because our distant ancestors domesticated various species, our immune systems have evolved to be stimulated by the microbes that they carry. These microbes do not reside with us permanently, but our immune cells recognise the familiar signals as they pass through, which then keeps the immune system developing in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Over many millennia, the human immune system got used to seeing dog, horse and cow bacteria," says Gilbert. "And so when it sees those things, it triggers beneficial immune development. It knows what to do," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7058978/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Studies have also shown&lt;/a&gt; that humans who live in the same household as a pet end up with gut microbiomes which are more like each other, and Gilbert suggests that the animal is likely acting as a vehicle to help transfer human microbes between its owners. At the same time, regular exposure to the pet's own microbes will also be stimulating their immune systems to stay more active and better manage the bacterial populations in their own gut and skin microbiomes, keeping pathogens out and stimulating the growth of useful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="ancient-microbes" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="ancient-microbes" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Ancient microbes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is all good news for animal lovers, with research continuing to suggest that living with pets across our life course can be good for our immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After reading the study on the Amish and the Hutterites, Shanahan was inspired to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0963-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;conduct his own research&lt;/a&gt; on Irish travellers, a marginalised population who typically live in confined spaces amongst multiple animals – from dogs and cats to ferrets and horses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Shanahan sequenced their gut microbiomes and compared them with Irish people living more modern lifestyles today, as well as microbiomes sequenced from indigenous populations in Fiji, Madagascar, Mongolia, Peru and Tanzania who still live a lifestyle akin to our hunter-gatherer ancestors.

Researchers at the University of Arizona in the US &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2015-03-friend-medicine.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have explored&lt;/a&gt; whether rehoming unwanted dogs with older adults could help to improve their physical and mental health by boosting their immune systems. And results from an Italian research group which created an educational farm where children from homes with no pets could regularly pet horses under supervision &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424002283" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the children's gut microbiomes started to produce more beneficial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gilbert says it's plausible that this could be a means of improving childhood immunity. "If you're exposed to more types of bacteria, you are going to stimulate your immune system in more variable ways, which may then improve its ability to manage the microbes on your skin and in your gut," he says.

For example, having a dog makes you more likely to go for regular walks, notes Liam O'Mahoney, professor of immunology at APC Microbiome Ireland, a microbiome-dedicated research centre at University College Cork. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you have a pet, you get out and about in the environment and go for walks in the park," says O'Mahoney.

Researchers followed up on the participants for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients who regularly ate foods that promote inflammation in the body — ultraprocessed foods, excessive amounts of sugar and saturated fats — had up to an 87% higher risk of dying from their disease when compared to people who ate a far less inflammatory diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-eating-reach-70-no-chronic-disease-study-rcna197811" target="_blank"&gt;less-inflammatory diet was more plant-focused&lt;/a&gt;, and included foods such as leafy greens, carrots, coffee and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fa1" class="body-heading"&gt;Real-world examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer centers have dietitians who work with patients to make sure they’re getting proper nutrition while they’re going through treatment, said Heather Greenlee, medical director of integrative medicine at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Chemotherapy, for example, can come with side effects, including difficulty swallowing and poor appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Once treatment is done, patients may need additional help making dietary changes to improve survival long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The issue that a lot of patients face is that people don’t know how to make these dietary changes that are sustainable over time,” said Greenlee, who also wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Greenlee heads Fred Hutch’s &lt;a href="https://www.cookforyourlife.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Cook for Your Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;program for people who’ve had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really important for big studies like this to be done to show that there is this potential benefit for lifestyle and behavioral changes in the face of some of these cancers that are difficult to treat,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She recommends a plant-focused approach, such as adding beans, broccoli and cauliflower to meals, as well as high-fiber foods. “Those are all good places to start,” Greenlee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c8be2f" class="body-heading"&gt;Exercise boost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients also boosted their chances of living longer with physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who ate diets least likely to promote inflammation and who did the equivalent of taking a brisk walk for an hour at least three times a week had a 63% lower risk of death from any cause during the five-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/exercise-may-benefit-colon-cancer-patients-much-drugs-rcna209560" target="_blank"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt;, also presented Sunday at the cancer meeting, found that regular exercise was linked to a 28% lower risk of the cancer recurring, a new cancer diagnosis or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#" target="_blank"&gt;150,000 people are diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with colorectal cancer every year, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Not only can healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise, have an impact after a cancer diagnosis,” said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, “they are absolutely as good as the benefits we see from drugs, and probably even better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQZ3I0RGI3Z3J0ZHV0UE43WTFibHB2Vkc4VXpBNU9wWkl6NksweF9kdzd0SHVueVRjSkpYRzJJeFcybHNMaU96NW1tOWZSZ00xbW91aTg3WFZ5RmlNa3l1ZmNtWEQ3SU0wZnl2YXRXUWJjRjVoaFhlSVk0RUZXVlBMVy00NHFsc0R1Yk9ZM01QRDBvelpCTjVQUHZrcGNHaUxJMjhrVHlMM2ViaUpaQjExY2NxOTNaYWRObGN1QTBKNXM5UdIBVkFVX3lxTE1MeW5KS2pvOWRuVmoyRDdQQVZzV0IxVDVpVzd1cFJRX1Z6T2tUdDdhRndKUms0cUJnTnRXZGFkNkg4dkxEM2poOFFrZ0RlSnNWOWhzdW1n</guid></item><item><title>6岁男孩患有危及生命的中风，导致瘫痪： “罕见并发症” -福克斯新闻 | Boy, 6, suffers life-threatening stroke that causes paralysis: 'Rare complication' - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQQktlaDlQdlJSVVowMFV6ZnBnRXNxOGdmdWdwWHcwakpjTlVaSVBFclU0ZzdwSFlLdmRDQjA5cnNya2QyRnZiX0NsNDRrOHZ2Q1prMEk4bGZvamhXUEJCRlVwUUlrMGdmVVR1UXFMRW4ydjctZUFBM085YlVGemVfRHVtTjF2VW96NExFSWpxWUh4Wm9MMzVDeUNRc04yRXFrU0Fn0gGoAUFVX3lxTFBUZlBpN19pN09adXU0akRHZkdfMVM5b2lVYk9XeVlXNUNRY3BDclc3ei1ROVVQZWJVZzNqVl9wOHFMbDFIS3l2dWhuTGZIUXFQNWsyczQyeWZGa2hXTlBWZUh6c0hPdVN5T1VOdmlETGt0YW80NmMtVEdZUmZ6TFJDWE80dUVRbjAzV3BGa1RwejFzNURkbTdUMi0ySks4cFFlUi1xTFJmYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;div class="contain" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;   &lt;div class="info" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;p data-v-5f342d4c&gt;Preston Patton was just 6 years old when he suffered a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Christmas Eve is usually an evening of fun and festivity — but for one Illinois family in 2023, it came with a life-threatening medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;After enjoying a few &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;holiday traditions&lt;/a&gt;, the Patton family had just gotten settled at the dinner table when Preston Patton, who was 6 years old at the time, suddenly slid onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He just fell off the chair and was limp," recalled Shawn Patton, Preston’s father, according to a press release from OSF HealthCare. "I didn’t think it &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was a stroke&lt;/a&gt;, but I just knew something was wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/mini-strokes-may-cause-surprising-long-term-health-issue-experts-warn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patton immediately called 911 and first responders rushed his son to OSF HealthCare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, a team of emergency and pediatric doctors assessed the situation. A brain scan revealed that Preston had a blood clot in his brain, and his &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart function&lt;/a&gt; had dropped to just 10%. &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of this article.) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shawn Patton is pictured with his young son, Preston, who experienced a life-threatening stroke at 6 years old.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(OSF HealthCare)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), this condition is rare in children, generally affecting only around one or two in every 100,000 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;kids and teens&lt;/a&gt;, statistics show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had complete paralysis on the left side of his body," said Sourabh Lahoti, M.D., a vascular and interventional neurologist with OSF HealthCare Illinois Neurological Institute, in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stroke-dementia-depression-share-17-preventable-risk-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STROKE, DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION SHARE THESE 17 PREVENTABLE RISK FACTORS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No movement was possible, and the vision in his left &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;visual field&lt;/a&gt; was lost. He could not move his eyes to the left, either," added Lahoti, who led the boy's care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had the telltale signs of a stroke affecting the right side of his brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scan showed that the clot was blocking blood flow to the right side of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Preston’s brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"No movement was possible, and the vision in his left visual field was lost."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had to take that clot out. If we hadn’t, chances are he would have gone on to develop a very big stroke," Lahoti said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would have not only left him paralyzed potentially for the rest of his life, but it could have been life-threatening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A brain scan revealed that Preston Patton, pictured front right, had a blood clot in his brain, and his heart function had dropped to just 10%.

"We decided to take that risk and prevent a lifelong disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preston Patton, pictured here with his sister, is one of the few children in the world to undergo a life-saving thrombectomy, according to OSF HealthCare.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(OSF Healthcare)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the clot was removed, the doctors saw a "complete reversal" of Patton’s symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was "truly magical," Dr. Lahoti recalled in the release, particularly after the boy had arrived at the hospital in a state of complete paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the anesthesia was taken off, he woke up and was able to move his left arm and leg again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/friends-family-may-protect-heart-attack-stroke-diabetes-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRIENDS, FAMILY MAY PROTECT AGAINST HEART ATTACK, STROKE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES, STUDY SUGGESTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before thrombectomy therapy became available, patients didn’t have other options, the doctor noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The usual course was they were left with paralysis for life, and they were never able to live normally again," said Lahoti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors now believe that Preston’s stroke was caused by a "rare complication" from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/cold-and-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;flu infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the flu, there was a cross-reaction of the immunity his body built up," Lahoti said. "His immune system attacked the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/viruses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;flu virus&lt;/a&gt;, but also his kidneys and heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon after the clot was removed, the doctors saw a "complete reversal" of Patton’s symptoms.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(OSF Healthcare)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of that, his heart pumping got really weak, and we think that led to the formation of a clot in his heart. The clot then traveled from the heart to his brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston’s father noted that his late wife (mother of Preston and his sister, Carter), had died of a pulmonary embolism, which made the young boy’s medical emergency even more "emotionally challenging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks in the hospital, Preston is now doing well and is enjoying his favorite activities again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He goes to OT (occupational therapy) once a week and PT (physical therapy) once a month now," Shawn Patton said in an interview with OSF HealthCare.

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating your greens—and plenty of berries—could help sharpen your mind well into older age, new research shows. A large, long-term study found that even starting the so-called MIND diet later in life can significantly lower a person's risk of Alzheimer's and dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/mind-diet-mediterranean-dash-dementia-study-rcna209573"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports. Presented at the American Society for Nutrition's annual meeting, research led by University of Hawaii at Manoa and University of Southern California scientists found that middle-aged and older adults who followed the MIND diet—a combination of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, which aims to lower blood pressure—developed dementia at lower rates than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        Like the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet is rich in leafy greens, olive oil, and whole grains, but because of its focus on the brain, it gives special weight to foods like berries, which have been linked to brain health. Individual foods are scored based on type and frequency of consumption, with a higher overall score linked to a lower risk of dementia. For example, having two or more servings of berries per week scores higher than having one or none.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Researchers used data from the Multiethnic Cohort, which started in the early 1990s and followed adults from five racial/ethnic groups. At the start, participants who most closely adhered to the MIND diet had a 9% lower dementia risk, with an even greater reduction—13%—for Black, Latino, and white participants. Those who improved their MIND diet scores over a decade saw their risk drop by 25% compared to those who adhered less strictly to it over the years—even if they had not originally adhered to the diet closely, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mind-diet-brain-alzheimers-dementia-study/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; reports.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;center&gt;
                                        &lt;p id="divStoryContinues"&gt;story continues below&lt;/p&gt;
                                        
                                    &lt;/center&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The MIND diet's recommendations include six or more servings of leafy greens a week, daily servings of other vegetables, and limited intake of red meat, cheese, fried foods, pastries, and sweets. Experts emphasize variety in vegetables and note that while the study shows an association, it does not prove causation. Still, the findings align with a body of evidence that Mediterranean-style diets benefit overall brain and heart health. MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, while DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

I don't get why people are so scared of it,' a TikToker commented on Jana's video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clip was also shared on X, formerly Twitter, where one person said: 'Oil does a lot more for both flavour and the cooking process than simply preventing things from sticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I implore [someone] to do this with a pork chop or mushrooms and let me know how it tastes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really wish people would understand that some dose of oil is perfectly fine and healthy,' a third added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the influencer made it clear that she has nothing against oil and was simply sharing what she had learned. 'I love oil. But it's a fun hack. Don't worry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In reply to a comment about there being fewer calories with her hack, Jana also clarified that she still uses oil to cook and was not interested in maintaining a calorie deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was actually just a hack I wanted to try. I am still using oil, because it's healthy and we need it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using plant-based oils - such as olive, avocado, sunflower, canola, corn, and grapeseed - has been linked to better health outcomes, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 30-year study of more than 200,000 adults conducted by researchers at Harvard University found that people who cook with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473497/harvard-study-discovery-health-impact-seed-oils-rfk-jr.html"&gt;these types of oils instead of butter were less likely to die of any cause&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were 'surprised' to find swapping less than a tablespoon of butter for the same amount of oil lowered the overall risk of death by 17 percent, which the team called 'a pretty huge effect on health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested this could be because seed oils are lower than butter in saturated fat, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unlikely there would be any health benefit to using a cucumber instead of oil to cook, the mild-flavoured vegetable became a surprising favourite among TikTok users thanks to recipes shared by Canadian content creator Logan Moffitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Logan's &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13766579/cucumber-guy-bland-vegetable-viral-bizarre-recipes.html"&gt;recipes for sliced cucumbers went completely viral&lt;/a&gt; last year, sharing combinations such as soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, sugar and MSG, and salmon, cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 06:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQdWVHSmhfZk80VW82MHIyVVlDYVRPRl9vQmZ0SkplYU5tSW41RmpfTmJhdmkwbTJLc0hsODJEbzRPc2FIQ2ZfNzZ1bDB6MWRDc1FwQ196RFRzbWktYUZmMGY2MmhRN3ZBQ0Q0Ykg5Y29ZaVEwdEZoMkl3UFVGSWdWbWtXVVFoMWdzVTc1N2MteHR1Q1B5Z1ZrcWx5SDNDWVJaTi1ydWNSelRJc3NtQ0tZ0gG0AUFVX3lxTFAzV3k3UEpoOTQya2ZpRTNCbVo1dm5uMlpZS1F6WnZ5aUxHM0VpYUJtUTFCX2t5eG84bzgwNS01ZzlUSFFpdXlIRzhoaG0yX3FYejRXZGQxaktoQVR2Ulc1ZVVXWTVUbGMweVVvb1FaX1JRMTA3RlRlS2tZTG5UMHBfOVFQUUczNG1tc3dzSG53OFpINlJhRVJ3Qm9MaG5hckhvZ2FHXzdZWFZQYmREdzlYblV0dQ</guid></item><item><title>女人对她“从意大利祖母那里学到的”奇怪的煎蛋方法感到愤怒-每日邮报 | Woman causes outrage over bizarre method for frying an egg which she 'learnt from an Italian grandmother' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQdWVHSmhfZk80VW82MHIyVVlDYVRPRl9vQmZ0SkplYU5tSW41RmpfTmJhdmkwbTJLc0hsODJEbzRPc2FIQ2ZfNzZ1bDB6MWRDc1FwQ196RFRzbWktYUZmMGY2MmhRN3ZBQ0Q0Ykg5Y29ZaVEwdEZoMkl3UFVGSWdWbWtXVVFoMWdzVTc1N2MteHR1Q1B5Z1ZrcWx5SDNDWVJaTi1ydWNSelRJc3NtQ0tZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman has sparked controversy after revealing she uses cucumber water to fry an egg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-072fc440-3fca-11f0-8acf-5fc668d44351"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; user who goes by the handle @jana.dvll on the video-sharing platform recently posted a video in which she uses a cucumber instead of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Germany-based influencer claimed in her video caption that she learned about the oil alternative from an unnamed 'Italian grandmother'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her video, which has been viewed over 16.8 million times on TikTok, Jana rubs the cut end of a whole cucumber directly on the bottom of her frying pan on the stove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then cracks an egg straight into the pan.

I am still using oil, because it's healthy and we need it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using plant-based oils - such as olive, avocado, sunflower, canola, corn, and grapeseed - has been linked to better health outcomes, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 30-year study of more than 200,000 adults conducted by researchers at Harvard University found that people who cook with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14473497/harvard-study-discovery-health-impact-seed-oils-rfk-jr.html"&gt;these types of oils instead of butter were less likely to die of any cause&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were 'surprised' to find swapping less than a tablespoon of butter for the same amount of oil lowered the overall risk of death by 17 percent, which the team called 'a pretty huge effect on health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested this could be because seed oils are lower than butter in saturated fat, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unlikely there would be any health benefit to using a cucumber instead of oil to cook, the mild-flavoured vegetable became a surprising favourite among TikTok users thanks to recipes shared by Canadian content creator Logan Moffitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Logan's &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13766579/cucumber-guy-bland-vegetable-viral-bizarre-recipes.html"&gt;recipes for sliced cucumbers went completely viral&lt;/a&gt; last year, sharing combinations such as soy sauce, chili oil, garlic, sugar and MSG, and salmon, cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 06:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQdWVHSmhfZk80VW82MHIyVVlDYVRPRl9vQmZ0SkplYU5tSW41RmpfTmJhdmkwbTJLc0hsODJEbzRPc2FIQ2ZfNzZ1bDB6MWRDc1FwQ196RFRzbWktYUZmMGY2MmhRN3ZBQ0Q0Ykg5Y29ZaVEwdEZoMkl3UFVGSWdWbWtXVVFoMWdzVTc1N2MteHR1Q1B5Z1ZrcWx5SDNDWVJaTi1ydWNSelRJc3NtQ0tZ</guid></item><item><title>糖尿病影响眼睛的5种方式-印度时报 | 5 ways Diabetes impacts the eyes - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxPNVZMNlBGV0I0ek12bnd1QUhNeWV0SVFkOGJqRkhYTGtmYXAwVVRHMVNoTWdYUDFvZnl0Z29IVTdDMGw0VExRdUpBNjNGaENTVUNWZUdDWVh2eWFDTnoxV1Vid05UUWpSWktpamhUS1hmeVk0b1hjOFR0UkV5YWxZZmRqRTdBMkdDS3kyaC1sSnhZbmFPNVRpVHBpRFl3VVp4b0NxQVZGd1JFRkRUOXhKUXB3YUIxaVRYMldqVnc1bGVqNnhfemtSTlNrdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye disease caused by diabetes.

In more severe cases, new weak blood vessels grow and may bleed, causing vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, diabetic retinopathy may not cause any symptoms, but as it worsens, you may notice blurry vision, dark spots, or floaters.

			&lt;p&gt;Historians have for a long time believed that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to the Americas by European settlers, but the latest research offers strong evidence to the contrary – suggesting that Indigenous Americans had already been dying of the disease for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary cause of leprosy is a bacterium called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae"&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the researchers still think this was introduced to America by Europeans. However, it seems a lesser-known culprit was already established by that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study from an international team of researchers found that another bacterium, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_lepromatosis"&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – a less common cause of leprosy infection – was present in the DNA of ancient human remains from Canada and Argentina dating back at least a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in America," &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/revelations-history-leprosy-americas"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genomicist Maria Lopopolo, from the Institut Pasteur in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shows that a form of the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations well before the Europeans arrived."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria was first discovered in a patient in the US in 2008, and since then it's also been found in red squirrels &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sciurus vulgaris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; in the UK. It may well have spread from the US to the UK in the 19th century, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In partnership with local Indigenous communities in terms of handling ancestral remains, the researchers analyzed the DNA from a total of 389 ancient and 408 modern human samples. From the results, they put together a genetic family tree of leprosy bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163305" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap.jpg" alt="Leprosy May Have Existed in The Americas Long Before Colonization Introduced It" class="wp-image-163305 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap-446x415.jpg 446w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap-600x558.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163305" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked leprosy bacteria species across America. (Lopopolo et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though they were thousands of kilometers apart, the ancient Canadian and Argentinian samples were remarkably genetically similar. That points to a rapid spread of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; across the American continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the timeline put together from the DNA, the different strains of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; would have split from a common ancestor more than 9,000 years ago. With that many millennia of evolution under its belt, the team says there are likely even more diverse forms of the bacteria still waiting to be discovered in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are just beginning to uncover the diversity and global movements of this recently identified pathogen," &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/revelations-history-leprosy-americas"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biologist Nicolás Rascovan, from the Institut Pasteur. "The study allows us to hypothesize that there might be unknown animal reservoirs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all adds a valuable extra layer to our understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-texts-suggest-italian-sailors-knew-about-america-way-before-columbus"&gt;the history of the Americas&lt;/a&gt;, and of leprosy. It gives researchers some incredibly useful data points in terms of the progression and diversification of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/in-medieval-england-leprosy-jumped-between-squirrels-and-humans"&gt;the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious diseases play an important part in the story of North, South, and Central America, with the arrival of Europeans introducing a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-says-europeans-killed-so-many-indigenous-americans-the-planet-cooled-down"&gt;host of new pathogens&lt;/a&gt; that Indigenous communities weren't biologically prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know that the leprosy part of the picture is a lot more complicated than we previously realized. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy"&gt;Around 200,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-warn-leprosy-isnt-ancient-history-as-cases-surge-in-the-us"&gt;disease are reported&lt;/a&gt; worldwide every year, though it can now be treated and cured with modern drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study clearly illustrates how ancient and modern DNA can rewrite the history of a human pathogen and help us better understand the epidemiology of contemporary infectious diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/revelations-history-leprosy-americas"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rascovan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking the drug for one to three years was associated with a 10 percent decline in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were from the Veterans Affairs database, and most were over 50 years old, but researchers said their results suggested metformin could potentially be used to help prevent colon cancer for wider groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uncontrolled diabetes is a risk factor for the disease, so treating it in general may lower cancer risk, but using metformin may provide additional benefits, as previous research has shown the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13337751/metformin-diabetes-anti-aging-trial.html"&gt;drug has been linked to slowed aging and reduced mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular podcaster Joe Rogan, 57, who hasn't revealed if he is taking the drug himself, often talks about the medication on his podcast, with expert guests touting its potential longevity benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One guest, Harvard anti-aging scientist Dr David Sinclair claimed it could help to slow aging - and in an interview with Dr Sinclair in 2019, Rogan said: 'I got to find a quack that's willing to prescribe me metformin.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study suggests that metformin, which Joe Rogan has mentioned repeatedly on his popular podcast, could help to reduce the risk of colon cancer on the left side of the colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metformin has been approved for type 2 diabetics but is prescribed off label for a range of ailments. Researchers are also looking at whether it could be used to fight aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed at ASCO 2025, the world's largest cancer conference taking place this week in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While promising, scientists behind the paper did not provide an explanation as to why the drug may be protective and said their results needed to be confirmed with more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metformin is a prescription-only medication approved for type 2 diabetics to help them control blood sugar levels, with patients taking about two pills per day - sometimes priced at as little as 20 cents a pill. It is estimated that over 19 million Americans are prescribed it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is also prescribed off-label for a number of other conditions, including prediabetes and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a condition in which women experience cysts on their ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists from The Jusidman Cancer Center in Israel analyzed data on patients in the Veterans Affairs database from 1999 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recruited patients on metformin and matched them to patients with similar characteristics not on metformin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tended to be less healthy patients, which raises the risk of a colon cancer diagnosis or comorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the metformin group, the majority of patients had used the substance for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, data was available on the location of the tumor for more than 113,000 patients in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 13,691 were in the metformin group - including 9,588 (70 percent) who developed colon cancer on the left side of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 100,000 people were in the non-metformin group - including 95,000 (95 percent) who developed the cancer on the left side of their colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Colon cancer is increasingly striking young people. Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee (pictured), died of colon cancer at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers work was published as&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT483236"&gt; an abstract &lt;/a&gt;by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has not been made fully available or peer reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, previously published work has found similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from 2019 found metformin was associated with an eight percent reduction in colorectal cancer. By location, it was associated with a 14 percent reduction in the risk of cancer in the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study looked at the expression of HCT116 cells - those found in colon cancer patients. When these cells grow abnormally, it contributes to tumor progression, but metformin altered the expression of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed the medication upregulated genes that may suppress the growth and spread of colorectal cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 2024 study found metformin use was associated with 'significantly lower' colon cancer risk in both the colon and rectum - about a 30 percent decline in risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an increased protective effect was observed in white people and those with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers concluded metformin's benefits 'likely generalizes to populations with higher underlying risk.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bird flu — specifically the H5N1 strain of avian influenza — is deadly and unpredictable, and it continues to evolve in ways that have raised real concerns among virologists and public health experts. Historically, about half the people infected with the virus have died — and unlike other respiratory viruses, it doesn’t spare the young or healthy. The virus, traditionally confined to birds (thus the name), is now spreading more broadly among mammals. There have been large-scale die-offs of seals. More recently, there have been infections among bears, in more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;1,000 herds of dairy cows&lt;/a&gt;, and among the people and animals, like cats, that have come in contact with these cows and their milk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the United States, dozens of people have tested positive for H5N1, many of whom are workers on dairy farms. One person — a man over the age of 65 from Louisiana — died earlier this year. Globally, the virus has also caused other tragic outcomes, including the death of a&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-bird-flu-h5n1-4c8a2bc81e565e2948e237c676094415" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; 3-year-old girl&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico and an &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/cambodia-reports-11-year-boy-countrys-fourth-bird-122259228" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;11-year-old boy&lt;/a&gt; in Cambodia after exposure to sick birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To date, nearly all known human cases have likely come from direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, such as milk. Many of these kinds of infections — the ones that come from physical contact as opposed to respiratory droplets — can be milder, including pink eye-like symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The virus has yet to spread easily from person to person. That could change, and H5N1 could spread airborne, similar to COVID-19. And if it does, the world could be staring down a pandemic far worse than COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That’s the threat that prompted the Biden administration to invest in next-generation vaccines against H5N1. It awarded a $600 million contract to Moderna — the folks who developed one of the first successful and effective mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines — to develop an mRNA-based vaccine against H5N1. That’s the contract Kennedy has canceled. It’s a decision that defies logic and appears rooted in both a hatred of vaccines and a fear of the mRNA platform. Most importantly, it puts the lives and health of the American people at risk and undercuts years of scientific progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;We’ve seen what’s possible when we invest early. The mRNA platform that gave the nation life-saving COVID-19 vaccines was the result of more than a decade of research, much of it funded by the National Institutes of Health. Scientists spent years studying coronaviruses, particularly the original SARS virus, and developed a detailed game plan for a vaccine against that virus. That foundational work gave our nation a head start when SARS-CoV-2 hit, allowing the quick development of vaccines and for Operation Warp Speed, which took place during the first Trump administration, to test those vaccines rapidly. That same foresight was driving the Moderna bird flu contract and research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Developing and refining an mRNA vaccine demands testing and time. Scientists must design and test the antigen, determine optimal dosing, and assess safety and effectiveness — work that takes months and often years. Waiting to develop a vaccine candidate until the world is actually confronting a bird flu pandemic would leave America dangerously behind. That’s why investing in a human vaccine is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/20/opinion/bird-flu-trump-vaccine/#:~:text=The%20virus%20now%20infects%20a,lions%20to%20cats%20to%2C%20most" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;top&lt;/a&gt; things I said the Trump administration must do to combat bird flu. To be sure, the federal government does have a small stockpile of old H5N1 vaccines — but it’s not clear they would work against emerging strains. What is clear is that the mRNA platform could be used to build targeted vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This is exactly the kind of public health challenge the government should address. There’s no viable commercial market for an H5N1 vaccine — and if we’re lucky, there never will be. We cannot rely on the private sector to invest in pandemic prevention. And waiting to develop vaccines until a pandemic has started is like telling a fire department to start hiring after a neighborhood has gone up in flames.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The rationale behind the contract’s cancellation doesn’t hold up. HHS cited safety concerns with mRNA vaccines, calling continued investment in Moderna’s vaccine “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/health/moderna-trump-bird-flu-vaccine-contract.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;not scientifically or ethically justifiable&lt;/a&gt;.” That’s nonsense. mRNA is a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mrna-human-cells-covid-vaccines-652839101994" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;naturally occurring molecule&lt;/a&gt; found in nearly every human cell. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines underwent some of the most rigorous clinical trials in history, involving more than &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/safety-efficacy-mrna-vaccines-amid-recent-scrutiny/story?id=122068940" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;70,000 participants&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, about &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-covid-vaccinations" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;2 billion&lt;/a&gt; of these mRNA vaccines have been administered globally. Yes, they have rare side effects — all medicines do — but their safety profile is extraordinarily strong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This isn’t just about H5N1. The mRNA platform is a breakthrough technology that can be adapted for a wide range of threats, from emerging viruses to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01151-7#:~:text=A%20phase%20I%20trial%20was,samples%20taken%20from%20their%20tumours." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Canceling a project like this is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/opinion/biomedical-research-trump-science-cuts-brain-drain/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;scientific sabotage that undermines years of investment&lt;/a&gt; and slows progress across the board. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The federal government should be investing and working to expand the nation’s scientific and public health arsenal, not shrinking it. The systems we build today — the research, the platforms, the partnerships — are what protect us tomorrow. Canceling this contract undermines progress, weakens readiness, and increases the odds that we’ll be caught flat-footed when the next pandemic strikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And if that pandemic is driven by a virus as deadly as bird flu, the cost won’t just be measured in dollars — it will be measured in lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxONFdpaWlieHhzdzQ4TmxwbHhJSXVPclB0cUhDVFg3alpWaXFuV3N3dkpGdGg3aTFTT0dzUG1VaVp5XzFSUVRKSGdMNzFqUDdja1dzdzVqUjNPb1h4bE90TE1MdDJ2NUx5aEJUd2FMaUhseWZyY0RCZXBmZG5oY2ozYkJJM1NxV3kwQlNyWTA1SExFYXJXTmtUc3RYdmMtX2ZUSlotQm13</guid></item><item><title>医生一直在说糖不好-但他们错过了这一点-SciTechDaily | Doctors Have Been Saying Sugar Is Bad – But They Missed This - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPdktvNDFUSGtqVVREcGN6MXlEaWkwRi1OREx1M05yd1VJbUhQTlNENzU2YVFQTEJFRjBJMmNpRlVISHVBdldSZWdpbTN2Z0lELXlPRUlDT3RhdzZqQWVqNVhLT1RtQ3JTWHRuWERoZDh5NDhnaldYd1JPNDFCZFRzTVc2REVCLURXbW5mSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:49:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPdktvNDFUSGtqVVREcGN6MXlEaWkwRi1OREx1M05yd1VJbUhQTlNENzU2YVFQTEJFRjBJMmNpRlVISHVBdldSZWdpbTN2Z0lELXlPRUlDT3RhdzZqQWVqNVhLT1RtQ3JTWHRuWERoZDh5NDhnaldYd1JPNDFCZFRzTVc2REVCLURXbW5mSg</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，食用牛奶可以改善肠道生物多样性，奶酪可以减少某些微生物- Earth.com | New study shows that milk consumption improves gut biodiversity and cheese reduces certain microbes - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVTdrdEZVaGFBS1R6dXNTaXNocXExWDZodkZfUXA4ZzhTclYwUkFtN1JxTHRXRFJ2OFRiTndjLWFzLXJDX01neHhBdUNTaG5rYU9reXlwRkw3N1dzMEYtVzQxWFVGMElDSWR6dFNsQ0k2cDFLZVRQeFJIcmdQV3NYRGROVnFMR0FPdHVhVlBabzBMb2FUYVY1eG45blhDRTk0S2RjaUZXUEwzVFhia21taw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk is a staple in many households. It has long been valued for nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, yet new data hint at another benefit that involves the intricate community of microbes inside the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent findings, led by &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/li-jiao-23845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Li Jiao&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, shows that milk consumption is connected with an uptick in several helpful bacteria, while cheese may reduce certain microbes important for a balanced intestinal environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-dairy-helps-the-gut"&gt;How dairy helps the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say dairy interacts with the microbiome, which is the mix of microorganisms in the body that help break down nutrients. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-types-of-plant-based-milk-are-linked-to-mental-disorders-like-depression/"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; seems to support a broader range of gut microbes, a sign of a more adaptable gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have explored the role of milk in encouraging the growth of bacteria linked to lower inflammation and improved gut barriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590046/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; suggest this trend could relate to the carbohydrate content in dairy, but details remain under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-examining-key-bacteria"&gt;Examining key bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several dairy-linked microbes stand out. One is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10410495/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/a&gt;, known for producing substances that help maintain gut balance and calm inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/a&gt;, often mentioned for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29902436/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to healthy weight and blood sugar control. Investigators say these bacteria can be more abundant in the gut when milk intake rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese appears to bring different consequences by reducing Bacteroides, which are common gut residents that may influence colon conditions. It also seems to lower &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996404000071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subdoligranulum&lt;/a&gt;, a genus thought to play a part in metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have noticed that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/bifidobacterium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as a probiotic, may increase with certain dairy habits too. This possibility has drawn interest among professionals looking for dietary ways to support digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-yogurt-didn-t-reveal"&gt;What yogurt didn’t reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although yogurt is often praised for its probiotic potential, this study didn’t find clear links between yogurt intake and gut microbiota changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s likely because participants reported very low yogurt consumption overall, limiting meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough data, researchers couldn’t determine whether yogurt had the same effects on key bacteria like Akkermansia or Faecalibacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More diverse and higher yogurt intake in future studies may be needed to explore how fermented dairy compares to milk and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-intake-and-gut-health"&gt;Dairy intake and gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few researchers highlight that milk has more lactose, which might help raise the presence of healthful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteria-recreate-an-ancient-war-trick-to-defeat-viruses/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese, produced through fermentation, contains less lactose but includes other elements that might shape the gut in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians remind people that daily dairy recommendations can differ by age, lifestyle, and health status. Individuals who are sensitive to lactose or prone to certain digestive concerns might need to choose their dairy products carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in the United States advise around three cups of dairy daily, although personal needs vary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many folks fall short of this amount, which leaves a door open for considering how milk or cheese might add microbial variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-dietary-guidelines"&gt;Future dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts caution that these findings shouldn’t lead to broad assumptions about all dairy products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a small group of older men, and their average dairy intake was lower than national averages, so the results may not apply to other groups or dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the research adds weight to calls for more personalized dietary advice. Instead of focusing only on dairy quantity, future guidelines might need to emphasize the type of dairy product and its effects on gut &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-bacteria-found-on-chinese-space-station-has-never-been-seen-before/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; balance and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-of-small-scale-research"&gt;Limits of small-scale research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included only 34 participants, most of whom were older men. This limited sample size makes it hard to apply the findings to younger people, women, or more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the reliance on self-reported food frequency questionnaires introduces some uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don’t always remember their food habits accurately, which can affect how well their dairy intake matches up with microbiome changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-gut-health-and-the-future"&gt;Dairy, gut health, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies increasingly point to the idea that food choices affect more than just basic nutrition. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; consumption, in particular, is now tied to the presence of microbes that could protect against a variety of gut-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy consumption may influence host health by modulating the structure and composition of the colonic adherent gut microbiota,” said Dr. Jiao. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader health connection is an active topic, and future efforts may include trials that examine long-term changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to learn more about how each type of dairy modifies these microorganisms in people of different ages and backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also want to understand the range of nutrients, such as calcium or protein, that might work alongside gut microbes to keep digestion running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:27:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVTdrdEZVaGFBS1R6dXNTaXNocXExWDZodkZfUXA4ZzhTclYwUkFtN1JxTHRXRFJ2OFRiTndjLWFzLXJDX01neHhBdUNTaG5rYU9reXlwRkw3N1dzMEYtVzQxWFVGMElDSWR6dFNsQ0k2cDFLZVRQeFJIcmdQV3NYRGROVnFMR0FPdHVhVlBabzBMb2FUYVY1eG45blhDRTk0S2RjaUZXUEwzVFhia21taw</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州妇女用受感染的自来水冲洗鼻窦后死亡—以下是如何保护自己的安全-纽约邮报 | Texas woman died after rinsing sinuses with infected tap water — here’s how to keep yourself safe - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNamM0NENWUDdIQzV5NEpXVlFfVHIwWFpwazY2ekJKNmo1QUN6a2Z3WDU3X2duQUR2VjdUNEtqYXFtRnlZN2VOcGRQbWVrWEtzTU80U3BlZzhFWXJtYTNEZ1JDeTNGOEF4b2UyOV9Sd2x4Umh0cS1BcTM4ckRjV2dXQ2xLLXJQdXRrZS10NE55Qjc2aTVKaEtfT1RRc1FhZlBkYjVpUUdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A 71-year-old woman reportedly contracted a brain infection from using tap water — and died from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether tap water is safe to consume where you live, experts advise against letting it go into your sinuses —  or you risk being exposed to a brain-eating condition, like this unidentified woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, if water contains amoeba — single-celled organisms — and it gets into a person’s nose, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/fl-person-dies-after-catching-brain-eating-amoeba-report/"&gt;it can travel to the brain and cause the fatal infection&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba” but the technical term for it is Naegleria fowleri, which is what most likely happened to this woman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Texas Department of State Health Services claims that the sink water in the area is safe to consume, they believe the woman rinsed her sinuses from an RV’s water system at a campground and was infected by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/13/lake-mead-officials-warn-of-rare-but-deadly-brain-eating-amoeba-found-present-in-hot-springs/"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/a&gt;, as explained by the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14773767/woman-Texas-dies-brain-eating-infection-naegleria-fowleri.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition — typically found in warm water lakes and rivers — is rare, but it’s deadly — killing almost 97% of people who contract it. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/state-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The CDC reported&lt;/a&gt; 157 confirmed cases in the nation between 1962 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And reportedly, Texas is one of the few US states that has the largest number of amoeba cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Texas, Florida has also fallen victim to this terrifying infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Florida woman contracted the brain-eating infection the same way the Texas woman did — and died from it.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts recommend a few different ways to avoid possibly getting infected with this condition.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The adult patient reportedly performed nasal rinsing daily with unboiled tap water, which is thought to be the source of the infection,” the CDC said in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.fox4now.com/charlotte-county/is-charlotte-countys-tap-water-safe-following-report-of-amoeba-infection"&gt;Fox 4. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24485-brain-eating-amoeba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Naegleria fowleri start to show up about 15 days after a person has been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can range from a mild fever, headache, nausea and vomiting — to more severe ones like a stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention, loss of balance and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once a person has been exposed and severely infected — even with treatment, most will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where someone lives and the quality of their area’s tap water — to avoid any potential exposure to this serious condition, experts recommend boiling water before rinsing sinuses with it or using distilled water, avoid going underwater in a bathtub or freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also recommended to supervise children playing with sprinklers, and if you haven’t been home in a few days, let water run for several minutes in sinks or showers to flush out stagnant water. &lt;/p&gt;

In the first stage, symptoms include a runny nose, cough and slight fever. The eyes may become red and sensitive to light while the fever rises each day. The second stage begins between three and seven days after symptoms start, with temperatures reaching 103 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and a red blotchy rash that lasts between four to seven days. The rash typically starts on the face before spreading to the shoulders, arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease and spreads through the air from an infected person," Dr. Joshua Clayton, state epidemiologist, told ABC News. "Individuals who lack immunity from vaccination or past infection are at high risk of measles infection if they have contact with an infected person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to state health officials, the measles vaccine offers the best protection against infection. People are considered immune to measles if they were born before 1957, received one dose of the measles vaccine (MMR) as an adult, received two doses of the measles vaccine (MMR) as a child or high-risk adult, have measles antibodies shown by a lab test, or had a previous measles infection confirmed by a lab test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Department of Health notes that the MMR vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at four to six years.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — The Washington Department of Health (DOH) said Monday it has detected a new &lt;a href="/coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; variant in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the DOH, health officials found 14 sequenced detections of NB.1.8.1 in Washington state. The earliest detection of the new variant was found April 7 and the most recent case is from May 20. Thirteen of the detections were found from the CDC &lt;a href="%7C36df3a36f9bd45616bed08dda20eb12e%7Cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7C1%7C0%7C638844906938479814%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ==%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=UGAsCZG1hy2fQgX5ajvOjsrfrERSQ3phzKKK%2FBqYPBg=&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" title="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fcovid.cdc.gov%2fcovid-data-tracker%2f%23traveler-genomic-surveillance&amp;amp;data=05%7c02%7ckgilbert%40king5.com%7c36df3a36f9bd45616bed08dda20eb12e%7cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7c1%7c0%7c638"&gt;Traveler Genomics Program&lt;/a&gt;, which tests samples from the SEA Airport. The other instance was submitted by the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the detections were confirmed in Washington state, health officials said in a Monday release they could not determine if the people tested are residents of Washington or if they spent time in the state after the sample was collected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) considers NB.1.8.1 a variant because it is rising in frequency in regions where it has been detected. The organization said the public health risk posed by the variant is low. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data does not indicate that the variant causes more severe disease than its predecessors, according to the WHO. Health officials believe the current vaccine strains are expected to protect against symptomatic and severe disease for NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington DOH urged all eligible residents to stay up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — What began as an international journey from Turkey to Mexico turned into a race against time last Friday when a 35-year-old woman suffered a mid-flight medical emergency. Thanks to quick-thinking passengers, a skilled doctor on board, and the coordinated efforts of Houston-area medical teams,  Maricela Hernandez Quezada is alive and on the road to a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the flight, Hernandez Quezada began showing signs of distress. A doctor  who was also a passenger on the flight recognized the symptoms of a stroke and sprang into action.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doctor administered oxygen, monitored her condition and alerted the flight crew to the severity of the emergency, according to Memorial Hermann Hospital. The plane diverted for an unscheduled stop at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She was found to be weak and paralyzed on the right arm, right leg completely, as well as having trouble with her speech, where she could not comprehend what was being told to her," said Dr. Haris Kamal with Memorial Hermann Northeast. "And in terms of output of speech, she was having a word salad, or the wrong words were coming out jumbled up."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was kind of in shock because I knew, it was I like I was healthy and I don't smoke. I don't drink. And I thought, ‘Wow, how is this possible,’” Hernandez Quezada said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramedics met the aircraft on the tarmac and rushed Hernandez Quezada to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital. There, she was stabilized before being flown by Life Flight to Memorial Hermann in The Woodlands, where a team was already preparing for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the emergency procedure, Hernandez Quezada was paralyzed on her right side and unable to speak. After the successful removal of a life-threatening brain clot, she is now walking, talking, and is expected to make a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal removed the clot with a catheter inserted in her leg. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I expect her to continue this trajectory of improvement to hopefully being near normal or normal in a few months’ time, where anyone who would be speaking with her would probably not be able to tell that she had literally just been through a major neurological event,” Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What caused Hernandez Quezada's stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal said in this case, the long plane ride with Hernandez Quezada not staying hydrated and not getting up to stretch most likely resulted with a blood clot in her leg that traveled to her brain. She easily could have died.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel blessed because all the doctors and nurses that have care of me,” she said. “And I just feel like a new person.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do you know the signs of a stroke? Familiarize yourself with B.E. F.A.S.T&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs of a stroke are not that hard to remember, especially if you remember the word "B.E. F.A.S.T."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"B.E. F.A.S.T." is a helpful acronym. It’s the signs of a stroke and knowing them could potentially be lifesaving. It stands for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
