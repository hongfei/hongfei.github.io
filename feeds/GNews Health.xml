&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 &lt;strong&gt;Groundbreaking IVF technique&lt;/strong&gt; successfully delivers eight healthy babies in the UK, free from severe mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌟 The new method, called &lt;strong&gt;Mitochondrial Donation Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;, uses DNA from three sources to prevent the transmission of harmful mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👶 Significant reduction in &lt;strong&gt;mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed, with all children healthy at birth and minimal health issues reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Despite its success, this procedure remains &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; and unapproved in many countries, sparking ethical debates on genetic intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advancements in in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology have once again brought hope and joy to families worldwide. In a remarkable achievement, United Kingdom doctors have successfully delivered eight healthy babies using an innovative DNA-enhanced IVF method. This groundbreaking technique, aimed at preventing the transmission of severe mitochondrial diseases, has proven effective in giving these children a disease-free start in life. The news not only marks a significant milestone in reproductive medicine but also raises intriguing ethical and scientific discussions about the future of genetic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Mitochondrial Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria, often referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;powerhouses of the cell&lt;/strong&gt;, play a crucial role in energy production. Despite their small size, they contain a separate set of DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA inherited from both parents. When mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, it can lead to serious health issues. These mutations can severely affect energy supply to vital organs such as the heart, muscles, and brain, often resulting in developmental delays and a shortened lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, around &lt;strong&gt;one in 5,000 newborns&lt;/strong&gt; are affected by these debilitating conditions, experiencing symptoms like vision loss and muscle weakening. The recent breakthrough in IVF technology, known as Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), offers a promising solution. By utilizing healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, this technique aims to eliminate the risk of inheriting such diseases, providing a healthier future for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cM5cjTCL7P"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/its-like-teleporting-knowledge-this-breakthrough-optical-ai-chip-transfers-100-million-books-in-just-7-minutes-using-light-speed-data/"&gt;“It’s Like Teleporting Knowledge”: This Breakthrough Optical AI Chip Transfers 100 Million Books in Just 7 Minutes Using Light-Speed Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Innovative Three-source Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new IVF technique, known as &lt;strong&gt;Pronuclear Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;, involves a revolutionary approach to conception. By combining DNA from three sources—the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm, and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor—this method ensures that the child inherits the vast majority of their traits from their biological parents. However, they also receive a small fraction (approximately 0.1%) of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This genetic alteration, while minute, is significant enough to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from an egg with a mitochondrial DNA mutation into a donor egg with its nucleus removed. The resulting embryo, which contains the parents’ nuclear DNA and the donor’s healthy mitochondrial DNA, is then implanted, leading to a successful pregnancy. This approach not only offers hope for affected families but also opens new doors in the field of genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zIWn6ShkUq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/nvidia-helix-destroys-ai-lag-forever-ultra-powerful-system-instantly-transforms-stalled-chatbots-into-million-word-lightning-fast-assistants-for-us-businesses/"&gt;“NVIDIA Helix Destroys AI Lag Forever”: Ultra-Powerful System Instantly Transforms Stalled Chatbots Into Million-Word, Lightning-Fast Assistants for US Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Promising Results and Ongoing Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study have been overwhelmingly positive, with a &lt;strong&gt;95-100% reduction in mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed in six of the babies. The remaining two showed a substantial reduction of 77-88%, well below the threshold for disease manifestation. All eight children were healthy at birth, with only minor, treatable health issues reported in a few cases. This success demonstrates the potential of the technique to transform lives, offering a disease-free future to children who might otherwise face severe health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its success, the procedure remains controversial and is not yet approved in many countries, including the US and France. Ethical objections include concerns about the destruction of human embryos and fears of the emergence of “designer babies.” These debates underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of genetic intervention, even as science continues to push boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hpe0Pfyv7f"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/it-transforms-while-flying-engineers-create-shape-shifting-robot-that-morphs-mid-air-to-land-and-roll-on-wheels/"&gt;“It Transforms While Flying”: Engineers Create Shape-Shifting Robot That Morphs Mid-Air to Land and Roll on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Considerations and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any groundbreaking scientific advancement, the development of MDT has sparked ethical debates. Critics argue that altering the genetic makeup of embryos raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the moral implications of such interventions. Supporters, however, emphasize the profound impact this technology can have on families affected by mitochondrial diseases, offering them a chance at a healthier future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of this procedure have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific and ethical considerations involved. As the technique continues to evolve, it will be crucial for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public to engage in open dialogues about the responsible use of genetic technologies. How will society balance the potential benefits of these advances with the ethical considerations they entail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Nassau County Health Department reports that there have been 25 positive rabies tests since last July. This marks the worst the situation has been in nearly a decade, since the county announced it had eradicated terrestrial rabies in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Most of the cases in Nassau are among raccoons and feral cats, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;a href="https://longisland.news12.com/health-officials-sixth-rabid-raccoon-found-in-amityville-area-this-year"&gt;In May, the Suffolk County Health Department &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;said it had identified six positive rabies cases in raccoons and all in Amityville. News 12 reached out early this morning for an update on rabies statistics in Suffolk County but has not yet heard back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adobe-dc-view-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say avoid feeding or touching wild animals or stray cats and dogs, make sure your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and keep pets indoors at night. Anyone who is bitten or scratched by an animal should seek immediate medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabies is a serious viral disease that affects the nervous system in mammals, including humans. While preventable by quickly vaccinating after an exposure, it is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Friday, the state Health Department issued a warning and urged New Yorkers to take steps to prevent rabies infections during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dopamine is one of the most extensively studied chemical messengers in the human brain, and yet scientists are still figuring out how it works to accomplish so much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, the classic view has been that, when released, dopamine slowly diffuses through the brain like a chemical megaphone, broadcasting information far and wide to numerous target cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recently, however, that perspective has changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.01.001"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newer research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that dopamine is also capable of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41972-6"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01803-8"&gt;sharp&lt;/a&gt; whispers, precisely directed within milliseconds to neighboring cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If researchers are right, this localized signal could be a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;fundamental building block&lt;/a&gt;" that's overlooked in the brain's dopamine system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-seems-to-have-a-blocking-effect-on-dopamine-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Caffeine Seems to Have a Blocking Effect on Dopamine, And Here's Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine in the brain is different to dopamine in the rest of the body. In the blood, dopamine helps modulate the function of multiple organs as well as our immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, it's a chemical messenger involved in mediating a diversity of animal behaviors &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from movement and mood to sleep and memory to reward and motivation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neurons that release dopamine are known to do so with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx6367"&gt;&lt;span&gt;different firing patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and yet it's not clear what messages these specific signals encode, or why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ability to send both fast &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; slow signals could explain how the brain's dopamine system can achieve so much with such specificity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png" alt="Dopamin Pathway" class="size-medium wp-image-168136" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-603x415.png 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-768x529.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-1536x1058.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-600x413.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The main dopamine pathway in the brain.

B&lt;/span&gt;roader dopamine release, meanwhile, is widespread and elicits a slower response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our current research found that dopamine signaling and transmission in the brain is much more complex than we thought," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; pharmacologist Christopher Ford from the University of Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We knew that dopamine plays a role in many different behaviors, and our work gives the beginning of a framework for understanding how all those different behaviors could all be regulated by dopamine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The specific neurons studied by Ford and colleagues come from the brain's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"&gt;&lt;span&gt;striatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – a part of the basal ganglia involved in motor and reward systems that is rich in dopamine-releasing neurons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The striatum receives dopamine inputs from various parts of the brain, and it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.12.004"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.033"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-024-03165-7"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parkinson's disease, for instance, is marked by a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;degeneration of dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt; connecting to the striatum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how dopamine sends signals in this part of the brain could be crucial for coming up with new treatments for a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are really only at the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand how dysfunctions in dopamine contribute to diseases like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or addiction," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"More work is needed to grasp how these specific changes in dopamine signaling are affected in these different neurological and psychiatric diseases."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He even went to see massage therapists and other physical therapists, but nothing helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was until he discovered a move called the reverse Jefferson curl, which he describes as a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-reverse-jefferson-curl"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reverse Jefferson curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move stretches and strengthens the muscles in the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found this movement late into my own rehab process after two years of persistent low back pain,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t a magic fix, but once I introduced it consistently—two to three times per week—I started noticing real improvements over a couple of months. It became a key part of the bigger picture that helped me recover.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move is particularly great for pain related to “tissue obstruction [after injury], segmental stiffness, or lack of posterior chain control”, according to Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5Li3Gi5AhL49zAVX2f5NGQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5Li3Gi5AhL49zAVX2f5NGQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-form-tips"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Form tips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner demonstrates the move in his Instagram reel above, but it’s important to do it with correct form to avoid injury, so we asked him for some extra tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For beginners, I recommend starting against a wall with your hands supporting your hips from behind,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focus on segmental spinal control first—no weight, slow tempo, and small range,” Kooner adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once comfortable, you can add resistance gradually,” he says. “I used only 3lbs in a backpack, and I wouldn’t suggest going above 10–15lbs, even at more advanced stages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete up to 10 repetitions, four to six times per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-the-reverse-jefferson-curl-is-so-great-for-combating-back-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why the reverse Jefferson curl is so great for combating back pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The spine is designed to move and bear load in all directions,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving your back muscles in different directions is key to improving mobility, flexibility and dealing with stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise helps improve spinal flexion strength and control, which are often neglected in rehab and training programs,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t try this exercise if your pain is severe or you have a specific injury. Consult a doctor before trying it and don't continue with the exercise if it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar. But new research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body's most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain's security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients. The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Study Reveals How This Artificial Sweetener May Cause Heart Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body's natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells' ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol's effect on the blood vessels' ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body's natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a "clot buster" called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke. But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced "blood vessel on a chip" systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar's sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It's now found in thousands of products, especially in many "sugar-free" and "keto-friendly" foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A man reaching for a protein bar in a shop." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such a protein bars.

But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even "natural" sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="168676" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain's protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261500/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A single drop in daily insulin can mean trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That story has shaped treatment for nearly a century, and in many places, it works. Yet most of the data behind that story comes from Europe and North America. What if a different chapter has been unfolding elsewhere all along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinics across &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;, nurses have long whispered to visiting researchers that some young patients labeled “type 1” seemed to hold on without insulin for weeks, even months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunch was hard to test – supplies are scarce, and lab work can be expensive – but the anecdotes kept piling up. Those whispers have now turned into evidence, and the findings are shaking up what we thought we knew &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;about diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-african-clinic-data"&gt;Surprising African clinic data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 900 children, teens, and young adults in Cameroon, Uganda, and South Africa joined a project called the Young-Onset Diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05013346?tab=table" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YODA&lt;/a&gt;) study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples, genetic scans, and clinical histories poured in. The results, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;, were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of participants lacked the autoimmune fingerprints that define classic type 1 diabetes, and the usual high-risk immune genes were missing as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 8.5 percent carried more than one diabetes-related autoantibody, a stark contrast to the roughly 90 percent seen within months of diagnosis in Western cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-redefining-the-diabetes-diagnosis"&gt;Redefining the diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the immune system destroying insulin-making cells, this new subtype looks like something else altogether – an insulin-deficient illness that has not yet revealed its trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sits outside type 2 diabetes, which is tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-diabetes-rate-has-doubled-reaching-over-800-million/"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t match malnutrition-related diabetes either. Clinicians had their suspicions; now the data back them up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new research findings confirm our long-standing suspicion. We have always wondered why many young people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes manage to survive without insulin, at least for some time, which would be unusual in typical type 1 diabetes,” said Dr Jean-Claude Katte of the &lt;a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-types-of-diabetes"&gt;Types of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YODA team compared African participants with more than 3,000 children and adolescents from the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.searchfordiabetes.org/dspHome.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth&lt;/a&gt; study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel pattern emerged in a small group of Black American children and was absent in White participants. That split hints at a mix of ancestral roots and environmental factors. It also rules out simple lab error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sample was tested with assays calibrated for African populations, and the same pattern appeared across three countries with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/carrots-may-help-manage-diabetes-by-improving-gut-health/"&gt;different diets&lt;/a&gt;, infections, and climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are a wake-up call. They challenge our assumptions about type 1 diabetes and show that the disease may present differently in African children and adolescents,” said Professor Moffat Nyirenda, who directs the &lt;a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-uganda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MRC/UVRI–LSHTM&lt;/a&gt; Uganda Research Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urgently need to deepen our investigations into the biological and environmental factors driving this form of diabetes and ensure our diagnostic and treatment approaches are fit for purpose in African settings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katte added, “Our next step is to investigate possible causes – ranging from infections and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-this-amount-of-water-per-day-helps-control-blood-sugar-levels-in-people-with-diabetes/"&gt;nutritional factors&lt;/a&gt; to environmental toxins. If we can find the cause, we may be able to prevent new cases and find new treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Eugene Sobngwi of Cameroon’s &lt;a href="https://www.minsante.cm/site/?q=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ministry of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; put it bluntly, saying, “We must invest in context-specific research. If we don’t, we risk misdiagnosing and mistreating millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-globally"&gt;What this means globally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly nine million people worldwide live with type 1 diabetes. If two out of every three young patients in parts of Africa actually have a different disease, the global numbers – and the research priorities that follow – need a hard look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mislabeling matters. Classic type 1 patients need lifelong insulin from day one; those with the new subtype may respond to therapies that protect or boost their still-working beta cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching that difference could spare families the cost and risk of unnecessary high-dose insulin while steering researchers toward fresh &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forgotten-organ-spleen-bioreactor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-therapy-forever/"&gt;prevention strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diagnosing-diabetes-type"&gt;Diagnosing diabetes type&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study leaves open questions. Autoantibodies can fade, so testing closer to the time of diagnosis could capture more detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, teasing apart infections, dietary patterns, and possible toxins will take careful fieldwork and, just as importantly, local funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the path is clear: broaden the research lens, update diagnostic manuals, and train healthcare teams to spot red flags – such as a young patient who stays stable on surprisingly little insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YODA data show that those cases are not rare outliers; they are part of a hidden majority in several African settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes textbooks will need an update, but the bigger story is about equity in science. Decades of work built on narrow datasets can miss whole chapters of human biology. Broadening the map doesn’t just help the regions being studied; it fine-tunes medicine for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 01:44:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPbF9JRHpuUmRpMHJxZl9USlRySGt5N1pFWktWSTN5bEFIZDlaaFhDUnJhZG9od2EyS0NkTjNEdUNkVDVqa2V0WFMwek1hT2oyTF9MN1NmTnVRTVVRU19nbUdMZVA4blJJdHUzZ2l3ZWVYbEQ0cS1GVWYzcFRKYkVKVzhoMUlLaTdyMi1nSmhDQ09yY2Y2NDNPYUV3ajMxWUxsenJBWEw5a3N0WEk</guid></item><item><title>美国罕见的食肉细菌呈上升趋势：病因、症状、高危人群、预防措施等-印度时报 | Rare flesh-eating bacteria on the rise in the US: Causes, symptoms, who is at risk, prevention and more - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgJBVV95cUxNWTdmZWVoX2M2djh3SldIeUtVUzdGaXFTVTcxWmNpNFlvTS1fMk9QODUwZF8zR01jUXJmNWNncnR0Sk9oellJakFUZVg5cmVEY2w3NHo0MmdWanplOG5NVGVFaUlPSzZCSXV0MG9KTFUzZ3hxSE9wRWdZZG4wc2xHRzcyZGVseHJXMmFZeEEtOUZOWk5RTUh4elR2OVJ3cFVGVnBEU0o2MlI4TWd0dG8yVUxOd1hnWGt0bjE2c0tiZ3dsNzNxM0hCTzF2bi1LbGlqTTU2OUFvS1NUNjRqNmZucHdQU1VVcFdFMUpFSTNoWU9VVGcwQzF1dmJleGwyWWdlY1EzdDhkOUZ5Sm9tbFdPOTRnVlpRbjF0ODVCWUgyUGRxMmwzc1HSAasCQVVfeXFMTkZLeW1MbGlaWGg0UVZnYlc5S0gtNnFYN0hhN1BlWEpvTlppNzh3UVUxNkhCMmRsNjkwUVczWmJFUC1USEpLOGFWQUJkWEhsR0FwU2ptampuOExfVzFlYjBzVmsxT2Zua001bnNuTXNhR0VMM3huRkVjSnJaMWlaaTl6SlZNTVp4eDI3LU1qUHktbXBvSHZSZ1FEa25ncHRKM3RPcDZDN0NyR2tjQ2dRNWpBdXBuNk1pa1RNTGRYa2h3NUVBVm1YY0hXVFktV3h3ZG1LQ2daZHhxSjJSaXlRdkgySDAzZW8yWFd3WnRNNUFUeVQyX1lseVRfbFVxLXVOOGlmSUJSX2g0Vi1Uakx2TnV2eE9pdnQxQklFa095Y1Q0azlYakd4N2x0cms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warm temperatures of the summer are perfect breeding climates for a variety of bacteria that thrive in increasing temperatures.

The infections are mostly caused by the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked seafood, when an open wound comes into contact with the bacteria-infected coastal waters, or when someone swallows the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the deaths due to the bacteria occurred in Bay, Broward, Hillsborough and St. Johns counties. Other cases have been confirmed in Duval, Escambia, Lee, Manatee, Santa Rosa and Walton counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria pose a high risk to individuals with weak immune systems or chronic health conditions. "People who are most at risk are immunocompromised — people with cirrhosis, people on chemo, anybody who has a compromised immune system of any kind," said Dr. Edward Hirsch, an infectious disease specialist at HCA Florida University Hospital, to CBS NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27905887" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-Vibrio-Vulnificus" source="keywords"&gt;symptoms of Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

With open wounds, symptoms can be discolouration, swelling, skin breakdown and ulcers. According to Hirsch, "It progresses to making a hole in whatever part of your body got infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is Vibrio Vulnificus a flesh-eating bacteria?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria don't eat, but kill the tissue.

			&lt;p&gt;Dogs really can be trained to smell  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="168151" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease, according to new research from the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a double blind trial, a Golden Retriever and a Labrador were able to sniff out which skin swabs came from people with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smell of the oily secretions seemed to hold secret clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dogs in this study achieved high sensitivity and specificity and showed there is an olfactory signature distinct to patients with the disease," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; animal behavioral scientist Nicola Rooney from the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sensitivity levels of 70 percent and 80 percent are well above chance, and I believe that dogs could help us to develop a quick, non-invasive, and cost-effective method to identify patients with Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-smell-is-tightly-linked-to-the-visual-parts-of-their-brain?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Dogs Might Actually 'See' Through Smells, Brain Scans Suggest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is no definitive early test for Parkinson's, which is why scientists are so interested in finding potential biomarkers of the disease on our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168154" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/peanutsniff-article.jpg" alt="Dog Parkinson's Test" class="wp-image-168154 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168154" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A dog smelling a skin swab from a person with or without &lt;span&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/span&gt; disease. &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;(Medical Detection Dogs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that Parkinson's distinctly changes a person's body odor first came to light roughly a decade ago – all because of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-can-smell-parkinson-s-and-could-be-the-key-to-an-early-detection-test"&gt;one woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years before her husband's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, Joy Milne could &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html"&gt;sense&lt;/a&gt; something was off – specifically, she could &lt;i&gt;smell&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milne, a Scottish nurse, is known as a 'super-smeller', and in 2016, she became famous among neuroscientists for her extraordinary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00396-8"&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt;, Milne correctly identified each patient with Parkinson's disease based solely on the scent of their shirts. Her one misidentification &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html"&gt;turned out to be correct&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news raised an important question: If someone like Milne could smell Parkinson's years before it was diagnosed, could a dog do the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs are known to have incredible senses of smell, far more powerful than our own. Previous studies have found our pets can smell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-body-smells-when-its-stressed-and-your-dog-can-sniff-it-out"&gt;our stress&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-deployed-at-helsinki-airport-can-detect-covid-19-with-near-perfect-accuracy"&gt;coronavirus infections&lt;/a&gt;, and even our &lt;a href="https://www.roswellpark.org/cancertalk/202008/can-dogs-smell-cancer"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; – so if a distinct odor for Parkinson's does exist, then maybe a dog can sniff it out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, a few &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29180"&gt;preliminary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-024-01902-5"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; have provided evidence for that hypothesis. But some only gave limited information on how the dogs were trained and tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168156" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/bumper-article.jpg" alt="Dog Smelling Parkinson's" class="size-full wp-image-168156" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168156" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A golden retriever smelling a skin swab. &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;(Medical Detection Dogs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent trial from the UK is a collaboration between a program called Medical Detection Dogs and neuroscientists at the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One goal of the research is to figure out what the dogs are actually smelling, and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, for instance, researchers at Manchester helped &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00879"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; which odor compounds set the distinctive smell of Parkinson's apart. Their results were later confirmed by Milne, the serendipitous "super-smeller".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years on, the odor compounds were used to create a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;diagnostic 'swab test'&lt;/a&gt; for Parkinson's, currently in testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, further down the road, trained dogs could help neuroscientists identify more unique biomarkers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, though, not all canines are up to snuff. In the current trial, only 2 out of 10 dogs made it through training, and neither performed perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dog, for instance, falsely flagged a tenth of the odor swabs from healthy people as having Parkinson's. The other gave false alarms less than 2 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, the dogs could smell which person had Parkinson's at a rate well above chance, providing proof of principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely proud to say that once again, dogs can very accurately detect disease," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Claire Guest, the CEO of Medical Detection Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is currently no early test for Parkinson's disease and symptoms may start up to 20 years before they become visible and persistent leading to a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Timely diagnosis is key… "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1877718X251342485"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But nearly all of the 10 panelists bucked medical consensus on the drugs’ safety and emphasized what they said were risks of taking the drugs while pregnant — such as causing autism, miscarriages or birth defects. In some cases, they claimed that antidepressants don’t work at all and that depression goes away on its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d91b73" class="body-graf"&gt;Three of the 10 panelists were from outside the United States. Another runs a clinic to help people taper off of psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-705f71" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were really rousing concerns about safety that are not evidence-based or established and not at all balanced with concerns about the risks of untreated depression,” said Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28e326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Payne, director of the Reproductive Psychiatry Research Program at the University of Virginia, said, “I’m disappointed that the FDA brought people in from outside of the United States when there’s so many experts here in the United States who truly know this [medical] literature inside and out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecf419" class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that the claim that the panel was one-sided was “insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers who dedicate their expertise to these panels.” The spokesperson added that FDA Commissioner Martin Makary “has an interest in ensuring policies reflect the latest gold standard science and protect public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb248a" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-ssri-antidepressants-children-doctors-risks-studies-rcna192722" target="_blank"&gt;called for a probe into the risks of antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-children-dire-chronic-disease-health-report-rcna208544" target="_blank"&gt;“Make America Healthy Again” report in May&lt;/a&gt; claimed there were “potentially major long-term repercussions” associated with use of the drugs in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d89ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel discussion focused on a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which includes Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft. The medications increase levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that can improve mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9556e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists often advise women who are taking SSRIs to continue doing so during pregnancy, since the risks of untreated depression tend to outweigh the potential risks of the medication to mother and child. However, the decision is a personal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-053b05" class="body-graf"&gt;For ethical reasons, there are no randomized-control trials of SSRIs in pregnant women, meaning data on potential risks mostly comes from observational studies and drug registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b232c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some babies born to mothers taking SSRIs may develop symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability or difficulty eating or sleeping that resolve quickly — what’s known as “neonatal adaptation syndrome.” The symptoms may be caused by medication in the babies’ systems or withdrawal from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c32b66" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain studies have also found a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543237/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly elevated risk of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy, though others have found &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1656691" target="_blank"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt;. However, there’s no convincing evidence to suggest that SSRIs are linked to autism or birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89ccc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Well-controlled studies continue to not find an association,” Payne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2e139" class="body-graf"&gt;Women with histories of depression are also at an increased risk of symptoms’ recurring during pregnancy, and depression can come with its own risks — including thoughts of self-harm or low birth weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1398cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing a pregnant individual could do for herself and her baby is to get the treatment that they need,” said Dr. Nancy Byatt, a perinatal psychiatrist at UMass Chan Medical School, who wasn’t part of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2da935" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to raising concerns about side effects, several panelists questioned the efficacy of antidepressants or suggested that data favoring the use of SSRIs was manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810182" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s been said that SSRIs help people who are severely depressed. They don’t,” said David Healy, an FDA panelist and fellow at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96fb04" class="body-graf"&gt;Goldberg and other psychiatrists said that’s simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1816ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can say the moon landing was faked. Conspiracy theories abound in our world. But there is not a doubt about whether SSRIs work,” said Goldberg, a past president of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology who has previously consulted for pharmaceutical companies. He said he was invited to join the FDA panel but declined because the language of the invitation suggested it wouldn’t be a fair discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c6621" class="body-graf"&gt;Healy, the panelist, also claimed that some people “recover spontaneously” from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b538fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Another panelist, psychologist Roger McFillin — who hosts a podcast that challenges conventional mental health advice — suggested that depression wasn’t an illness but rather a product of “women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely.” He added, without evidence, that many women feel coerced into taking antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-78bd4e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists who weren’t part of the discussion broadly decried those characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0874d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“I have never, ever, ever, ever heard of a third party pushing a prescription in pregnancy,” Goldberg said. However, he said he is aware of some obstetrician-gynecologists who aren’t as familiar with SSRIs who have wrongly told pregnant patients to stop taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26af8" class="body-graf"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday that SSRIs can be lifesaving for some pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-792417" class="body-graf"&gt;“Today’s FDA panel on SSRIs and pregnancy was alarmingly unbalanced and did not adequately acknowledge the harms of untreated perinatal mood disorders in pregnancy,” it said. “On a panel of 10 experts, only one spoke to the importance of SSRIs in pregnancy as a critical tool, among others, in preventing the potentially devastating effects of anxiety and depression when left untreated during pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0dfc4f" class="body-graf"&gt;One panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, a psychiatrist and an OB-GYN at the University of Florida College of Medicine, was the most vocal advocate for using SSRIs, often pushing back against others’ assessments of the risks. Psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel praised her science-backed commentary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c96" class="body-graf"&gt;“All of us can find a study that agrees with exactly what we think,” Roussos-Ross told the panel. “But we need to look at the data very objectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032c36" class="body-graf"&gt;Several psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel said they worry that the discussion could lead to regulatory action that makes it harder to access SSRIs. For example, one panelist, Dr. Adam Urato, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, called for stronger warnings on SSRI labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-97e619" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I am just very nervous that some of the discourse around the risks of antidepressants could lead to even more barriers for people seeking care,” said Dr. Lindsay Lebin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who wasn’t part of the FDA discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 23:10:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPVjhJUnU3NGh6bEE1M2xTRUNRUmU5WjRuRG5Xc012MHNJWVFfbkxQUGFiZXluc2U4YXpkZ1ctWTl3S0JxaDViOVF3cTNGckoxMEQ5cFRXVDBIaFZvaDJ0WmNZN2l2bVZQSTBXenpGNUVxM2xEeFNEeWVncGRVU3ZvWXJnOTVDXzJJZ2M1WS1udXdIQnN3LVg4QWxtSnNMVm5hRjFJSWt3VlFDUHh0bzJLcldHY0RENldmQWx0dzZXRGN3NV930gFWQVVfeXFMUFhfcmR3NHF0dFBkdGZGMVZaTUVQYU1WVmY5TmgxODJkd3pPS1F4aDBLcHFQM2EtNFUzWVE3aUphUmNHTnZIVS1UOEJqeEExNHpJNXJ3aWc</guid></item><item><title>永久化学物质现在与3500万美国人遭受的疾病有关-每日邮报 | Forever chemicals now linked to disease suffered by 35million Americans - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOa25QMmNzY01ub1QyblBoZWxQUnd3cFlYdWhNZ01RUS04dVpvUnpvZVlJOTZJR1VZUG5RUHpzaWtoeTRZTmpJV3NscURIZ1dvNmYxVFJ3SzZFUzFVWDlfT1BvSGxaVHlmMWlTNTIydWR5ZEZId0VUYi1UTVNKSkI5VUFkZldRc0htLU1nbnMySzZNYnY3cUY4YnB5b2HSAaIBQVVfeXFMTzZoNFpLM3RSMksyblVENU9SU1ZsWkpXSklpQ0lSNk5WcjZUY3hsSVowd3RzYzdGWXowMEg0WUU4UWxucS1pOVpVTDVDYi1VMmNCb2hCQmgtNTZOYWd0MXZtblNiZTJPcGVuLVNzek5oc2w4YTZpNTYyY05GOGNIT3B2LVE4cHRFVlZMN2ROY0ZROWtRYlRsNnl6Xy1NbjhNNWpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans exposed to 'forever chemicals' have up to a 31 percent higher risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-cb080990-dcce-11ef-8f7d-5fa74eb7f182"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new study warns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Mount Sinai looked at the link between polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - found in everything from non-stick cookware to food packaging to tap water - and the incidence of type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-8b1482d0-6641-11f0-8a07-01233015b852"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which affects up to 35 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Past research has linked the chemicals, which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14313613/Microplastics-dementia-warning-particles-hidden-teabags-increase-risk-killer-disease.html"&gt;accumulate in the body over time and are slow to break down,&lt;/a&gt; to a range of health problems, including kidney, breast and testicular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To paint a more comprehensive picture of PFAS and diabetes risk, researchers looked at large population-level datasets to identify patterns of exposure and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on available data, the study analyzed 180 people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and compared them to 180 similar individuals without diabetes. All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used blood samples to analyze PFAS levels and found that higher levels increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by almost one third. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, each increase in range of PFAS exposure was linked to a 31 percent increase in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Vishal Midya, who was the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai, said: 'Because they don't break down easily, PFAS accumulate in the environment - and in human bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from Mount Sinai looked at the link between polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - found in everything from non-stick cookware to food packaging to tap water - and the incidence of type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study is one of the first to examine how these chemicals may disrupt the body's metabolism in ways that increase diabetes risk - particularly in diverse US populations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the researchers used data from BioMe, an electronic health record-linked biobank of more than 65,000 patients seeking primary care at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an initial analysis, 180 people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were selected with this group made up of 33 percent African Americans, 33 percent Hispanics, and 33 percent Whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients were then compared to 180 similar individuals without diabetes. All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood plasma samples collected from the individuals before they were diagnosed with diabetes or given the all-clear were used to assess PFAS levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then applied Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to the samples. This statistical method is used to analyze the effects of mixtures of chemical exposures on a health outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By using WQS, the team were able to see how PFAS levels in the blood were linked to patients developing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolic alterations, such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, are key contributors to the development of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes, often linked to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, disrupt the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively, leading to hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyperglycemia occurs when the level of sugar in your blood gets too high. Chronic or persistent hyperglycemia can lead to diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of hyperglycemia include feeling thirsty, frequent urination, tiredness and breath that smells fruity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for type 2 typically involves taking insulin several times a day, either by injection or through a pump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say the new findings underscore the importance of regulating PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author, Dr Damaskini Valvi, said: 'Findings can help us design more effective interventions for the early prevention of type 2 diabetes in the future, taking into account individuals' exposures to environmental chemicals along with other well-known genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors implicated in diabetes development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mounting research suggests that PFAS are a risk factor for several chronic diseases, such as obesity, liver disease, and diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public water systems have four years to implement solutions to reduce PFAS in their water, under orders made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beginning in 2029, the EPA will police levels of six types of PFAS in drinking water - PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpA, and PFBS - and systems with unacceptable levels, will be required to notify the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that US counties where drinking water surpassed this level - such as Nassau, Suffolk, and Rockland in New York and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e0-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, Orange, and Riverside counties in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e1-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - had a higher incidence of digestive, endocrine, respiratory, and mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increases in incidence rates ranged from slightly elevated, at two percent, to 'substantially elevated' at 33 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mount Sinai team are now calling for studies involving larger populations, expanding over the life course, in order to better understand the health impacts of PFAS across the lifespan and at vulnerable life periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;HONOLULU (Island News) – COVID-19 activity is yet again on the rise in Hawaii, according to the latest report from the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH’s newest data showed activity at a medium activity level, meaning the virus is circulating at higher levels than would be expected based on historic trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test positivity rate was reported to be 12.4% as of July 19, which is up from 10.9% from the previous week. According to officials, the 7-day average of new cases also rose on all islands over the last month through July 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increase reminds us that COVID-19 remains a health concern in the community. At the moment, COVID-19 is outpacing the flu and RSV in test positivity, emergency room visits and hospital admissions,” DOH stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH advises the public to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-3d6e4780-c743-4a74-a38e-43b05d92cb80" data-instance="#gallery-items-1c7a32d4-d866-44e6-98d0-5d3549d19c93-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-1c7a32d4-d866-44e6-98d0-5d3549d19c93"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Get the shot&lt;/strong&gt;: DOH encourages everyone age 6 months and older to get vaccinated during the current COVID-19 surge. DOH recommends the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine particularly for the following higher-risk populations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children age 6 months to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals age 2 years to 64 years who are immunocompromised (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval of 2 months; and may receive additional doses in discussion with their healthcare provider)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults age 65 years or older (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval 2 of months)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare workers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Stay home when sick&lt;/strong&gt;: Stay home if you’re feeling sick and return to usual activities only if fever-free for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medicines, and symptoms are improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Cover your cough&lt;/strong&gt;: Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze helps stop the spread of germs that make you and others sick. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands. Clean your hands after coughing or sneezing by washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Mask up&lt;/strong&gt;: Properly wearing a well-fitted mask when you have or are recovering from COVID-19 symptoms and are indoors with other people can help prevent spread of illness to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Get a test&lt;/strong&gt;: Take a COVID-19 test if you have symptoms and might need treatment because you are at higher risk for severe infection. Many respiratory viruses have similar symptoms, but treatments differ. Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 can prevent hospitalization and death. Treatment works best when taken as soon as possible after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/" target="_blank"&gt;View additional strategies on how to reduce COVID-19 and other respiratory disease spread, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The public is reminded to take reasonable precautions to avoid getting sick.

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Could frequent use of some cold and allergy medications, and many other common drugs, like those for anxiety, increase your risk of dementia?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore that question and why, as you age, you need to change what's in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are aware of it, but patients are most likely not. Certain over-the-counter and prescription medications could increase your risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We've known about the risk of memory, thinking disorders with these medications for decades,” said Tulane Neurologist Dr. Michele Longo, who has a special interest in memory disorders and sees patients at the UMC Healthy Brain Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medications fall into two classes:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First: Anticholinergic drugs, like some sleep aids and antihistamines like Benadryl, and prescriptions for overactive bladder, asthma, COPD, sleep aids, and motion sickness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second: benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They've been around for a long time. They are probably one of the more commonly prescribed medications,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that when you stop taking the benzos, memory issues tend to go back to normal, but strong anticholinergic drug use is consistently associated with an increased risk of dementia, even after you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons age makes a difference in the medication you take and how much of it you take is that as we get older, our systems slow down, allowing medications to stay in our bodies for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we have to reconsider, look at the medicines and say, ‘Alright, does the benefit of this medicine still outweigh the risks of that medicine?’ And that balance shifts as we age.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don't think that just because a drug is over-the-counter, it means there is no risk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that is marketed in the drug store to help with sleep. You know, I tell my patients to look for “PM.” If it says “PM,” we've got to look closely. Ask the pharmacist,” Dr. Longo recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, she says, bring a list of all the medications you take to your annual exam and let your doctor guide you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some doctors suggest that non-drowsy antihistamines, such as Claritin or Zyrtec, may be safer options for allergies, particularly for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

While HIV infection rates have remained fairly stable, syphilis shows the biggest increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 5 Americans live with such an infection at any given time, with health care costs estimated in the billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And with summer, rates tend to climb, which a &lt;a href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; using CDC data by Invigor Medical attributes to increased social activity, travel and sexual behavior when the weather’s warmer. But there are other factors, including varying levels of access to health care, different levels of sexual health education, differences in screening and its utilization and persistent social and economic factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Invigor Medical reports chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, with more than 1.6 million new cases in 2023, especially prominent among young women. Gonorrhea cases nearly doubled in the decade, to roughly 595,000. Syphilis increased sixfold from 34,279 cases to more than 205,000, though that may be a little misleading. Before 2018, the CDC didn’t include late-stage or unknown stage syphilis in its counts. Even so, the report said if you exclude those cases, the count still tripled over the decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s all bad news. The good news, per the report, is the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections may be slowing. Per the report, “While syphilis infections remain at record highs, reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV have declined from their peak levels in previous years, signaling a promising shift in the trajectory of the nation’s STD burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Men-vs.-women-and-infection-rates" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Men vs. women and infection rates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The analysis found that women are about 10% more likely to be diagnosed with an STD, compared to men. Among those 13 and older, there were 902 reported infections per 100,000 women, compared to 819 per 100,000 men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The gap is most pronounced for adolescents and young adults, per the report, which said that there are biological differences that make women more susceptible, but it could also be a case of doing a better job of counting. Women are more likely to be screened and screened younger during routine reproductive health visits. Men tend to be tested if they have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="State-by-state-count" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;State by state count&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The highest counts of STDs are currently found in the South, with Louisiana and Mississippi reporting the highest rates at 1,201.6 and 1,084.5 cases per 100,000, respectively. Two other states also report STD rates above 1,000 per 100,000: Alaska (1066.6) and Georgia (1020.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1450" data-height="1200"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=662" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1324 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt; Invigor Medical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The other Southern states in the top 10 are Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arkansas, while New York and South Dakota also make that top 10 list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;New England states typically have the lowest STD rates, per the report. Vermont (241). New Hampshire (251.1) and Maine (276.6) have one-fourth the infection rate of those in the highest burden states. “New England states tend to be older and have less ethnic diversity, both of which are associated with lower STD risk,” per Invigor Medical. The region also tends to have higher median income and a lower uninsured rate, so it’s easier to get tested and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Filling out the bottom 10, Oregon ranks No. 41, Connecticut, No. 42 and Montana No. 43. Utah ranks No. 44 for states with highest rates of sexually transmitted disease, then Wyoming (No. 45), Idaho (No. 46), and West Virginia (No. 47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Utah-STD-numbers" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Utah STD numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2023, Utah had 429.6 newly reported STD cases per 100,000 residents, making it seventh-best in terms of having low STD rates. Nationally, there were 746.7 cases per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of those cases in Utah, chlamydia accounted for 11,004, for a rate of 322 per 100,000, making its chlamydia rate seventh-lowest in the U.S. The national chlamydia rate was 492.2 per 100,000 with 1,648,568 new cases total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There were 77.9 new gonorrhea cases in Utah per 100,000 residents, eighth-lowest. In all, there were 2,664 new cases. Nationally, the 601,319 cases created a rate of 179.5 cases per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was sixth-lowest for syphilis, with a rate of 24.2 cases per 100,000 residents and 828 total cases. Nationally, the numbers were 205,371 cases and a rate of 61.3 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was 12th lowest for HIV, with 153 new cases, which came out to 5.5 cases per 100,000 residents. In the U.S. overall, the 38,793 cases reported created a rate of 13.7 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report includes 354 U.S. metro areas and all 50 states.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) is confirming a case of brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of Naegleria fowleri--the scientific term for the amoeba--was identified the week of July 7th but the agency hasn't said where in the state it was found.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 started looking into these claims after reports circulated in local Facebook groups suggesting a child in the Midlands may have died from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 reached out to the Centers for Disease Control, local hospitals, several coroner's offices, and the state's environmental department, but no one could confirm a death or a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCDPH did confirm the case but said it's not required to be reported to their agency. "The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person's condition," SCDPH officials clarified in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The agency stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the amoeba are naturally occurring, there is no way to prevent them in lakes or rivers. The amoeba is only life-threatening if it goes up the nose and to the brain. It is not delay if ingested through the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says early symptoms of the amoeba infection include fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Those cases usually progress rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health has criminalized nitazenes, a class of synthetic opioids that can be even stronger than fentanyl, as overdose deaths in the state mount.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes are temporarily labeled a Class I controlled substance as of Saturday, meaning it’s illegal to possess, distribute or manufacture them in the state. The action puts Pennsylvania in line with federal policy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim label can last up to two years. In its announcement, the Department of Health said it’s taking steps to place nitazenes in Class I permanently.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scheduling nitazenes, which have no acceptable medical use, as Class I substances provides law enforcement with the authority to crack down on its possession and distribution in Pennsylvania,” said Secretary of Health Debra Bogen. “Meanwhile, our focus remains on developing strategies that help connect people with substance use disorder with treatment and other resources.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes were first developed in the 1950s as an alternative to morphine, but were never approved for medical use. They were an obscure domain of pharmacological researchers until spilling into the illicit drug market in 2019.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes have continued to become more prevalent in the state’s illicit drug supply, according to the department, contributing to 45 deaths in Pennsylvania since 2023.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioids remain the leading cause of fatal overdoses in the state and across the country. In 2023, 3,757 Pennsylvanians died of an overdose involving opioids, 3,470 of which were at least partly attributed to fentanyl.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other opioids, overdose reversal medications such as Narcan should be administered in cases of nitazene overdose.

&lt;/p&gt;

Analyzing data from over 3 million individuals, researchers found that while heredity increases risk, most diagnosed individuals do not have affected relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges stigma and clarifies that mental disorders arise from complex genetic and environmental factors. The findings highlight the need for both personalized and population-level approaches to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family History Rare:&lt;/strong&gt; 89% of people with schizophrenia have no close relative with the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Causes:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental illness stems from many small genetic variations plus environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Even with family history, most people never develop a mental disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;strong&gt;t is a common belief that mental illness ‘runs in families’. And while it is true that heredity plays a role, in reality, the vast majority of cases – such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and borderline personality disorder – occur in people without any known hereditary predisposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a major new study by researchers at the Danish Center for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University, recently published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111838"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a tree." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;So while the study supports that heredity is a factor, it also makes clear that heredity is unpredictable and complex, he adds: Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is based on data from over 3 million Danes, and the researchers hope it will help alleviate concerns and reduce stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, people are most worried about what they see among close relatives. Very few go around fearing they’ll develop schizophrenia unless they have a relative with the condition. But this study clearly shows that all of us have a risk of developing mental illness,” says Professor Carsten Bøcker Pedersen, who co-authored the study with Professor Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eighty-nine percent of people diagnosed with schizophrenia have no history of the disorder among close relatives. So it’s far from something that only occurs in affected families,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern is seen with depression: 60% of individuals who experience depression have no relatives with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does my mother’s illness mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises an important question: If most mental illnesses occur in people without a relative with the same condition, how do they arise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers can’t give a precise answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mental disorders are hereditary, but they are also highly polygenic. They often result from many small genetic variations, not a single ‘disease gene.’ Additionally, environment and chance also play a role,” explains Professor Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the study is groundbreaking because it describes the absolute risk – how many out of 100 people will develop a specific mental disorder in their lifetime. This functions like an atlas, helping individuals understand, for example, the statistical implication of having a mother with a mental illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope the data can help nuance the narrative for families affected by highly heritable conditions like schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your father or sister has schizophrenia, it does not mean you will necessarily develop it. In fact, the study shows that 92% of people with a first-degree relative with schizophrenia do not develop the disorder themselves,” says Carsten Bøcker Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the study supports that heredity is a factor, it also makes clear that heredity is unpredictable and complex, he adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a parent or sibling who has had depression, your risk of developing depression is around 15% – while your risk is under 5% if you have no close relatives with the condition. But that also means you still have an 85% chance of not developing the illness, even if it appears in your immediate family. That’s an important message.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Digging into old church records&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used Danish national registries to link individuals and their mental health diagnoses across generations. The study draws on the Civil Registration System, the Multigeneration Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the National Patient Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone diagnosed in psychiatric care between January 1970 and December 2021 is included in the study – but all data is pseudonymized, meaning that researchers never accessed personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carsten Bøcker Pedersen and Esben Agerbo are key figures behind the Multigeneration Register, which they are developing in collaboration with the Danish National Archives. The register links family relationship data from the Civil Registration System with historical information from church records, tracing Danish family links back to 1920.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Multigeneration Register provides a powerful foundation for further studies on how heredity and family structure influence health in Denmark – such as the development of mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study points to the need for a dual-track approach to addressing mental illness. One track involves personalized medicine, considering individual genetics and environment. The other involves population-wide measures, such as reducing societal stressors, lowering alcohol consumption, and promoting mental well-being,” says Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both are essential if we are to prevent and understand mental illness – in both individuals with mentally ill relatives and the majority for whom the illness arises without a family history,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About the research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study is a prospective cohort study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigated disorders: substance abuse, cannabis abuse, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia and related disorders, schizoaffective psychosis, affective disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, personality disorders, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborators: Danish National Archives, University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University Hospital&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;External funding: Novo Nordisk Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afd9c6cdcac1efceda81cbc4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vibe Noordeloos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://au.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Vibe Noordeloos – Aarhus University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00196-8/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Absolute and relative risks of mental disorders in families: a Danish register-based study”&lt;/a&gt; by Carsten Bøcker Pedersen et al. &lt;em&gt;LancetPsychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute and relative risks of mental disorders in families: a Danish register-based study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative risk estimates of familial aggregation of many types of mental disorders are available, but absolute risk estimates of familial aggregation of mental disorders remain sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of individuals who develop a mental disorder in the absence of the same disorder in a relative (non-familial cases) has not been examined. We aimed to create comprehensive risk estimates of the familial aggregation of mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this prospective cohort study, we followed people of Danish origin between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 2021. We used Danish population-based registers to link individuals and their mental health across extended family pedigrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These registers include the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Multi Generation Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the Danish National Patient Register. Mental disorders investigated were substance use disorder, cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia and related disorders, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorders, bipolar disorder, single and recurrent depressive disorders (depression), personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated lifetime risk (risk up to age 60 years), age-specific absolute risk, and relative risk for each mental disorder and type of affected relative (eg first, second, or third-degree relatives). We calculated heritability estimates and the proportion of non-familial cases. We involved people with related lived experience in the study design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 3 048 583 individuals (1 486 132 [48·75%] females and 1 562 451 [51·25%] males) were followed up for 80 425 971 person-years. Individuals with a family member with a specific type of mental disorder had higher lifetime and relative risks of developing the same type of mental disorder. Both lifetime and relative risks were higher the closer the affected kinship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the lifetime risk of depression was 15·48% (95% CI 15·31–15·65) in individuals with affected first-degree relatives, 13·50% (13·25–13·75) in individuals with affected second-degree relatives, 7·80% (7·76–7·84) in the general population, and 4·68% (4·65–4·71) in individuals without affected first-degree and second-degree relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heritability for depression was 45·4% (95% CI 44·8–46·0) and the proportion of non-familial cases constituted 60·0% (95% CI 59·8–60·2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with family members with a mental disorder face increased risks of the same disorder. From a population perspective, most mental disorders occur in individuals without affected close relatives, thus highlighting the need for prevention strategies which target the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Translation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Danish translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:25:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE52MWQxOHpheHp6a2VRUjJlel9MdnVKcC1wcHJMU3pPZ2VvRVM3eWEtR19POExaQVhYcXo0MGxESlQ3dGlxTk1wZEZkTDdYR28yLW9uV3loeVBabkNhWGxwb2plM0l0d1FQRXJpQnAwaW4yQUE</guid></item><item><title>这位女士在了解了“肌肉跨度”后逆转了她的脂肪肝和糖尿病前期-以下是需要知道的-女性健康 | This Woman Reversed Her Fatty Liver And Prediabetes After She Learned About 'Musclespan'—Here's What To Know - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4zeDhIck9uOFlNREdxdHlxbHgyNzRDZHUxc0p5eFBGTnNaM3N2YTJfQjVfZDctalZwNFE1S19GVDFEQnV1TG5PZEp3MHRWOTYySC1xOFJMTUU3VThNOFJiVjhaZzR4RGFIM2N6Vk5zUGZKa3h5a2lhSUt5MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.0"&gt;Maria Arellano Simpson &lt;/strong&gt;has been on and off restrictive diets since she was 9 years old. “As a young adult growing up in the 2000s, cardio was the focus, and I spent hours doing it to try and get smaller,” says Arellano Simpson, now 44. She logged hours on the stair-stepper and miles on the pavement. It worked, to some degree, providing her a small calorie deficit but no additional muscle or strength. Then, when she had her daughter 12 years ago, she quickly put on 100 pounds, was diagnosed as prediabetic, developed a fatty liver, and registered a body fat percentage in the 50s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fast-forward to last year and her wake-up call, which came in the form of two sick relatives. “I felt like I owed it to my kids to have the best possible health, and I didn’t want them to have to take care of me when I get older,” she says. She began her quest to preserve both her wellness and lifespan. And that, in turn, led her straight to the concept of musclespan—though she didn’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Newly in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65243267/perimenopause-young-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65243267/perimenopause-young-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;, Arellano Simpson was researching how to stay healthy during the transition, so she was aware of the benefits of strength training and muscle in general. Then the social media algorithm started serving her content highlighting muscle and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One day, while scrolling TikTok, she came across a strong and athletic trainer from the fitness app &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65172928/peloton-jennifer-jacobs-joining-ladder/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65172928/peloton-jennifer-jacobs-joining-ladder/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ladder" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt; who was celebrating muscle and strength. “I remember thinking, &lt;em data-node-id="4.3"&gt;I want to be able to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="4.4"&gt;move and lift like that&lt;/em&gt;,” she recalls. Another post that caught her attention was from a female bodybuilder in her 80s. “She was lifting weights, running, just full of life,” Arellano Simpson says. That’s when “chasing muscle instead of thinness” became her new objective. “All the tools fell into my lap at the right time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Arellano Simpson, who runs a photography studio in Houston, focusing on muscle shifted her mentality from “I need to lose weight” to “I need to put on as much muscle as possible.” Losing 100 pounds was daunting. Gaining muscle and eating well (and enough)? “A quest worth pursuing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After nine months of focusing on muscle, she reversed her fatty liver and prediabetes. Her quality of life drastically improved too: She plays with her daughters at the park and climbs flights of stairs with ease, and her chronic back and knee pain are nearly nonexistent. “Muscle gives you freedom,” she says. “I know people need to hear about this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-musclespan-means" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What Musclespan Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You’ve probably heard the terms &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;lifespan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em data-node-id="8.3"&gt;healthspan&lt;/em&gt;. The former signifies how long you live, while the latter refers to how long you’re in good health. “But musclespan is the way in which we support strength and healthy aging,” says physician and &lt;em data-node-id="8.5"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt; advisor &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45381895/dr-gabrielle-lyon-forever-strong-book-excerpt/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45381895/dr-gabrielle-lyon-forever-strong-book-excerpt/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gabrielle Lyon, DO" data-node-id="8.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Gabrielle Lyon, DO&lt;/a&gt;, who coined the term and has spent years studying how protein and muscle impact aging, performance, and disease prevention. “It’s about living as long as you can with healthy skeletal muscle.” (Skeletal muscle is the muscle attached to bones, as opposed to cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, located around organs. The more you know!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As a perioperative medicine physician at Stanford Medicine, &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/k/sarita-khemani.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/k/sarita-khemani.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sarita Khemani, MD" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sarita Khemani, MD&lt;/a&gt;, often sees patients who are admitted to the hospital after a hip fracture or brain bleed due to a fall that may have been caused, in part, by weak muscles. Having muscle “in reserve” (meaning you built it up earlier in life) that can act as your armor helps you better handle the inevitable injury, surgery, or illness, says Dr. Khemani. That preparation becomes even more important as we age and face unexpected curveballs. “It’s not if, but when, illness strikes, because it happens to all of us,” Dr. Lyon says. “If you are prepared with both strength and mass, then you are much more likely to be able to overcome life’s challenges.” That is musclespan in a nutshell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So, no matter your fitness goals, if you’re interested in extending the healthy and vibrant years ahead, this is an approach that can benefit you. “The data supports that you’re never too old—and also never too young—to improve muscle health,” Dr. Lyon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="musclespan" title="musclespan" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;James Macari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-science-to-back-it" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;The Science to Back It &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Lyon argues that musclespan not only trumps healthspan but also dictates both healthspan and lifespan. “Muscle is  the key because it is a metabolic and endocrine organ,” she says, citing recent research that links low skeletal muscle mass to an increased risk of all-cause mortality. It’s not just an aesthetic or functional enabler; muscle health is also related to insulin sensitivity, metabolic health, and the ability to withstand illness or injury, Dr. Lyon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In fact, emerging science around myokines—hormone-like compounds released by contracting skeletal muscle fibers—shows they play a powerful role in regulating inflammation, protecting against chronic disease, and promoting longevity. “Of course, longevity is multifactorial,” Dr. Lyon notes. (Cardiovascular fitness, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body composition" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;body composition&lt;/a&gt;, and other markers also matter.) “But muscle health, strength, and mass have emerged as some of the most robust predictors of healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While it’s common for people to measure everything from their blood pressure and cholesterol to daily steps, very few measure and track their strength or muscle mass. And muscle isn’t often thought of as an organ in and of itself that deserves as much care as its higher-profile counterparts. “We focus on other organs, like the heart and brain, which are very important. But muscle is a critical organ, especially when it comes to longevity,” adds Dr. Khemani. In short, tracking musclespan the way you do other mainstream health markers is a smart move—and easier than you might think (see “How to Measure Your Musclespan” coming up). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-muscle-tells-you-more" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why Muscle Tells You More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;How is it that muscle is so protective? Those myokines may be the reason exercise decreases the risk of chronic disease, including cancer, cardiovascular illness, and neurodegeneration, according to a review in &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Endocrine Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. “These powerful messengers allow muscle to ‘talk’ to other organs, including the brain, adipose tissue, liver, and immune system, helping regulate vital processes like blood sugar control, metabolism, mood, and brain health,” Dr. Khemani explains. “Because of this, muscle is deeply connected to metabolic health, cognitive function, longevity, and disease resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If peak musclespan is at one end of the spectrum, sarcopenia—a disease characterized by a decline in muscle mass and function—is at the other. It’s often thought of as a disease of aging, but it actually affects more than 10 percent of adults in their 20s and 30s, per a recent review in &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;All of this is to say: “Maintaining muscle isn’t optional,” Dr. Khemani says. “Healthy muscle is one of the most powerful predictors of how long and how well one will live.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-apply-it-to-life" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;How to Apply It to Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A well-known truth: “The more active you are, the more you prime your body for muscle,” Dr. Lyon says. This means avoiding sedentary stretches outside of your regularly scheduled exercise programming. “One reason muscle becomes unhealthy is there’s no flux,” she explains. “It’s like a pond that becomes a swamp because nothing is moving.” In an ideal world, you’d get up and move at least every 30 minutes or so, says &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65367168/longevitylist/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65367168/longevitylist/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Heather Milton" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Heather Milton&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone’s Sports Performance Center.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Activity may prime the body for muscle, but resistance training builds it. “There’s no replacement for resistance training because [it changes the] muscle fibers,” Dr. Lyon says. As you age, this becomes especially important, since fast-twitch muscle fibers—the ones responsible for strength and explosive movement—naturally shrink. “They decrease in size and number, so you see people go from being buff to being skinny and sarcopenic,” she says. “You have to make sure you’re maintaining fast-twitch fibers through strength and power training.” She personally combines strength and power work in one session by integrating moves that require power—like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g25058598/medicine-ball-exercise/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g25058598/medicine-ball-exercise/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="medicine ball slams" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;medicine ball slams&lt;/a&gt;—into her strength workouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="24" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“Healthy muscle is one of the most powerful predictors of how long and how well one will live.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training twice a week is the recommended minimum, says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19036/deborah-kwolek" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19036/deborah-kwolek" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deborah Gomez Kwolek, MD" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Deborah Gomez Kwolek, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the founding lead of the Mass General Women’s Health and Sex and Gender Medicine Program. You can start small, using dumbbells at home, and work your way up to three or four sessions a week. Arellano Simpson is a good case study: She began with 15-minute strength training workouts on the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g21971119/best-workout-apps-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g21971119/best-workout-apps-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ladder app" data-node-id="25.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ladder app&lt;/a&gt;. Now she does two lower-body workouts and two upper-body workouts through the app every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;No matter how often you train, you want to target all major muscle groups—chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms, and core—and lift enough weight to put sufficient stress on the muscles so that they have to adapt. “Choose a weight that, by the last repetition, you could probably do only about one or two more times before failure, or before your form breaks,” Milton says. She suggests training primarily in a hypertrophy (or muscle growth) rep range, which is three to six sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of an exercise. Perhaps most important: Continually challenge yourself in new ways through progressive stimulus—increasing the intensity, volume, and/or complexity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And you can’t skip taking a protein-first approach to nutrition. Dr. Lyon recommends that women consume 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of target body weight, but no less than 100 grams per day; the older and more active you are, the more you need. Once protein needs are met, she adds, most metabolically healthy people can then divvy up the rest of their daily calories between carbs and fats as they like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Okay, you may feel as if you have a lot of homework now! But the flip side of &lt;em data-node-id="29.1"&gt;allll&lt;/em&gt; of these tasks is recovery. It’s critical to nail the right work-to-rest ratio so your muscles have enough time to recover, adapt, and become healthier, Milton says. “If you are doing higher-intensity exercise or lifting for the same muscle groups every day, your system doesn’t have a chance to repair that tissue,” she says. Strength training causes microscopic tears to the muscles, which require at least 48 hours to repair and come back stronger. That’s why sleep is imperative: “When we sleep, the hormones that create those adaptations are at their peak,” Milton says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Musclespan isn’t built in a day—but with strategic training, enough protein, and real rest, you can create a body with built-in armor. As Dr. Khemani puts it: If you want to stay active, independent, and mentally sharp, “muscle is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-measure-your-musclespan" data-node-id="31" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;How to Measure Your Musclespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="32.0"&gt;If you can do more than one of these tests, you’ll paint a holistic picture of your muscle health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="33" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0.0"&gt;Train three functional movement patterns. &lt;/strong&gt;“I believe everyone should be able to do a push-up, a pull-up, and a good bodyweight squat,” Dr. Lyon says. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65371604/push-up-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65371604/push-up-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Push-ups" data-node-id="33.0.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Push-ups&lt;/a&gt; in particular are a barometer of muscle­span over time, says Milton. She points to a study that found that men who could do 40 push-ups had a lower risk of morbidity and death than those who could do only 10. (Women would likely see similar benefits with fewer reps, though a comparable study hasn’t been done yet, Milton says.) Dr. Lyon recommends performing a self-assessment using these three moves—how many can you do with good form?—aiming for 10 push-ups, 1 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64702069/how-to-do-a-pull-up-training-plan-pdf/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64702069/how-to-do-a-pull-up-training-plan-pdf/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="unassisted pull-up" data-node-id="33.0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;unassisted pull-up&lt;/a&gt;, and 25-plus squats as a benchmark. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Test your grip strength. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to being a “fundamental metric” when it comes to muscle function and overall physical capacity, grip strength was proposed as a “new vital sign of health” in a recent review in the &lt;em data-node-id="33.1.2"&gt;Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. “Grip strength is an easy test that can be done on most populations without injury risk, and it has strong correlations to overall function and strength,” Milton says. You can find &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64555515/grip-strength-longevity/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64555515/grip-strength-longevity/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="grip strength testers" data-node-id="33.1.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;grip strength testers&lt;/a&gt;—called dynamometers—on Amazon. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.2.0"&gt;Know your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="VO2 max" data-node-id="33.2.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.0.1.1"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This metric tells you how much oxygen you use during exercise. “In the clinical world, we use aerobic capacity to measure your risk for early morbidity and mortality,” says Milton. It’s measured while you’re engaged in cardio, but muscle mass is one of the main components determining your number. “Muscle is the tissue with the mitochondria that utilize oxygen to produce ATP—which is the molecule needed for contraction,” she explains. Ensuring your VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.2"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max falls within a healthy range for your age and gender (look for charts online) can also provide insight into your overall muscle health. You can get a VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.4"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max test at a lab (give it a Google for locations near you) or use a wearable, like an Apple Watch or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40471424/oura-ring-gen-3-review/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40471424/oura-ring-gen-3-review/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oura Ring" data-node-id="33.2.6" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt;, for a general idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Have blood work done. &lt;/strong&gt;Remember how muscle helps regulate metabolism? Well, looking at the blood markers related to metabolic syndrome—like triglycerides, insulin, and glucose—can be a clue to your muscular health. “All of those are indicators of metabolic syndrome, which is [in actuality] unhealthy skeletal muscle,” Dr. Lyon says. She recommends having blood work performed quarterly to check your numbers. While most of the tests can be ordered by a primary care provider during a routine physical, insulin isn’t always included, she notes, so ask for a fasting insulin test specifically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.0"&gt;Consider a scan. &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65037382/bone-health-trend-dexa/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65037382/bone-health-trend-dexa/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DEXA scan" data-node-id="33.4.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;DEXA scan&lt;/a&gt; is a type of X-ray exam that uses a small amount of radiation to look at your bone density.

                                &lt;p&gt;More than 40% of U.S. adults are considered obese. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors and health experts say there are different types of fat. Some are more dangerous than others, so it's important to know what type you're carrying around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subcutaneous fat is the type just beneath the skin that you can pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the more dangerous kind, visceral fat, is buried deep within the abdomen. It's typically stored around your belly and can wrap itself around your organs, trigger inflammation, and contribute to several health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visceral fat has shown to increase all major chronic diseases," said Julia Zumpano, registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of that deep belly fat can help you be healthier, and experts say being active is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're sitting at a desk all day and we're only doing 30 minutes of exercise, but we're doing it every day, it's still really not enough for most people," Zumpano explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say work movement into your daily life. Trying a walking desk, taking breaks to go for a walk, doing squats at your desk, wearing a weighted vest, taking the stairs, or parking further away all can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key? A healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Belly fat can be increased by artificial and sugary foods," said Zumpano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, be sure to steer away from sweets and toward whole foods, like lean sources of protein and fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plant-based diets, Mediterranean diets, have been shown to be very helpful when it comes to reducing inflammation and visceral fat," Zumpano added.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s something that will make you lose just a bit more faith in humanity—or at least reach for some hand wipes. New research shows that even in hospitals, a substantial number of people aren’t bothering to wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Surrey in England led the study, installing sensors near hospital toilet and sink pipes to keep track of people’s handwashing. Nearly half of toilet users skipped the sink after flushing, they found. The researchers say more effective strategies are needed to remind and convince people of the importance of handwashing, particularly in high-risk environments like hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have tried to analyze how rigorous people are about handwashing in hospitals and other settings, but they’ve been limited. Some have relied on asking people to self-report their hygiene habits, for instance, which &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136445"&gt;might incentivize&lt;/a&gt; more than a few to fudge the truth. The researchers decided to take a different approach. They connected sensors to toilet and sink pipes that could objectively and non-intrusively detect if and when they were being used. The sensors work by measuring the temperature in the pipes and nearby air; when either cold or hot water passes through the pipes, the temperature sharply changes relative to its surroundings, indicating use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers teamed up with the Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark to conduct their study (aptly named the “FLUSH. WASH. PROTECT.” study). For 19 weeks, they tracked people’s handwashing behaviors at two public restrooms in the hospital, ultimately recording more than 2,600 flushes. Nearly 44% of the time after flushing, people steered clear of handwashing. At times, non-adherence was even worse, with over 60% of people not handwashing during certain weeks. Non-handwashing was also more common at the start and end of the day and during typical meal times. The team &lt;a href="https://osf.io/befvt"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its findings last week on the Open Source Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“People may assume handwashing is second nature by now—especially in hospitals and post-covid-19—but our data paints a different picture,” said lead author Pablo Pereira-Doel, co-leader of the Human Insight Lab at the University of Surrey’s Business School, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091556"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low rates of handwashing can, of course, make it easier for doctors, patients, and visitors to inadvertently spread dangerous infections to already vulnerable people, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;drug-resistant superbugs.&lt;/a&gt; Some studies have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483670/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that certain interventions, like clear signs, can modestly boost handwashing at hospitals, at least temporarily. But given the results here, it’s likely we’ll need to do a lot more to consistently improve people’s hand hygiene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings are worrying but not surprising. Even simple behaviors like handwashing can lapse without reinforcement. In hospitals, lapses like these can have serious consequences—for patients and for the wider healthcare system. It’s time we moved beyond posters and hand gel stations to more effective behavioral strategies,” said study author Carrie Newlands, Lead for Clinical Skills at the University of Surrey’s School of Medicine, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I wouldn’t blame you (or myself) for avoiding the standard handshake more often. And just in case anyone needs it, here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html"&gt;proper technique&lt;/a&gt; for handwashing, courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking just slightly faster helps older people stay active for longer, and stave off frailty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking just 14 steps per minute more than their usual pace led to “meaningful” improvements in physical well-being for seniors who were frail or at risk of becoming frail, according to new findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team explained that frailty is a medically defined condition in older people that increases vulnerability to everyday stresses, leading to a higher risk of falls, hospitalization, and loss of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning signs of frailty include 1) unintentional weight loss, 2) moving slowly, 3) feeling weak, 4) persistent tiredness and 5) low levels of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of these signs have a direct link to how active someone is, scientists say walking is a particularly effective way for older people to improve their overall health and quality of life, and maintain their independence longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the question had remained until now: how fast do they need to walk to see real benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the “talk test” has been used to guide walking intensity where people are encouraged to walk at a pace that makes it difficult to sing but still allows for comfortable conversation. But this method is subjective and difficult to apply consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine, found that cadence—the number of steps per minute—may be the key, and the researchers developed a smartphone app designed to accurately measure walking pace, making it easier to integrate the beneficial practice into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALK FOR YOUR BACK&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Millions Who Suffer Back Pain Can Ease Symptoms Simply by Walking More–For ‘Huge Benefits’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/millions-who-suffer-back-pain-can-ease-symptoms-simply-by-walking-more-for-huge-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Millions Who Suffer Back Pain Can Ease Symptoms Simply by Walking More–For ‘Huge Benefits’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anesthesiologist Dr. Daniel Rubin became interested in walking cadence during his clinical experience evaluating older patients preparing for surgery, because they have a higher risk of complications associated with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, surgical teams have relied on physical function questionnaires to risk-stratify patients, but I thought there must be a way to develop more objective metrics,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/health-and-wellness-articles/walking-slightly-faster-could-help-older-adults-stay-fit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a media release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rubin and his colleagues studied older adults classified as either frail or pre-frail. The participants with an average age of 69 were enrolled in structured walking programs within their retirement communities, guided and assessed by clinical research staff. Cadence was measured by a device fitted to their thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was encouraged to walk “as fast as safely possible” while another group walked at their usual comfortable pace. The results,&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; published in the journal PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, showed “clear” benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shoot for 100 steps per minute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who increased their cadence to around 100 steps per minute—14 steps per minute above their usual pace—experienced “substantial” improvements in their functional capacity (demonstrated by their ability to walk longer distances in a standardized test).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People who haven’t experienced frailty can’t imagine how big a difference it makes to be able to not get tired going to the grocery store or not need to sit down while they’re out,” Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on those findings, Rubin’s team created a smartphone app, called Walk Test, which they designed specifically for measuring walking cadence accurately because they didn’t necessarily trust the built-in trackers in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, which is not yet available publicly, uses a novel open-source method to analyze the data measured by the phone. Validation testing showed the app counts steps-per-minute with “exceptional” accuracy, closely matching specialized, research-grade accelerometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But right now, people can easily maintain the beneficial cadence of 100 steps per minute by using a metronome app—or simply&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFx5Fgnrldw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; play an audio of a metronome at 100 beats per minute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even casual walking had positive effects on our study participants, but for those who are able, increasing their walking pace judiciously can yield even greater results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Photographs have been circulating online for years that supposedly depict where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet. In the photographs, there is a clearly visible line between the two, and the water on each side of the line is a different color. This has led to online speculation that the two oceans actually don't mix at all. But is that really the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet off the southernmost tip of South America, between that continent and Antarctica. Prior to the Panama Canal, this was the passage most ships took to get from one ocean to the other since the passage to the north, through Canada, had too much hazardous ice. Islands litter this area of water, and it is here that the oceans not only meet, but also mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Much of our oceans are still a big mystery to us due to the challenges of oceanic exploration. The Atlantic Ocean cooling at a record speed, the long-term effects of glaciers melting, and even the type of sea life found in the great trenches are all mysteries to study. Despite the challenges, ocean science has been able to monitor where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet, mix, and what factors contribute to how fast they merge together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;David Merron Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are a few factors that influence the speed at which the two oceans mix. The Pacific Ocean is less salty than the Atlantic Ocean, which prevents them from mixing smoothly. The water between the islands off South America tends to be slower, which reduces the speed of the oceans mixing. However, the waters closer to Antarctica are rougher and the waves bigger, which actually speeds up the process further south. The two oceans will also blend together on the seafloor, where the daily changes of the tides influence their speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Climate change is having an effect on the rate at which the oceans mix. Human pollution has had a detrimental impact on the waters of the planet. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such impact that is clearly visible. Although a plastic-eating fungus is naturally helping to clean it up, it's not able to do so faster than we can pollute. Climate change has resulted in melting ice in Antarctica, which alters the density of the water and thus slows the rate at which the oceans mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since the oceans actually do mix, why do we see two distinct colors where they meet? The most likely cause is the waters of two different temperatures coming together. The colder water around Antarctica meets up with the warmer water from the north, and there is a visible contrast when they come together. The saltier water of the Atlantic Ocean may also be a contributory factor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These days, if people online don't believe a photo is real, they assume it is created by AI. Given the increasingly realistic nature of AI images, it can be hard to tell what is real and what isn't — especially with new technology that will use AI to turn memories into photos. However, even before AI was everywhere, photos posted online could still be confusing and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A photo taken in 2007 that circulated around for years appeared to depict a permanent line in the water where two oceans met but never mixed. The photo — factchecked &lt;a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/two-oceans-meet/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by Snopes — was reportedly posted by University of California-Santa Cruz professor of ocean sciences, Ken Bruland, during his research in the Gulf of Alaska. It caused a great deal of speculation online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What was seen was actually water with heavy sediment from glacial rivers meeting up with the ocean. This caused a difference in color and slowed down the waters blending together. It was not a permanent line, and the waters did eventually mix. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

But why should you pay attention to these specific types of foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is one of our most important organs for our overall health—so taking care of it should be a top priority, according to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1407112998" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Leah Kaufman&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian at NYU Langone Health. “The liver has many functions, but one of which is to eliminate wasteful substances from the body in the form of bile,” Kaufman says. “Therefore, it is important to keep your liver healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unhealthy liver can cause more health problems in the long run, so there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when taking care of it. She recommends &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-happens-when-you-stop-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;avoiding excess alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, high fatty foods, and simple sugars as the best way to keep your liver clean and functioning well. You’ll also want to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/brain-health-exercises" target="_blank"&gt;exercise regularly&lt;/a&gt; and pick healthy foods. Here are Kaufman's picks for the best, liver-friendly foods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman recommends including a variety of foods filled with antioxidants into your diet to help cleanse the liver and decrease toxins. Studies show that foods like blueberries are not only rich with antioxidants to protect the liver from free radicals, but they also have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616313851?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616313851?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;inhibit the growth of cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leafy Greens and Cruciferous Veggies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are another food that is rich in antioxidant properties, says Kaufman. Foods like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kale-juice" target="_blank"&gt;Kale&lt;/a&gt;, cabbage, and arugula are also great sources of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chlorophyll-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;, which is a natural compound that is known for its &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384064/" target="_blank"&gt;detox properties&lt;/a&gt; and ability to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384064/" target="_blank"&gt;enhance liver function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous veggies, which include broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, are also known to boost liver health and protect the liver cells. A study done on mice shows that broccoli played a major role in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27672403/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing the risk of fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are another food that Kaufman said is rich in antioxidants to protect the liver from free radicals and help it cleanse out impurities from the body. Studies also show that tomatoes can help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6308920/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of fatty liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis, scarring of the liver, or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman also recommends beets as an antioxidant-rich food you can turn to for your liver. Studies show that beet juice can protect the liver from &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free radical damage&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress. It can also &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the fat&lt;/a&gt; that might grow around the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From lowering cholesterol to lowering the risk of certain diseases, flaxseeds come with loads of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/flaxseeds" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Kaufman likes the food for your liver as it is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which studies show can help &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1098882324000327" target="_blank"&gt;reduce fat&lt;/a&gt; that may grow around the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon and Other Fatty Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another food rich in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/omega-3-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; is fatty fish, which include salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and tuna. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3257651/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Kaufman agrees and especially recommends salmon for the liver. Known as the ultimate anti-aging beauty food (and a favorite amongst &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-eats-this-collagen-stimulating-food-every-day#:~:text=Salmon%20is%20rich%20in%20DHA,and%20reducing%20inflammation%20and%20cholesterol." target="_blank"&gt;many celebs&lt;/a&gt;), salmon is known to be good for your brain and gut health while also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5019889/" target="_blank"&gt;lowering liver fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need more reason to justify your daily cup of joe, studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/when-is-the-right-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;drinking coffee&lt;/a&gt; can help prevent many different types of liver diseases. One study done in 2016 shows that coffee can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4862107/" target="_blank"&gt;lower the risk of fatty liver disease,&lt;/a&gt; and another study done in the same year shows that drinking two cups of coffee may help &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26806124/" target="_blank"&gt;protect from permanent liver damage&lt;/a&gt; if you’re already dealing with chronic liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Olive Oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-cooking-oil" target="_blank"&gt;best cooking oils,&lt;/a&gt; and you can even &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olive-oil-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;drink it daily.&lt;/a&gt; Olive oil is a powerhouse and comes with many health benefits, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olive-oil-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; fighting diabetes, boosting heart and gut health, strengthening bones, and reducing high blood pressure. As for the liver, studies show that olive oil can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29141573/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce inflammation and fat around the liver&lt;/a&gt; and lower elevated liver enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Garlic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of adding flavor to any dish, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-health-benefits-of-wild-garlic-detoxifying-spring-herb" target="_blank"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; is packed with minerals, sulfur compounds, vitamins A and C, and fiber to promote health and prevent disease. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-health-benefits-of-wild-garlic-detoxifying-spring-herb" target="_blank"&gt;It is known&lt;/a&gt; to boost your immunity, protect against inflammation, may protect against certain cancers, and lower blood pressure. It also makes for one of the best liver detox foods out there. Studies show that garlic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354004/" target="_blank"&gt;can help reduce fat&lt;/a&gt; around the organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354004/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk of liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citrus Fruits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you drink orange juice daily as part of your breakfast meal or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/5-reasons-why-lemon-water-is-the-perfect-start-to-your-day" target="_blank"&gt;drink water with lemon&lt;/a&gt;, citrus fruits are great for flushing out toxins in your liver. Studies show that drinking orange juice daily can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39339791/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce your risk of fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts such as walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-nuts-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;so much nutritional value&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll find antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fiber-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin E, and healthy fats to name just a few), and they make for a great snack option or added garnish to a meal. Some &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-nuts-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; include maintaining or lowering cholesterol levels, reducing inflammation, and helping us maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your liver, preliminary studies show that nuts &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6731785/#sec21" target="_blank"&gt;may have a positive effect&lt;/a&gt; on reducing the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Using EEG, researchers found these teens show faster automatic responses to faces and dampened emotional reactivity, suggesting their brains may adapt to cope with social demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first direct evidence of how masking manifests in brain activity, shedding light on its mental cost. The findings could improve identification and support for autistic teens who go unnoticed in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Differences Detected:&lt;/strong&gt; Teens who mask autism show faster facial recognition and muted emotional response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Masking:&lt;/strong&gt; 44% of autistic teens in the study passed as non-autistic in classrooms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings highlight the need to better identify and support masked autistic teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Drexel University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some autistic teens often adopt behaviors to mask their diagnosis in social settings helping them be perceived — or “pass” — as non-autistic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers are able to observe brain functions that differ in those who “pass as non-autistic,” which could lead to a better understanding of the cognitive toll of this kind of masking, and of how these individuals could be more effectively supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brainwaves, researchers from Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute found that teens who pass as non-autistic in school settings showed faster automatic responses to faces and reduced emotional reactivity to subtle emotional facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111818"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg" alt="This shows heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings also suggest that there may be more autistic teens who pass as non-autistic than previously thought, though larger-scale research is needed to support this. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could play a key role in ensuring autistic teens, who may not feel comfortable revealing their diagnosis, can still receive the support they need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that their brains may be wired to quickly recognize social cues while dampening emotional responses, either as a preparatory or coping mechanism,” said Matthew Lerner, PhD, associate professor, leader of the Life Course Outcomes Research Program, and director of the Social Connections and Treatment Lab in the Autism Institute and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings offer the first direct evidence of how brain activity might differ in those who pass as non-autistic, shedding light on the hidden mental effort behind social masking in autism. The findings could reshape how we understand the mental toll of masking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports,&lt;/em&gt; revealed that 44% of community-recruited autistic teens passed as non-autistic in the classroom – meaning their teachers would not have noticed or identified them as autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were in the “passed as non-autistic” group showed faster initial brain response when looking at faces and showed less emotionally reactive brain response to subtle emotions in faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lerner explained that these findings reveal, for the first time, some of the ways in which autistic teens who pass as non-autistic process social information in unique ways, which differ both from non-autistic teens and autistic teens who do not pass as non-autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also suggest that there may be more autistic teens who pass as non-autistic than previously thought, though larger-scale research is needed to support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These datasets were collected as part of a larger National Institute of Mental Health-funded study examining factors impacting social outcomes in autistic teens. Importantly, this study focused on recruiting a broad population from the community, including those who did not necessarily have an autism diagnosis in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lerner added that this allowed for inclusion of teens who meet criteria for autism by formal diagnostic processes but may not otherwise have an existing diagnosis or supports in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team explained that the “passing as non-autistic” group was identified by looking at the difference between autism features as displayed in a gold-standard diagnostic setting and those displayed in classrooms (according to teachers) and at home (according to parents).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allowed for more clearly defining what we mean by ‘passing,’ because those youth who did so both unambiguously met criteria for autism by gold-standard measures and did not show any significant hints of autism in the classroom according to their teachers,” said Lerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EEG measurements were taken during a standardized procedure where participants were shown a set of faces and asked to rate their emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their event-related potential responses — the small “blips” in the brainwave that indicate a brain’s response to stimuli (the faces) — provided information about how a person differentiates a face from a non-face object, and how a person regulates their emotional response to a stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this will spur greater inquiry into identifying autistic youth who are ‘passing as non-autistic,’ determining what cognitive efforts are involved in this, and developing improved ways to support the lives of those who are doing so,” said Lerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f1e12144a4d4d3f1b0d1a071a13511a1b0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annie Korp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annie Korp – Drexel University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-04801-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Automatic and affective processing of faces as mechanisms of passing as non-autistic in adolescence&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew D.

&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough drug is fighting brain cancer head-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, &lt;a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/02/fighting-glioblastoma-one-of-the-deadliest-forms-of-brain-cancer/"&gt;killing over 10,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; each year. There is no cure for the highly aggressive disease — many patients &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9265012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;survive just nine months&lt;/a&gt; after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and extending life via surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible and radiation therapy and chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) are &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recruiting glioblastoma patients&lt;/a&gt; for a trial of the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab. Sold under the brand name Yervoy, the monoclonal antibody stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncologists are optimistic since a 43-year-old UK father shows no signs of having a tumor — he took ipilimumab before his glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” said Dr. Paul Mulholland, the consultant medical oncologist leading the trial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We saw with Ben, the one patient recruited to the immunotherapy study, NeAT-GLIO, that he has had clear scans since having the treatment and the tumor hasn’t returned more than two and a half years later.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trotman met with Mulholland, who enrolled him in a clinical trial for ipilimumab. He was the first patient in the world — and the only person in the trial — to take the drug before glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” said Trotman’s wife, Emily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking the drug, Ben underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months later, his scans are clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumor that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben and Emily Trotman wed in 2023, after he began his immunotherapy treatment. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of UCLH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumor at bay,” he added, “and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, months after his diagnosis, Ben married Emily. The couple welcomed a daughter, Mabel, earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They enjoy taking her for walks along with their rescue dog, Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to live as normal a life as possible,” Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are in a unique position of which there is no precedent and which comes with a great deal of uncertainty,” she continued. “We want to live each day as if it were our last, but we also want to plan for the future, which we hope to have.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to recruit 16 glioblastoma patients like Ben over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking ipilimumab, the trial participants will undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy and perhaps surgery depending on the extent of their disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Paul Mulholland (left) is pictured with Dame Siobhain McDonagh, who raised funds for the new clinical trial of ipilimumab. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial is being funded by Dame Siobhain McDonagh, a member of the British Parliament, whose sister died of glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma,” McDonagh said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Changing this was Margaret’s final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment will take place at the NIHR UCLH’s Clinical Research Facility at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that this new trial, with the same immunotherapy drug I received, is going ahead and others will have the opportunity to take part,” Ben said. “It will give people newly diagnosed with glioblastoma some hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

Just days later, he celebrated his 17th birthday in the hospital and underwent multiple surgeries after developing sepsis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1466049471406647" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aneurin Bevan University Health Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aneurin Bevan University Health Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as a "medical emergency" by the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12361-sepsis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis occurs when your immune system has a "dangerous reaction to an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-09-2020-who-calls-for-global-action-on-sepsis---cause-of-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis is the cause of one in five deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mullins, his experience with sepsis started after he did something many others do on a regular basis — popped a pimple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geraint Mullins&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I enjoy popping [pimples] - and when I popped it, it was just a normal [pimple]," Mullins, now 24, told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nx3gzr1no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Mullins was left with a golfball-sized abscess on his neck, which he said developed "within a few days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he started feeling "very lethargic" and "quite out of it," Mullins went to his doctor, who sent him to the hospital to undergo surgery. The surgical procedure helped drain the abscess. However, the infection was still raging a week later, which led to a secondary surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, he still has a scar on his neck. However, the outcome could have been much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very close to potentially not being here," he told the outlet. "If I wasn't as fit, I could have been dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Mullins said that he "knew absolutely nothing" about the possibility of the deadly illness. Now, he's committed to raising awareness about what sepsis looks like and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that some of the warning signs of sepsis include "slurred speech," "extreme shivering," "severe breathlessness," and "mottled" skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the WHO, "only half of the people who are diagnosed with sepsis "will completely recover. Others face death or the risk of "long-term disabilities."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The world must urgently step up efforts to improve data about sepsis so all countries can detect and treat this terrible condition in time,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said in a 2020 statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC Wales News/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California-based dermatologist Dr. Sandra Lee, otherwise known as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrSandraLee" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Pimple Popper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Pimple Popper&lt;/a&gt;, spoke to PEOPLE about the "right way to pop a pimple," though she advised against doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Be sterile, be as clean as possible. Make sure you have rubbing alcohol, clean the areas, make sure you have clean fingers or gloves are ideal, and try to use as sterile instruments as possible," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, saying, “Ideally, you want to squeeze out all that pus that’s in there because if you don’t, it can re-form or get bigger. So you really want to squeeze it just enough so you get a little tinge of blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, "Know when to pop and when to stop."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-popped-his-pimple-hospitalized-days-later-sepsis-11775701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB6aV9MalJHdGRjdmdrUHJLMFU4dWo4YXlGU0gzOEFMeEpPZjZLa0x0SWFjTEpNYnlTMUpaaUQ4TXNtRVMxU0JlVng5eUdPS01rblI2WXRJaS1abkp0TjMtVWU3bjBzdVpDZGFtVUV3dzlPS0tSVmlObkpWRktMQQ</guid></item><item><title>官员表示，拿骚县的狂犬病宣布“迫在眉睫的公共卫生威胁” -新闻日报 | Rabies in Nassau County declared 'imminent public health threat,' officials say - Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5aNW9zcENuVVdPZTF4Tjl1OWxnaW0talJiaVZvMm9JNHN3eURPcThWb1JTb1JJaTV0a0FxS3pBUF9SNUtoY2w3QU1sWF90aXdVcWNiVjd5ZGgyTlotNF9QQ2FlUV9RQ1FZVm1aVDFNdmc4NUg5akN6ei1SLTYxZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="continue-reading ContinueReading_continue-reading__uTArZ active ContinueReading_active__SOMMR"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is now an "imminent public health threat" in Nassau County, officials said Monday, warning residents to stay away from wild animals and to protect their pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance shows the virus is circulating throughout the county, which has collected and confirmed 25 rabid animals since July 2024. That number includes both raccoons and feral cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid raccoons have also been discovered in Suffolk County this year, predominantly in the Amityville area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a rare but deadly disease that can be passed to humans by the bite or scratch of an infected animal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have contact with a rabid animal but receive prompt treatment can avoid serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resurgence of rabies in Nassau County, with its high population density and after nearly a decade of absence, represents a serious and evolving public health concern," Nassau County Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman said in a statement. "This declaration allows us to respond to prevent further spread and protect the health and safety of Nassau County residents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the declaration allows the county to secure resources and conduct activities to address and abate the threat, officials said. That includes spreading rabies vaccine baits in areas where infected animals have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is urged not to feed or touch wild animals, stray cats or dogs. In addition, it's important to make sure pets — including dogs, cats, ferrets, horses and livestock — are vaccinated against rabies, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County Department of Health asks anyone whose pet has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal to contact them and report any dead, sick or abnormally acting animal by emailing rabies@nassaucountyny.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Rubin, an anesthesiologist who led the study, and others wrote: 'We demonstrated that an increase of 14 steps per minute during the intervention sessions increased the odds of an improvement in [endurance].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Older adults can increase their [steps per minute] and [steps per minute] can serve as a surrogate measure of activity intensity during walking interventions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Average adults walk about 100 to 130 steps per minute, according to estimates, while older and frail individuals walk about 82 steps per minute on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American also walks about 5,100 steps per day, well below the recommendation of 10,000 every 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, researchers recruited adults from 14 retirement homes near the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study defined a frail adult as an individual with weight loss, slowness, weakness, exhaustion and someone who undertook little physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants, only 35 percent were able to walk unaided with the remainder requiring a cane, walker, scooter or wheelchair at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were divided into two equal groups for walking sessions, the fast group or the relaxed group, with each led by a trained research assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adults in the exercise group saw a greater improvement than those in the relaxed group (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the first three sessions, adults were asked to walk 45 minutes at a comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the next eight sessions, participants were asked to walk 40 minutes, and start and end each session with five minutes of stair tapping — stepping and quickly tapping the toes of each foot on the edge of a step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the walking, those in the fast-walking group were also asked to increase their intensity until they reached 70 percent of their heart rate maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart rate maximum is the highest number of times the heart can beat in one minute during strenuous physical activity. It is calculated using the formula of 220 minus someone's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those in the study, their maximum heart rate would be around 147 beats per minute and 70 percent of this would be 103 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the remaining sessions, participants were asked to walk for 35 minutes but begin each session with a 10-minute warm up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But those in the exercise group were asked to incrementally increase their speed during the walking sessions to 'as fast as they safely could.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants' walking was tracked using an activPAL tracker that was strapped onto their thigh, which measured steps and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were able to stop to rest during the exercises, but this stopped the timer, which would not restart until they began to walk again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that among those in the relaxed group, their steps decreased during the study from 82 to 77 steps per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, those in the exercise group saw this rise from 86 to 100 steps per minute on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were asked to complete the six-minute walk test at the start and end of the study to measure their endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the relaxed group, participants saw a slight improvement, with the distance they walked increasing from 836 to 869 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, however, those in the exercise group saw the distance they walked increase from 843 to 1,033 feet per session - a 10 percent rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, the average American adult can walk around 2,100 feet in six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'The overall exercise dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) between the two groups only differed with respect to the intensity component as frequency and duration were kept constant between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thus, prefrail and frail older adults engaged in walking interventions can derive further improvement in their functional outcomes by increasing [steps per minute] during a fixed volume of walking exercise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although Kennedy has spent most of his public appearances campaigning for healthier foods, often with a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/dairy-industry-ice-cream-dyes-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flimsy basis&lt;/a&gt; in nutrition science, most of his policy changes have focused on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He fired all 17 members of a key vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reformulated the panel with ideological allies – including advocates directly from the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He also made Covid-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/pregnant-doctor-covid-19-vaccine-rfk-jr-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access&lt;/a&gt;; oversaw the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancellation of research&lt;/a&gt; into vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-effect-of-nih-funding-cuts-on-vaccine-access-and-hesitancy-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt;; spread &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; information about vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/vaccine-disinformation-trump-measles-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;equivocated&lt;/a&gt; about their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The greatest danger in elevating him to [Health and Human Services] (HHS) secretary was always that he would use his position to undermine public confidence in vaccines, which would lead to needless suffering and even death,” Bloomberg argued. “And so it has come to pass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bloomberg said that Kennedy’s actions were predictable, but that Senate Republicans either “deceived themselves” or “buckled to political pressure” to confirm Kennedy. He urged Republicans to pressure the White House to constrain Kennedy “or fire him”. If Americans die unnecessarily, Bloomberg said, Senate Republicans will pay at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The upheaval in vaccine policy comes as the CDC is tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an historic&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak that began in an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;under-vaccinated community&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. More than 1,300 confirmed measles cases have been reported since mid-July – though experts believe the true tally is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;far higher&lt;/a&gt;. That is the worst case count &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 1992&lt;/a&gt; at only halfway through the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. A supremely effective vaccine, preventing 97% of cases with two doses, meant it was nevertheless eliminated in 2000. Experts now believe the US may be entering a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;post-herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;” era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Three people have died in the 2025 outbreak, including two healthy children and an adult. All were unvaccinated. Measles kills between one-three children per 1,000 due to respiratory or neurological complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disease can also cause permanent disability due to brain swelling, and weaken the immune system against future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the aftermath of the deaths, he did not use his position to urge parents to vaccinate their children, or warn of the dangers of failing to do so, or declare vaccines safe, or allay misplaced concerns about them,” wrote Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Instead, he did what he has been doing for decades: He presented the safety and efficacy of vaccines as an open question for individuals to decide. Not surprisingly, the outbreak continued – and has worsened,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Guardian has contacted HHS for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9nYm9xZXcxb2prTXdQdW5La2ZIRE9LSVJ6c1Q0Z0JNbkxya0R4YTItT21KR1NtLTd4SlZMN3l2OERYeWR3dE9BQWgwZ3B2TFFsdjNWT2R4ZjJIcHU4RXdNM054SWhTdXFhaXVyNzV1eTJNVldkZHBnLTZWZk4</guid></item><item><title>专家称，今年夏天的水果有助于抵御炎热，同时促进心脏健康和大脑健康-纽约邮报 | This summer fruit helps beat the heat while boosting heart health and brain health, experts claim - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPRGVtZ0VMQ2VDVlVxVHVWR1hhV3lpamZOUWJzUTdQcUFmWS1EUWxmUVBxSlp4d01OeGZsTmNBSG1fbVFLYmxELW9MWHhvN3V5dk5Qck96RWRPVDktOHpkazZzWGtHMWtzYzY2MlN2YjdvcFF4SDh5aXZlU2x0M2pRdFh0Y0ptaTlRbTBDZDVUeFhJTHRJTWxLNkRGY1NwRkQ3bjVMcFk1NnBORXBKMWNOTml2T1luTWZx?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content featured-image featured-image__wrapper"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
						
						&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;
							





&lt;p&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaches, which are about 89% water, outshine their stone-fruit counterparts like plums and nectarines in terms of hydration, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). They also pack in similar antioxidant benefits with fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Watermelon and cantaloupe top the charts for highest water content, but peaches follow closely behind, according to the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fruits that hydrate while also providing electrolytes can help the body better replace and retain fluids than water alone, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuzzy fruits offer several electrolytes, plus many other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Peaches are rich in fiber, vitamin C and potassium,” Vandana Sheth, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All of these nutrients help support digestion, heart health, and immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A medium raw peach contains about 285 milligrams of potassium, an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a critical role in nerve function, muscle contraction, fluid balance, heart health, and blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s more potassium than many popular electrolyte supplements and about 8.4% of the daily recommended intake for men and 11% recommended for women, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. residents consume too little potassium, which increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Peaches offer several electrolytes, plus many other nutrients, according to reports. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;alter_photo – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaches are also heart-healthy options thanks to their antioxidant content. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They contain flavonoids, which help lower the risk of heart disease and support memory and cognition, and carotenoids, which can help fight inflammation and protect and restore skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early studies have indicated that the antioxidants can have potential anti-cancer effects, Sheth said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Peaches are rich in fiber, vitamin C and potassium,” Vandana Sheth (not pictured), a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist, told Fox News Digital.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flavonoids and carotenoids also give peaches their distinct color.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Peaches combine two groups of pigments that you don’t often see together in other fruits and vegetables,” Mary Ann Lila, a distinguished professor in the Plants for Human Health Institute at North Carolina State University, told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raw peaches with their skin also provide about 4% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin A and 13% of the daily vitamin C needed, plus a few grams of fiber to aid digestion and gut health, Sheth said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For those trying to limit sugar intake, pairing peaches – which contain up to 13 grams of natural sugar – with protein or healthy fats is key.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pavel Lysenko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach helps slow down sugar absorption and stabilizes blood sugar levels, added Sheth, who’s also a certified diabetes care and education specialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can add chopped peaches to your morning toast with nut butter or into your cereal or yogurt bowl, blend it into a smoothie or try grilling peaches with a sprinkle of spice,” she recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

"And every year, I just looked last night, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that's the good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, people shouldn't ignore the increases, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it strikes you, especially for the vulnerable, and we're talking about very young children under age of 4, the elderly, people who are immunocompromised — there are millions of people who are immunocompromised out there — they can really get sick," LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New COVID variants Nimbus and Stratus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest COVID variants, nicknamed Nimbus and Stratus, are "no more deadly" than &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous variants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous variants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on previous variants, like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-variant-nb181-1-in-3-cases-cdc/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NB.1.8.1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from earlier this year, for example, also did not show more severe illness compared to previous variants. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains, too, including respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic issues like fever and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccines that were made for this season do cover the current variants, so that's good news," LaPook said. "I think the bottom line here is: Don't be blasé. It's the summer, people have all sorts of things. Be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I get a COVID vaccine booster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps protect you;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps protect you&lt;/a&gt; from "severe illness, hospitalization and death," there have been some shifts in recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaPook admits we're in a bit of an odd period right now because the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC has different vaccine recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC has different vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than many of the major health organizations and societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, says pregnant people should get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the baby ... before they can get a shot, they're really relying on the mother's immunity — the mother has the antibodies, goes through the placenta, and then the baby has some protection," LaPook explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. "said it's now shared decision making," LaPook said. "So that means that go talk to your clinician about it, which is always a good idea, but it's a little bit of a different recommendation than just saying, 'go get it.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also now recommends "shared clinical decision-making" for giving healthy children the COVID-19 vaccine. While the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:currently recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;currently recommends&lt;/a&gt; most adults aged 18 and older get a 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, it says it's especially important if you're 65 and older, at high risk for severe COVID-19 or have never received a COVID-19 shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where COVID-19 cases are growing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 cases are growing in these states, according to the CDC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ArkansasHawaiiIllinoisIowaKentuckyNorth CarolinaOhioPennsylvaniaTexasVirginiaWhere COVID-19 cases are likely growing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says COVID-19 cases are likely growing in the following places:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AlaskaCaliforniaDelawareDistrict Of ColumbiaGeorgiaIndianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMississippiNew JerseyNew YorkOklahomaSouth CarolinaTennesseeWisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/what-shocked-matlock-star-kathy-bates?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:What shocked "Matlock" star Kathy Bates?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What shocked "Matlock" star Kathy Bates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/a-new-you-the-science-of-redesigning-your-personality?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A new you: The science of redesigning your personality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A new you: The science of redesigning your personality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/somebody-somewhere-star-bridget-everett?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Somebody Somewhere" star Bridget Everett;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"Somebody Somewhere" star Bridget Everett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 16:33:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE95TnF3SE5wNjFvZG85Zkg4RHZnUzV2MEk0ZHRBYldpcndNTlljcG01aDhJNjZ6bmlGTUw3b29jLWM1Q3ZkNXNJOFg0MUFpUWhPUWU1QmJrdzJUcDJkX19RRERuSXM1c3E0UV84Zlh0RzA</guid></item><item><title>您能否对身体呈阳性并服用Ozempic ？我做到了，但只是为了疼痛，而不是减肥。原因如下：每周骑自行车 | Can you be body-positive and take Ozempic?

&lt;p&gt;I made my name in cycling as an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;unapologetically fat endurance rider&lt;/a&gt;. For years, I have advocated for plus-size riders, and the need for bigger cycling clothing, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cycling-has-a-weight-problem-a-call-for-the-industry-to-be-more-transparent-about-its-weight-limits" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cycling-has-a-weight-problem-a-call-for-the-industry-to-be-more-transparent-about-its-weight-limits"&gt;improved transparency on weight limits,&lt;/a&gt; and inclusive riding communities. My journey was even chronicled in a 2021 documentary by Shimano, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JytAXpxmmQY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JytAXpxmmQY" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Bodies on Bikes&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which led to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters"&gt;creation of a nonprofit &lt;/a&gt;dedicated to size inclusion, an organization I now proudly lead as Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never let my body size or weight limit me. I have completed five &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;Unbound Gravel&lt;/a&gt; races at over 250 pounds, yet I’ll be the first to admit that my weight has made life challenging over the years. From needing a seatbelt extender on airplanes to ongoing knee pain, life as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/im-a-fat-cyclist-these-are-the-top-3-misconceptions-people-have-about-bigger-riders-and-why-theyre-wrong" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/im-a-fat-cyclist-these-are-the-top-3-misconceptions-people-have-about-bigger-riders-and-why-theyre-wrong"&gt;bigger bodied athlete &lt;/a&gt;is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;After an unsuccessful knee surgery in 2023 led to chronic pain, my orthopedic surgeon recommended weight loss as a solution. But throughout my life, I’ve tried just about every diet out there. Counting calories, cutting carbs, Weight Watchers—you name it. None ever led to lasting results. Instead, I live an active lifestyle and have come to a place of genuine self-love and acceptance with my body. I wasn’t interested in pursuing intentional weight loss again, especially not just to change a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;But, as my doctor explained, this was about the impact of carrying extra body weight on my joints. Given my lifelong struggles with dieting, he suggested there might be an underlying issue contributing to my body size and recommended I see an endocrinologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;That referral marked the beginning of my journey with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes"&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/a&gt;—a class of medications originally developed to treat Type 2 diabetes, but now increasingly prescribed for weight management. At first, I was very hesitant. These drugs, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, have sparked heated debates about body image, diet culture, and what it means to pursue “health.” But for me, this wasn’t about chasing a thinner body or losing weight, per se. It was about relieving pain and staying on the bike for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As it turned out, I had insulin resistant PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). PCOS is a common hormonal disorder that affects up to 1 in 10 people with ovaries, though it often goes undiagnosed. One of the lesser-known but significant effects of PCOS is how it can impact metabolism and weight. Many people with PCOS experience insulin resistance, meaning our bodies struggle to use insulin effectively, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. This metabolic imbalance makes it easier to gain weight and significantly harder to lose it, even with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. This explained why I was seemingly doing everything “right,” that is, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/good-bad-hungry-diets-cyclists-rated-expert-437826" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/good-bad-hungry-diets-cyclists-rated-expert-437826"&gt;eating a balanced diet &lt;/a&gt;and exercising frequently, while still carrying excess weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As a p&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;ublic figure who cultivates weight-neutral cycling spaces&lt;/a&gt; and communities, taking a GLP-1 felt antithetical to my identity. If my body changed on this medication, which was likely to happen, would I be betraying my values? Would I be sending the wrong message to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters"&gt;All Bodies on Bikes &lt;/a&gt;community? What does it mean to advocate for body acceptance while making a choice that may lead to weight loss and body changes for myself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mSkrMmvsmJQvNFdaeQJXMc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mSkrMmvsmJQvNFdaeQJXMc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;What’s more, how would it impact me on the bike?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The side effects of GLP-1s have been widely talked about: nausea, fatigue, gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) and more. I got lucky and only experienced mild nausea and constipation, however, the impact on my appetite was huge. I suddenly had almost zero hunger signals. A banana at breakfast would satiate me until lunch, when half a peanut butter sandwich would fill me up. Which to be clear, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enough food for anyone, let alone &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/nutrition-for-long-bike-rides-what-to-eat-before-during-and-after-to-avoid-bonking-and-maximise-your-cycling-fitness-gains" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/nutrition-for-long-bike-rides-what-to-eat-before-during-and-after-to-avoid-bonking-and-maximise-your-cycling-fitness-gains"&gt;an endurance athlete&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marley riding Unbound, even before her medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Marley Blonsky)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;It quickly became evident that the appetite suppression part of the drug worked a little too well, especially as an endurance cyclist who continued to train and ride throughout this experience. My body, that I had learned to listen to closely over the years, was suddenly not sending the same signals. I wasn’t hungry at all. While that’s often seen as a benefit, it’s actually the opposite of what an endurance athlete needs. You need calories to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Instead of being able to eat intuitively and trust that I was meeting my daily needs, I found myself having to set reminders to eat, planning each meal for maximum nutritional density.

This has mostly kept me from bonking while riding but it definitely isn’t fool proof. I also found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/energy-drinks-cycling-hydration-31549" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/energy-drinks-cycling-hydration-31549"&gt;liquid calories&lt;/a&gt;, small frequent snacks and protein-dense meals helped ensure I was fueling my body properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As the months went on, I started to notice small changes in both my body and my riding. Clothes felt a little looser. I could see my collarbone for the first time in my life. My chronic joint pain and inflammation receded, and my period started becoming normal and lighter. Perhaps most excitingly, I was able to climb hills that I had previously walked up. I felt stronger on my bike and noticed I was consistently hitting PRs on segments I rode all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;My first public appearance in a noticeably smaller body was at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/being-tough-is-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-moving-51-weeks-after-losing-his-leg-one-rider-returned-to-finish-the-race-that-wasnt" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/being-tough-is-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-moving-51-weeks-after-losing-his-leg-one-rider-returned-to-finish-the-race-that-wasnt"&gt;Mid South 2024&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, I had lost nearly 20% of my starting body weight. An acquaintance remarked that I looked “faster” than ever, and a social media follower commented “You’re getting skinny girl!” While I think these comments were intended to be positive, I was a little surprised. I’ve always been adamant that we shouldn’t comment on anyone’s body, regardless of size, and have publicly asked people not to comment on my body. My weight loss was not intentional, and I had no desire to promote it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Navigating the social and personal ramifications of a visibly changing body is intense. I was once again reminded how poorly society treats fat people. Whereas before I was mostly invisible, I now get unsolicited cat-calling from men, people are way nicer, and my concerns are taken seriously at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;After a complication with my prescribing doctor and insurance, I have been off the medication since May 2025. My last dose was two weeks before Unbound Gravel, where I successfully rode 109 miles (and had to relearn all my eating strategies on the fly, as I was suddenly &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hungry!) Sadly, my joint pain and inflammation have come roaring back into my life, along with my appetite. And so my health struggles continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I hesitate to share this story as a leader in the body positive world. Other leaders have been vilified for losing weight (see Lizzo) and changing their bodies. As I’ve gone through this process, it’s only reinforced my belief that all bodies are good bodies, all bikes are good bikes, and all rides should be celebrated. Regardless of my weight or size, my values, my personality, and my love of cycling are the same. Whether I wear a size 22 or a size 14, I still believe that everyone should get to experience the joy of cycling, with equipment, clothing, and a community that supports them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I also believe you should do whatever feels right for you to live happily, healthily, and pain-free, and it’s truly no one’s business but yours and your health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve learned through this journey, it’s that health is not one-size-fits-all, and it’s never just about the number on the scale. The decisions we make about our bodies, our medical care, and our well-being are deeply personal, and often far more complex than they appear from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I didn’t take a GLP-1 to become thin or fit into a narrower mold of what an athlete looks like: hell, I’m still considered “obese” by all measures. I did it to manage chronic pain, stay active and keep riding bikes. My story isn’t a prescription or a path for anyone else; it’s simply a reminder that we all deserve access to tools that help us feel good in our bodies, no matter what they look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re an elite athlete, be aware that semaglutide is currently on the WADA Monitoring Program. This means that while drugs like Ozempic are not currently banned by WADA, the agency is monitoring its use in sports to determine if it should be added to the Prohibited List in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But when the pediatrician walked in, the mood changed. “Praying?” she asked, her voice tight. The nurse and I stepped back while the pediatrician gently moved Maggie’s limbs, testing how much they could straighten or bend. While some tightness in the hips or knees can be normal for a newborn, Maggie’s joints were unusually tight and her limbs could not straighten all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The pediatrician pointed out the rounded soles of Maggie’s feet. “A handful of genetic conditions can cause the shape of her feet. Most of them are fatal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"science/genetics","type":"Keyword","title":"Genetics"},{"id":"society/children","type":"Keyword","title":"Children"},{"id":"media/social-media","type":"Keyword","title":"Social media"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/21/daughter-health-mystery-rare-genetic-disorder","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I stared at her, unable to process the word “fatal” in connection to the brand new, six-pound person I’d brought into this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the next seven days, I rarely slept. The children’s hospital put me up in a &lt;a href="https://rmhc.org/donate?c_src=paid&amp;amp;c_src2=25AORPMsearch_google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=skag&amp;amp;utm_medium=google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=18137358842&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACRPtoQgoC6CZiFvnOViCEW5k9lpb&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3rnCBhBxEiwArN0QE9vNBl_qDYtTcGtcMgbBGoJllSmAiQTsnAcPX-fhBn2Civ-A3qUhPRoCbfIQAvD_BwE" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ronald McDonald house&lt;/a&gt; a mile away from the NICU, where Maggie had been transferred. Every three hours, I walked to the NICU to breastfeed and pump. I was anxious and scared, signing off on procedures and tests, and answering dozens of questions about my pregnancy, diet, lifestyle and family history. By the time Maggie left the hospital, she had been seen by neurology, genetics, internal medicine and orthopedics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then the results came: she had tested negative for the scary fatal conditions. The relief floored me. But she also tested negative for every other known diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Why are her joints stiff?” I asked her last doctor right before discharge. He shrugged and said, “We can only get to know her as an individual. Sometimes it is not a bad thing to see how unique each person really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I agreed that accepting my daughter’s differences was essential. But I worried that the physicians had missed something. For the next two months, I sat in front of the computer, flipping through Maggie’s 50-page medical chart and searching terms like “multiple joint contractures”, “vertical talus”, “high arched palate” and “micrognathia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eventually, I discovered pictures of children with similar limbs in medical journals and studies about arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC – an umbrella diagnosis describing infants born with multiple contracted joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I showed Maggie’s new pediatrician screenshots. The condition was incredibly rare, he said; in his 30-year career, he had met only three babies who looked like my daughter, all during his time as a military physician overseas. He referred us to the closest specialty clinic, which was five states away in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“She has a community. You just haven’t met them yet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I knew the trip would be daunting with an infant and Maggie’s two-year-old sibling in tow. But for the first time, I had some answers and knew where to look for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Six months later, Maggie and I arrived for her first appointment at the clinic. We saw five specialists, which took nine hours. Some mysteries were solved. I learned the term for her feet: “&lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Congenital_Vertical_Talus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rocker bottom&lt;/a&gt;”, the soles curving like the bottoms of cartoon boats. Surgery could guide them to grow flatter and arched, so she could learn to bear weight and eventually walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since birth, Maggie’s elbows had loosened, but her knees still didn’t flex all the way. We would need to take annual weeks-long trips to Philadelphia so the doctors could slowly stretch Maggie’s ankles and knees, wrap them in casts, saw off the casts a week later, stretch a little farther, and cast again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, we had no diagnosis. “What caused all this?” I asked the doctors. I was afraid to voice my other questions: &lt;em&gt;Will she walk or talk? How different will she be from her sibling? What decisions will I have to make? How will I know what is right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the United States, parents of the one in six children &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/child-development/about/developmental-disability-basics.html#:~:text=1%20in%206%2C%20or%20about%2017%25%2C%20of%20children%20aged%203%20through%2017" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;with developmental delays&lt;/a&gt; ask such questions every day. For the approximately&lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104235#:~:text=about%2030%20million%20people%E2%80%94half%20of%20them%20children" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 15 million children&lt;/a&gt; who have received a rare diagnosis, defined as one that affects &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/rare-diseases-fda#:~:text=on%20rare%20diseases?-,What%20is%20a%20rare%20disease?,drugs%20to%20treat%20rare%20diseases." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fewer than 200,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, the future is unknowable. Some diagnoses, like Maggie’s, are so rare that &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/rare-and-orphan-diseases" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they aren’t seen as profitable subjects&lt;/a&gt; for research funding. People with these “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1502161" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;orphan conditions&lt;/a&gt;” have to rely on themselves, their families, and grassroots endeavors to fund and discover treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Navigating the maze of anxiety and “what ifs” felt relentless. Then I joined a Facebook group dedicated to the AMC specialist clinic we had visited, where parents shared pictures of their children, diagnoses, concerns, treatments and contact information for specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I introduced myself and posted pictures of Maggie. Immediately, Alyssa Wolfe, a mother and nurse, messaged me. She pointed out that her daughter, Delaney, had the same rocker bottom feet as Maggie, a rarity in the group. Our daughters both had one middle finger stuck flexed at the joint, and similar faces: a small chin, and a broad nose bridge that makes their eyes look farther apart than most babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4da723dd-340a-42ea-b464-5fbfd3c43211" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Maggie with her iPad, loaded with a program that she could use to talk.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Asha Dore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Delaney was three years older than Maggie. For years, I tracked Alyssa and Delaney’s progress through treatments, surgeries and diagnoses. Having another parent to talk to about major decisions was a huge relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen Donohoe, a physical therapist, was also in the group, as she worked with many children with arthrogryposis. She had been gathering stories from patients like Maggie and Delaney because they “were different from the others with AMC, but they had so many of the same characteristics, it was impossible to ignore”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa had met Maureen at an arthrogryposis conference before I joined the group. “In an elevator, Maureen approached me, listing off Delaney’s attributes. I asked her if she somehow read my child’s medical chart. Maureen told me, ‘No,’ but she had been hypothesizing with a geneticist about a syndrome, and she thought Delaney had it,” Alyssa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After coming across six patients with these characteristics, Maureen had told Dr Judith Hall, a clinical geneticist and pediatrician, this might be a genetic anomaly worth studying. “After Dr Hall looked at her own notes, she called me and said, ‘I have 10,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Connecting with Alyssa and Maureen was the first major step in identifying Maggie’s condition. But what was the next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As Maggie grew, her development continued to be markedly different from that of other kids her age. By the time she was three, she could scoot but not yet crawl. Most kids her age with AMC had been mobile for at least a year. But one day, in physical therapy, she suddenly stood with the help of a toy shopping cart. Then she learned to use a walker. Over the years Maureen noticed a similar trend with kids like Maggie. “They do their best weight-bearing and walking around preschool age,” she said. “When they get older, they seem to have a harder time maintaining a center of gravity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maggie was talking constantly, but her sounds were disorganized. Nobody could understand her. Most children with AMC alone had no speech problems at all. It was hard to find resources, but our speech therapist helped us get an iPad program that Maggie could use to talk. She’d press a button on a grid of images and common words, and the iPad would say the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her first sentence blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie was sitting at the dining room table eating breakfast while I washed dishes. “I need money,” her talker said in a mechanized child’s voice. I paused, holding a bowl. Maggie pressed the “talk” button again, and the sentence repeated. She pointed at my purse and threw her head back, guffawing. She’d made a joke. I said, “You need money!” over and over, laughing, nearly sobbing, dripping soapy water everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, Maggie was using her talker to ask for snacks and toys, to complain, to tell her new baby brother, “You’re cute!” At school, Maggie verbally repeated every word she or her friends pressed. By the end of the school year, the talker was gathering dust in our coat closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie’s limitations and sudden moments of progress surprised even the doctors who specialized in arthrogryposis. At every turn, I wanted to celebrate her success, but the gap widened between her and the other kids with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Isolating a genetic anomaly is a “diagnostic odyssey” that many families embark on, said Dr Michael Bamshad, head of genetic medicine in pediatrics at the University of Washington. “There’s all this data that sits locked away in medical records. A physician in one state may know of three similar cases, a physician in another state may know about five,” said Bamshad, “but there aren’t many ways for those families to find each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bamshad, his colleague Jessica X Chong and their colleagues have researched &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656649/#:~:text=Methods:%20Social%20networking%20among%20families%2C%20clinicians%2C%20and,conditions%2C%20particularly%20those%20with%20nonspecific%20phenotypic%20features." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the power of social media in genetic discovery&lt;/a&gt;. They launched a secure, free genetic information sharing site, &lt;a href="https://mygene2.org/MyGene2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MyGene2&lt;/a&gt;, in 2016. “Families and clinicians can share their genetic information to help them find answers,” said Chong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa and I input our daughters’ data and hoped for more information. But the waiting game was long, and we felt powerless. Alyssa recently described it to me as a three-part process: “In the beginning, parents are typically very active on social media, trying to understand their kid and hoping to give them as normal of a life as possible,” she said. Then, “sometime in elementary or middle school, their development stalls” and the focus shifts from “fixing” the issue to maintenance through puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can all be “very isolating”, she said. “Parents with typically developing kids often stop hanging out with you.” But “an acceptance stage” can come via social media groups like ours, which are “sometimes the only place to find connection and friends who understand”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 2017, Catherine Paul-Fijten, a mother and molecular biologist who lives in Dubai, used Facebook groups to connect with parents whose kids resembled her daughter, Milou. I didn’t know about Milou yet, but she had the same physical traits as Maggie, who was five by then. Milou’s doctors had located a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/For-Patients-and-Families/Genetic-Disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;difference&lt;/a&gt; on the ZC4H2 gene shortly after birth, and Catherine organized a meeting of doctors and geneticists – including Maureen and Dr Bamshad – to review the current, albeit limited, research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen sat next to Bamshad, scrolling through pictures of Maggie, Delaney and other children with rocker bottom feet and tiny chins. Bamshad suggested that we both report our daughter’s symptoms on MyGene2 and apply for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, the diagnosis was confirmed: Maggie also had an anomaly of the ZC4H2 gene. At the time, fewer than 50 people with a similar genetic difference had ever been identified. Catherine used personal resources to start a foundation to research the impacts of this new genetic diagnosis, updating a new, dedicated Facebook group regularly with insights. The diagnosis gave us a sense of belonging through the shared goal of understanding our kids and learning how to help them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The dramatic impact of online support groups for children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470259/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5350458/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; for more than 20 years. Online information sharing among parents has been found to strengthen treatment and mental health support &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998788/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316198/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;families &lt;/a&gt;and children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15658796/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurologic disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769721213001092?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; rare &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt; as well as more common diagnoses like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647109/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jpedres.org/articles/how-parents-of-children-with-cancer-seek-information-through-online-communities-a-netnography-study/doi/jpr.galenos.2019.48378?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;childhood cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the ZC4H2 gene difference is rare, research into rare conditions is crucial – “not just for the people who have that diagnosis – but for humanity as a whole”, Catherine said. That’s because “much of what we know about the function of the human genome comes from understanding the genetic basis of rare diseases”, said Bamshad, citing examples including common heart conditions and vaccine research. “What we’ve learned about rare diseases helps us understand the genetic and molecular basis of common conditions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ZC4H2 group has nearly 200 members, though nearly 250 people with this condition have now been identified globally. Because of their stories, I was prepared. In 2023, at the beginning of sixth grade, Maggie suddenly presented with severe scoliosis, and I knew she would probably need a full spinal fusion because I’d heard about related complications from our ZC4H2 community. I shared this information with Maggie’s spinal surgeon, as well as a list of other surgeons who had had to manage these complications, and she formed a pre-emptive plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;During Maggie’s spinal surgery, I let myself get lost in the labyrinthian halls of the hospital for hours, cellphone in one hand, operating room pager in the other. As with her previous 10-plus surgeries, I didn’t allow myself to imagine what was happening or what could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As I stood in the hallway, I scrolled through encouraging comments and messages from Alyssa, Catherine and others. Despite our different jobs, family culture and background, we’d collaborated with doctors, scientists, physical and speech therapists – and each other – for more than a decade. Their support didn’t guarantee a perfect future for my daughter, but their generosity was a profound gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The operating room pager went off. My phone rang. The charge nurse told me my daughter was waking up, that surgery had been a breeze. I rushed to the recovery room, tapping the app to share the news while I waited for Maggie to be wheeled in.

(MS). That’s according to a study by researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mice lacking a protein that helps control HSV-1, infection led to the degradation of the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt;, the protective coating on nerve fibers that’s damaged in MS, triggering MS-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these mice were treated with a molecule that blocks MLKL, a protein that boosts HSV-1 infection, myelin was preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings enhance our understanding of how viruses develop and offer potential avenues for mitigating viral-induced [nerve cell] damage,” Deepak Shukla, PhD, a professor at UIC and the study’s lead, said in a &lt;a href="https://today.uic.edu/uncovering-a-potential-link-between-oral-herpes-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.70353"&gt;&lt;span&gt;MLKL‒OPTN axis regulates herpesvirus-induced neurological sequelae&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical and Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Other viruses linked to MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;mistaken immune attack&lt;/a&gt; on the myelin sheath also damages nerve cells and oligodendrocytes (the cells that produce myelin), giving rise to various neurological &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest risk factors for MS is a history of infection with the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt;, a type of herpes virus, which raises the risk of developing the autoimmune disorder by &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/01/13/epstein-barr-virus-may-be-leading-cause-of-multiple-sclerosis/?utm_source=MS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=e31c5d8e20-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_US&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_b5fb7a3dae-e31c5d8e20-74165465"&gt;more than 30 times&lt;/a&gt;. Other herpes viruses, including the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox and shingles, and human herpes virus 6, have also been linked to MS onset and progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 causes oral herpes, commonly known as cold sores, and is carried by two of every three adults. While most people with HSV-1 have no symptoms, the virus, which infects through the eyes and mouth, can stay in the body for life. It poses a particular risk to people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are infected, then your immune system is constantly locked in battle with the virus,” Shukla said. “And if for any reason you become immunocompromised, the virus can escape and damage your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous work, Shukla’s team &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03765-24"&gt;discovered a link&lt;/a&gt; between HSV-1 and a heightened immune response in the brains of mice, leading to cognitive impairment, lack of coordination, and anxiety. The researchers also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25642-z"&gt;identified a protein&lt;/a&gt;, optineurin (OPTN), as an antiviral factor that restricts HSV-1 replication and spread. Cells without optineurin were more susceptible to programmed cell death after HSV-1 infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the team found that a protein called MLKL boosts HSV-1 infection in the absence of optineurin. Without optineurin, MLKL also facilitated the transport of the virus to the cell’s nucleus, where it replicates. Further experiments confirmed that optineurin controls HSV-1 infection by triggering the degradation of MLKL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether MLKL influences HSV-1 infection in animals, the researchers infected the eyes of mice with and without the gene for optineurin. In line with cell-based results, mice lacking the optineurin protein exhibited higher infection rates four days post-infection, alongside elevated MLKL production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaging studies revealed extensive clumping, or aggregation, of MLKL in the brains of optineurin-deficient mice, but not in control mice, in response to HSV-1 infection. Also, these clumps appeared to trigger the death of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocyte death and myelin loss occurred in in brain regions that play essential roles in coordinating movements and maintaining balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In behavioral studies, mice lacking optineurin showed significantly impaired motor coordination and shaking behavior after HSV-1 infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found aggregates of MLKL in the spinal cords of a standard MS mouse model. There were also lower levels of optineurin protein in regions of MS lesions in brain tissue collected from human patients compared with healthy counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the team treated optineurin-deficient mice with necrosulfonamide, an MLKL blocker, myelin loss was prevented. In comparison, acyclovir, the standard of care for herpes infections, reduced viral loads but did not reverse demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These data suggested that the intricate link between MLKL and OPTN that serves to maintain myelin, with dysregulation of this balance resulting in severe impairments in motor functions and behaviours reported typically in MS and MS-like demyelinating disorders,” the researchers wrote. “Treatment with a MLKL inhibitor demonstrated therapeutic potential by preserving the myelin sheath and reducing neurologic damage during HSV-1 [disease].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:31:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNVEVwdVZYakM4djhHM1JGSWx4RzY1U0hIYVprb1VlQ29QTXBuVV9kbnJWRXM1bnFpMXNTX19vNUxQYndUc0hfSnUwZFljZ1JTTVNic1dJWk1rR2lQeEJhYVVpSTdZeVFlemJfVmxibjk3b05NT01DaGJLd0tma3BHV1VRRzB2VU1WX0RBTzFrNElEM0lQNlBYc0FuWURGZ0RjYjdScEFaT1NIYXpn</guid></item><item><title>在主要新研究中发现的四种生物学上不同的自闭症类型- Earth.com | Four biologically distinct types of autism discovered in major new study - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPU0hXdzltR1hfTlR6U0lmQk4xRS0yY3lqWWFZV082bUNrUmh3eEREQzQ2WjRGYjVLLXhsUnNMY0RrcWVmdVI1MzFjSkUtaWlzeWlIR1p3THN4TFAwSFdrZ1NBVkt0TmYzbVlYRDZLQjYybjN0QlV3WHR3N2plQThIRl9mZkpOWDRudkVEVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder has long challenged both science and medicine. Each type presents differently – from speech delays to social difficulties to repetitive behaviors – making it hard to define and diagnose in a clear, unified way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, clinicians, and researchers have often worked with uncertainty, relying on broad categories that mask the condition’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;complexity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simons Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have reshaped our understanding of autism. They identified four distinct clinical and biological subtypes using data from over 5,000 children in the SPARK autism cohort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift toward a person-centered view may change how autism is diagnosed and treated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autism-types-mapped-with-big-data"&gt;Autism types mapped with big data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of linking individual traits to single genes, the team used a computational model that considered each child’s entire profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed over 230 traits per child – spanning developmental milestones, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toddler-screen-time-linked-to-atypical-sensory-behaviors/"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; challenges, and repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed them to group individuals into categories that reflect meaningful differences in both behavior and biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the genetics of autism is essential for revealing the biological mechanisms that contribute to the condition, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis,” said Olga Troyanskaya, senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-four-distinct-autism-types-emerge"&gt;Four distinct autism types emerge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study defined four categories of autism. The Social and Behavioral Challenges group includes children with classic autism traits but typical developmental progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group features children who reach milestones later but often lack anxiety or disruptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moderate Challenges group has milder autism traits, no delays, and few psychiatric &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-brain-learns-study-reveals-an-unexpected-twist/"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt;. The Broadly Affected group shows a wide range of severe symptoms including delays, repetitive behaviors, and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are powerful because the classes represent different clinical presentations and outcomes, and critically we were able to connect them to distinct underlying biology,” said Aviya Litman, Ph.D. student at Princeton and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-clues-behind-autism-types"&gt;Genetic clues behind autism types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional genetic testing explains only a small portion of autism cases. This study went further by revealing distinct genetic profiles for each subtype. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broadly Affected group showed the highest rate of damaging mutations not inherited from parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group had more rare inherited variants. Though the two groups share some traits, their genetic origins differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While genetic testing is already part of the standard of care for people diagnosed with autism, thus far, this testing reveals variants that explain the autism of only about 20% of patients,” said Jennifer Foss-Feig of the Simons Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study begins to bridge that gap by offering a clearer map of which variants relate to which traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings point to specific hypotheses linking various pathways to different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; of autism,” said Litman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developmental-timing-matters"&gt;Developmental timing matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic influences behind each subtype do not act at the same time in development. In children with social and behavioral challenges, key gene mutations become active after birth. This matches the clinical picture of late diagnosis without early developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, children in the Mixed ASD group carry mutations that affect the brain during fetal development. These genetic timelines correspond to the children’s milestones, diagnoses, and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating genetic and clinical data at scale, we can now begin to map the trajectory of autism,” said Chandra Theesfeld of Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-direction-for-autism-research"&gt;New direction for autism research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification of autism types builds on years of collaborative research and was made possible through integration across genetics, psychology, and computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of Princeton Precision Health’s mission to connect biological insight with clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a whole new paradigm, to provide these groups as a starting point for investigating the genetics of autism,” said Theesfeld. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of searching for one common cause of autism, researchers can now examine the distinct mechanisms behind each group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Sauerwald, co-lead author, explained, “The ability to define biologically meaningful autism subtypes is foundational to realizing the vision of precision medicine for neurodevelopmental conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-families"&gt;What this means for families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, this research may offer new clarity and direction. Knowing a child’s autism subtype could help with planning school support, medical care, and therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding genetic causes for more individuals with autism could lead to more targeted developmental monitoring, precision treatment, and tailored support and accommodations at school or work,” said Foss-Feig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families may gain insight into what symptoms to expect and how to better plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autism-model-can-work-for-other-issues"&gt;Autism model can work for other issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study focused on autism, its methods may apply to other complex conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining clinical traits with genetic data, researchers can now identify clear subtypes where once there was only disorder-level confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to countless new scientific and clinical discoveries,” said Theesfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:22:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPU0hXdzltR1hfTlR6U0lmQk4xRS0yY3lqWWFZV082bUNrUmh3eEREQzQ2WjRGYjVLLXhsUnNMY0RrcWVmdVI1MzFjSkUtaWlzeWlIR1p3THN4TFAwSFdrZ1NBVkt0TmYzbVlYRDZLQjYybjN0QlV3WHR3N2plQThIRl9mZkpOWDRudkVEVQ</guid></item><item><title>狩猎，第5卷-肉食者 | Hunting, Vol. 5 - MeatEater</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE1ReU5RN3FPQ09KY0E4bUF0NGYzaVVTZTFXdDFnYlkxcWFKSnZNRzVjelNRTEtxbUI4WDdrZjE4NnY0UDBIdjBxNTJiVTlXeFQyc1dlakd0Q1h1cmV3bTFTZVhoOWFpUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MeatEater</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:16:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE1ReU5RN3FPQ09KY0E4bUF0NGYzaVVTZTFXdDFnYlkxcWFKSnZNRzVjelNRTEtxbUI4WDdrZjE4NnY0UDBIdjBxNTJiVTlXeFQyc1dlakd0Q1h1cmV3bTFTZVhoOWFpUQ</guid></item><item><title>第二次世界大战产生的原子废料的小溪与癌症风险增加有关- NPR | A creek with atomic waste from WWII is linked to increased cancer risk - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxNMGhMVFEwZnY1ZENfUW9FVTBTejUwUmFuTXVNOXYyd3hhMlh3b1NGSlUzRXVLZjktQkFTZE1UY1o2OU9CcTBtaURNWEZpbGZheGZ4NldEeVd0MkJXOXp6SFlWT0wyUEFnNkdLMlNnS1N3V0NyeWl4dzhqVFlkeEt6ZlRMUnIzOWFaLTlEc3ZFQWhSYkRHWkhmenlFQ2VnbnppT3pCN0RKbDliMEdRT0w3RjNELVFJQWYyX0NFLS1DQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., speaks in favor of reauthorizing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2024. The legislation, which will benefit people sickened by radiation exposure in uranium mining and nuclear weapons testing, was included in the budget bill President Trump signed on July 4, 2025.

   &lt;p&gt;Children who lived near a St. Louis creek polluted with radioactive atomic bomb waste from the 1940s through the 1960s were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetimes than children who lived farther from the waterway, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836420" target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open, &lt;/em&gt;corroborate worries that &lt;a href="https://www.stlpr.org/health-science-environment/2025-04-01/st-louis-coldwater-creek-residents-federal-compensation" target="_blank"&gt;neighbors of Coldwater Creek&lt;/a&gt; have long held about the Missouri River tributary where generations of children played.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We actually saw something quite dramatic, not only elevated risk of cancer, but one that increased steadily in a sort of dose-response manner the closer the childhood residents got to Coldwater Creek," said the study's senior author, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/marc-weisskopf/" target="_blank"&gt;Marc Weisskopf,&lt;/a&gt; an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of the Manhattan Project, &lt;a href="https://moenvironment.org/blog/brief-history-of-radioactivity-in-st-louis/" target="_blank"&gt;Mallinckrodt Chemical Works&lt;/a&gt; processed uranium in St. Louis for the development of an atomic bomb. By the mid-1940s, according to historians, the company began to haul its radioactive waste north of the city, leaving it in open steel drums, unattended and exposed to the elements, next to Coldwater Creek.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The study's release comes shortly after passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" which contained a &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-passes-reca-secures-new-medicaid-funding-in-senate-reconciliation-bill/__;!!Iwwt!RpIk0hm2iuov0N-Cy-QCKvDHyND1ZkmXa57Pi4rgJ3Y-LTKdWcSVMAsVpL-a5cpxucqHkavllw61dklvBFU$" target="_blank"&gt;little-known provision&lt;/a&gt; to help people sickened by exposure to nuclear waste in Missouri and elsewhere. It provides &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3853/text#:~:text=%E2%80%9C(c)%20Payments%20to%20beneficiaries,shares%20to%20each%20surviving%20child." target="_blank"&gt;payments of $25,000&lt;/a&gt; to families of people who died as a result of &lt;a href="https://knpr.org/2025-07-09/radiation-exposure-compensation-act-is-renewed" target="_blank"&gt;radiation-linked cancers in the St. Louis area&lt;/a&gt; and $50,000 to those who developed the cancers and survived.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Like the new study, the provision recognizes the potential health risks from lower radiation levels associated with the production of the atomic bomb. Previous legislation, the &lt;a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43956.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Radiation Exposure Compensation Act&lt;/a&gt;, known as RECA, expired last year after paying out $2.6 billion to people who developed cancer after exposure to high-dose radiation from participating in onsite atomic weapon testing, mining or hauling uranium or being downwind of the Nevada test site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78520" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, made sure the RECA reauthorization was included in the recently passed budget bill and that it included benefits for his constituents who lived near the contaminated creek.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, pushed to get a new version of RECA into the Trump budget bill. Hawley had been a vocal critic of the BBB's $900 billion cut to Medicaid, but in the end voted for the massive package of tax and spending cuts. Hawley's yes vote came after a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added to the BBB. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Research treasure trove: Decades-old baby teeth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Weisskopf and his research team had the addresses of 4,209 tooth donors from the St. Louis Baby Tooth Survey. Participants, born between 1945 and 1966, donated their baby teeth for science starting in 1958 and joined the new experiment between 2021 and 2024. Weisskopf initially planned to study cognitive decline, but after participants repeatedly mentioned Coldwater Creek, he pivoted to investigating proximity to the creek and cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Almost one-quarter of the participants reported having cancer. Those who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children were 44% more likely to report having cancer than those who lived more than 20 kilometers away. Even more striking, those who lived within one kilometer of the creek were 85% more likely to have radiosensitive cancers, cancers believed to be caused by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/smith-bindman.rebecca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman,&lt;/a&gt; a radiologist and epidemiology professor at the University of California, said she was impressed with the design of the study, with which she was not involved. "This study adds to our understanding that radiation is carcinogenic and that we have to be cautious to minimize exposures to radiation wherever possible," she said. The main source of exposure today comes from medical imaging, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the need to clean up areas, like shipyards, with radioactive waste, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A behavioral difference for boys?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Male study participants were more likely than female participants to develop cancer, Smith-Bindman noted. She and Weisskopf hypothesized that the boys were more likely to play in Coldwater Creek in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1958, scientists at Washington University began collecting the &lt;a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/stories/tooth-fairy-goes-scientific" target="_blank"&gt;baby teeth&lt;/a&gt; of children from St. Louis. The teeth were used in studies investigating possible links between cancer and the fallout from nuclear tests in the western U.S. St. Louis was chosen not because of its connection to uranium production but because milk in the Midwest had some of the nation's highest levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;High concentrations of strontium-90 found in donated baby teeth contributed to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21319726/" target="_blank"&gt;A 2011 study&lt;/a&gt; found that men who were children in St. Louis in the 1960s and died of cancer by middle age had more than twice as much radioactive strontium in their baby teeth as men who grew up nearby and were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Though he did not use the baby teeth in his current study, Weisskopf would like to measure strontium-90 in the teeth in a future study to assess cancer risk and actual exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As boys, they might have played in the creek way more than girls, and so they got much more exposure," he said. "If that were the case, then the radiation in the teeth should be higher in the boys than in the girls."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given that the half-life of strontium-90 is 29 years, Weisskopf is eager to begin work on a more detailed study while radiation remains in the baby teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In anti-vaccine communities, it may quickly find a foothold and spread largely under the radar before ballooning into an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/texas","type":"Keyword","title":"Texas"},{"id":"society/mmr","type":"Keyword","title":"MMR"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/melody-schreiber","type":"Contributor","title":"Melody Schreiber"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-news","type":"Tracking","title":"US News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/jul/21/anti-vaxxer-measles-texas","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Brian Hooker, chief scientific officer of Children’s Health Defense, filmed an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/measles-spread-vaccine-misinformation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas in March with the parents of the six-year-old child who died from measles – the first measles death in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The video promoted several dangerous myths about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, a virus that can be deadly and can cause lifelong harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker and Polly Tommey, an anti-vaccine film-maker with Children’s Health Defense, also interviewed other Mennonite families in west Texas. And they visited the medical office of Ben Edwards while patients and Edwards himself had symptomatic measles, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker then traveled home to Redding, California, and developed measles symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Full disclosure, 18 days after visiting Seminole, Texas, sitting in a measles clinic and being exposed to Doctor Ben with the measles, I got the measles. So cool,” Hooker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker, Tommey, and Edwards spoke on a &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6tml4t-episode-178-measles-outbreak-update.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch on May 22. This news has not been previously reported by other outlets. Children’s Health Defense did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiry for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker doesn’t appear to have sought healthcare or testing to confirm his symptoms were measles and not another infection. Other viral and bacterial infections may cause rashes, which is why medical providers need to conduct tests to confirm measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without confirmation of his illness being measles, Hooker may spread misinformation about the illness – including what helps to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker says he turned to the alternative treatments hailed by anti-vaccine activists. Edwards had given him cod liver oil and vitamin C supplements in Gaines county, Hooker said, noting: “I stuck them in my luggage, and that’s what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if this case was measles, by not seeking confirmation testing and notifying officials, Hooker may have contributed to onward spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s not clear if his first symptoms appeared after 18 days, or if he developed other symptoms – runny nose, cough, fever, watery eyes – and then a rash after 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After a person is exposed to measles, the virus usually incubates for 11 to 12 days before respiratory symptoms appear, followed by a rash two to four days later. A person is considered infectious four days before the rash appears and remains infectious until four days after it fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If Hooker’s illness was measles, “it sounds like my worst nightmare as an infectious disease doc,” said Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at University of California San Francisco. “For all we know, there’s a trail of measles, like bread crumbs in Hansel and Gretel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In areas with no known cases, health providers might not immediately suspect measles, he said: “Many people probably didn’t know they had it. There could have been people who were ill with pneumonia, who went into the hospital and no one diagnosed it. It’s very, very hard to diagnose because we haven’t seen that much of it. But of course, we’re seeing a lot more of it now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are other indications that the actual number of cases from the Texas outbreak is higher than the official count, Chin-Hong said – with three confirmed deaths, experts might expect a case count closer to 3,000, instead of the 762 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and 95 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, medical providers alert local or state health officials when a patient tests positive for measles. Health officials then conduct contact tracing to notify anyone who came into contact with the patient, including other travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A representative for the Shasta county health department, serving the area where Hooker &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-hooker-ph-d-p-e-8918348/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he lives, said there have been no confirmed cases of measles reported this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are no cases of measles in Shasta county, and we have had no notice of any confirmed cases of measles this year,” said Jules Howard, community education specialist with the Shasta County Health &amp;amp; Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to know when a region has even a single case so resources can be diverted to the area to stop transmission, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most important part of those efforts is contact tracing and vaccinating anyone who is vulnerable – especially infants, pregnant people, and immune-compromised people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker is a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine community. He testified on Tuesday before a US Senate committee in its first-ever “vaccine injury” hearing, attempting to link MMR vaccination to autism – despite several studies showing no relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker said he became sick with measles despite being vaccinated as a child. But because he was born before 1989, he probably only received one dose of the MMR vaccine, which is 93% effective at stopping illness. Vaccination may also make breakthrough illness milder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When anti-vaccine messages keep parents from getting their children vaccinated, “I think the damage is immediate,” Chin-Hong said, before adding that it “goes beyond the measles outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other vaccine-preventable illnesses like whooping cough and the flu are also surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is like the poster child, but it’s about a way of life that we’ve taken for granted in the last few decades that is threatened,” Chin-Hong said. “The fact that [they] are questioning it on a public stage means that a lot more people who might have trusted their clinicians are questioning it more now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US eliminated measles in 2000, but the nation could lose that status if there is sustained transmission for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re going back in time,” Chin-Hong said. “We have to relearn all of these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9UaXdVdmtRb3I4ZERCLXplcTJXMFNPZkVWd2IzSWxELXdjRVQyME8xM0tVbVZDclFJRUpQTHRPZGxRVFA4V05ycUhhR2xYYS1vVUtQQUZlRWhIVU1jRmdMZ2ZNbWNvVy1HeC12eGtpWXlHTVRMRXJ1bkM3Y1NtUQ</guid></item><item><title>抗癌药物能否成为阿尔茨海默氏症治疗的未来？ -雅虎主页 | Could cancer drugs be the future of Alzheimer's treatment? - Yahoo Home</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNU3JmM0NjeUY1aVhZdHBZUk5Ca1A1RjBIbEhyLVN1d2tWSzh5Z1VCc2h3NXV0RVpCTmh1ZlRVc3lNYTQtSVN0M1RDQTVYRHo2d1Y4Qk16ZjZUc3BraFk0V1VMcTNtWkNGNlZHaW95THFwYlVZUHRaVmZ3X0lzZjFKUi1Bbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With few treatments available to stop or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have turned to cancer drugs as a potential means of walking back cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s cases are rising in the United States and worldwide due to an aging population, but there is no cure for the disease. Attempts to develop new treatments that slow the disease’s progress, rather than lessen symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-alzheimers-drugs-keep-scientists-shift-focus-rcna40288" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have frequently failed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;have frequently failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Only two drugs — the antibody therapies Leqembi and Kisunla — are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow the progression of early Alzheimer’s, and scientists say their benefits are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some pharmaceutical companies have halted or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biogen-stop-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-rcna136619" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:abandoned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; their Alzheimer’s drug development programs because of unsuccessful trials. Others are trying to use existing medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/eli-lilly-to-take-big-swings-in-alzheimers-als-and-gene-therapy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:popular weight loss drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;popular weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, to combat Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With that in mind, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a broad search for drugs that could be repurposed to treat the condition — in theory, reducing the time in which the drugs could be made available to patients. They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published Monday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’ database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In &lt;span&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/span&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important. Letrozole can cause hot flashes and irinotecan can cause severe diarrhea. Both drugs can lead to nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These drugs have huge side effects, so you need to always balance and figure out whether those types of side effects would be amenable to somebody with Alzheimer’s,” Sirota said. “It’s not that it’s a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-drugs-future-alzheimers-treatment-rcna219581" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNU3JmM0NjeUY1aVhZdHBZUk5Ca1A1RjBIbEhyLVN1d2tWSzh5Z1VCc2h3NXV0RVpCTmh1ZlRVc3lNYTQtSVN0M1RDQTVYRHo2d1Y4Qk16ZjZUc3BraFk0V1VMcTNtWkNGNlZHaW95THFwYlVZUHRaVmZ3X0lzZjFKUi1Bbw</guid></item><item><title>科学家确定了可能逆转阿尔茨海默氏症期间大脑中发生的变化的抗癌药物- Medical Xpress | Scientists identify cancer drugs that may reverse the changes that occur in the brain during Alzheimer's - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQRmJKNjZuajhZMzhITDBVZDg2SmNUSDYxcGxRdERISi1fa3ZOZWl6NHctXzczYkZlcDFUaXNOVTZmZ2pld2tROFp2NVFhLTFiNHNHeUVDTEJlNlU5cm1iZ05rVGUyQW9VZDdNRVlrZVFTSDVQci1haVJGZlpRT2RfX2VVY2F2THpO?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at UC San Francisco and Gladstone Institutes have identified cancer drugs that promise to reverse the changes that occur in the brain during Alzheimer's, potentially slowing or even reversing its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study compared the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; signature of Alzheimer's disease with those elicited by 1,300 approved drugs and found a combination of two cancer medications that could treat the most common form of dementia. The findings appear in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study first analyzed how Alzheimer's disease altered gene expression in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single cells&lt;/a&gt; in the human brain. Then, researchers looked for existing drugs that were already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cause the opposite changes to gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were looking specifically for drugs that would reverse the gene expression changes in neurons and in other types of brain cells called glia, all of which are damaged or altered in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers analyzed millions of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+medical+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic medical records&lt;/a&gt; to show that patients who took some of these drugs as part of their treatment for other conditions were less likely to get Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they tested a combination of the two top drugs—both of which are cancer medications—in a mouse model of Alzheimer's, it reduced brain degeneration in the mice, and even restored their ability to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease comes with complex changes to the brain, which has made it tough to study and treat, but our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+tools/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational tools&lt;/a&gt; opened up the possibility of tackling the complexity directly," said Marina Sirota, Ph.D., the interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, professor of pediatrics, and co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're excited that our computational approach led us to a potential combination therapy for Alzheimer's based on existing FDA-approved medications."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Big data from patients and cells points to a new Alzheimer's therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease affects 7 million people in the U.S. and causes a relentless decline in cognition, learning, and memory. Yet decades of research have only produced two FDA-approved drugs, neither of which can meaningfully slow this decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's is likely the result of numerous alterations in many genes and proteins that, together, disrupt &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;," said Yadong Huang, MD, Ph.D., senior investigator and director of the Center for Translational Advancement at Gladstone, professor of neurology and pathology at UCSF, and co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This makes it very challenging for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug development&lt;/a&gt;—which traditionally produces one drug for a single gene or protein that drives disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team took publicly available data from three studies of the Alzheimer's brain that measured single-cell gene expression in brain cells from deceased donors with or without Alzheimer's disease. They used this data to produce gene expression signatures for Alzheimer's disease in neurons and glia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared these signatures with those found in the &lt;a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/connectivity-map-cmap" target="_blank"&gt;Connectivity Map&lt;/a&gt;, a database of results from testing the effects of thousands of drugs on gene expression in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 1,300 drugs, 86 reversed the Alzheimer's disease gene expression signature in one cell type, and 25 reversed the signature in several cell types in the brain. But just 10 had already been approved by the FDA for use in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poring through records housed in the UC Health Data Warehouse, which includes anonymized health information on 1.4 million people over the age of 65, the group found that several of these drugs seemed to have reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to all these existing data sources, we went from 1,300 drugs, to 86, to 10, to just five," said Yaqiao Li, Ph.D., a former UCSF graduate student in Sirota's lab who is now a postdoctoral scholar in Huang's lab at Gladstone and the lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In particular, the rich data collected by all the UC health centers pointed us straight to the most promising drugs. It's kind of like a mock clinical trial."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;A combination therapy poised for primetime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li, Huang, and Sirota chose two &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+drugs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer drugs&lt;/a&gt; out of the top five drug candidates for laboratory testing. They predicted one drug, letrozole, would remedy Alzheimer's in neurons; and another, irinotecan, would help glia. Letrozole is usually used to treat &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;; irinotecan is usually used to treat colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used a mouse model of aggressive Alzheimer's disease with multiple disease-related mutations. As the mice aged, symptoms resembling Alzheimer's emerged, and they were treated with one or both drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the two cancer drugs reversed multiple aspects of Alzheimer's in the animal model. It undid the gene expression signatures in neurons and glia that had emerged as the disease progressed. It reduced both the formation of toxic clumps of proteins and brain degeneration. And, importantly, it restored memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's so exciting to see the validation of the computational data in a widely used Alzheimer's mouse model," Huang said. He expects the research to advance soon to a clinical trial so the team can directly test the combination therapy in Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If completely independent data sources, such as single-cell expression data and clinical records, guide us to the same pathways and the same drugs, and then resolve Alzheimer's in a genetic model, then maybe we're onto something," Sirota said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're hopeful this can be swiftly translated into a real solution for millions of patients with Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;

Attempts to develop new treatments that slow the disease’s progress, rather than lessen symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-alzheimers-drugs-keep-scientists-shift-focus-rcna40288" target="_blank"&gt;have frequently failed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-256e5f" class="body-graf"&gt;Only two drugs — the antibody therapies Leqembi and Kisunla — are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow the progression of early Alzheimer’s, and scientists say their benefits are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d7948" class="body-graf"&gt;Some pharmaceutical companies have halted or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biogen-stop-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-rcna136619" target="_blank"&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; their Alzheimer’s drug development programs because of unsuccessful trials. Others are trying to use existing medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/eli-lilly-to-take-big-swings-in-alzheimers-als-and-gene-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;popular weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, to combat Alzheimer’s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28236e" class="body-graf"&gt;With that in mind, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a broad search for drugs that could be repurposed to treat the condition — in theory, reducing the time in which the drugs could be made available to patients.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a6385" class="body-graf"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66ce04" class="body-graf"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5fb8e" class="body-graf"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e3b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed88b1" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd94e7" class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="http://letrozole" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" target="_blank"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53b57b" class="body-graf"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9763dd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73ee98" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90acd4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f27e1b" class="body-graf"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e31c" class="body-graf"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986e4" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ab613" class="body-graf"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-754b37" class="body-graf"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-671ed8" class="body-graf"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ea4a6" class="body-graf"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important. Letrozole can cause hot flashes and irinotecan can cause severe diarrhea. Both drugs can lead to nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073381" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“These drugs have huge side effects, so you need to always balance and figure out whether those types of side effects would be amenable to somebody with Alzheimer’s,” Sirota said. “It’s not that it’s a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRnp4enNZeHh1Rk5iNjJHVXd5OE8wQklNVk44S3Zwck41dXVnVVJoYXhnQ1V0d2xCRklhNUZSTFRwT1ZqQXNyaXN6T3ZCUW5HaGxCdXZYUW1jOUxIMUpYbUs4THRYTVhhYVBXUUN4bUxHNkVkbnRENGFRSkwxcS1VaVNTYlgxZThNc3ZCbHhabHV0NmxHQnhnQUJR0gFWQVVfeXFMUENMazRrb3BMM2NVS2pnTTFRS2daR3hyTnFmLTJRXzRPU1lRWDk3ZWZVLUpzeGFNdzJvclNsOUhvZUNGTG9oYzI5MWVqSDY3V3pFdGVodkE</guid></item><item><title>Tick Talk ：为什么德克萨斯州对莱姆病充满担忧- FMX 94.5 | Tick Talk: Why Texas Is Buzzing With Concerns About Lyme Disease - FMX 94.5</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV0FVX3lxTE5Ka1hzeGVjVm1uVUVyaWVYTDRCUUIwTEVMXzBwNU4xRXpteEhXb0hQN1ZlRU90WWl0dlpicko1MDBGZ0FZTU5mNzllRkRHeDRpeERpNm9IVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pod-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas is usually known for its wide-open spaces and big, beautiful sunsets, but it's also becoming an unexpected hotspot for a much tinier, and more sinister problem- ticks. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; cases are being reported across the state at an alarming rate, prompting concern among health officials. From the backyard to hiking trails, Texans are being chomped on by ticks, and some of those bites and lead to very serious, sometimes even debilitating illness. Let's take a closer look at what's behind the surge in tick activity, and what we can do to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rise in Tick Activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keranews.org/health-wellness/2025-07-21/tick-activity-higher-in-texas-this-season-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;Dr. Michael Allen&lt;/a&gt; from UNT's Health Science Center says the influx of Lyme disease reports is due in part to the fact that Texas experiences a relatively wet spring and summer, with heat that wasn't quite as oppressive as is typical, which led to the survival of ticks from winter months through til summer. Contrary to popular belief, Lyme disease is a massive concern in the United States with roughly half a million cases reported each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-erik-karits-r6PynlurQ2M-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Erik Karits on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@erik_karits?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Erik Karits&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-small-black-insect-sitting-on-top-of-a-persons-finger-r6PynlurQ2M?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease: What To Know&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2825/"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; is caused when bacteria are transmitted from a deer tick, and may cause symptoms that affect the skin, nervous system, heart, and/or joints of a person. It can affect people of any age, but people who spend more time in grassy or wooded environments are especially at risk of exposure. Not every tick bite will give you Lyme disease, and in most cases, a tick must be attached 36 hours or more before it transmits bacteria to you. Lyme disease cannot be spread from person to person, and transference to the fetus of a pregnant woman is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read More: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://kfmx.com/ixp/190/p/lubbock-bee-swarm-response/?utm_source=tsmclip&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Bee Infestation Causes Stings In South Lubbock Neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-marino-linic-M_krTMIPSLg-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Marino Linic on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@marinolinic?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Marino Linic&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-holding-a-small-bug-M_krTMIPSLg?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 to 80 percent of Lyme disease cases begin with a solid patch rash, roughly 2 inches in diameter, that appears around or near the site of the bite. In some cases, there will be multiple rashes. Early signs of the disease include headache, fever/chills, stiff neck, swollen glands, and muscle/joint pain. If the disease goes untreated in the early stage, it can become much more severe. As Lyme disease progresses, untreated, it is characterized by severe fatigue, stiff aching neck, numbness and tingling sensations in the arms and legs, and even facial paralysis. Sometimes, this array of symptoms doesn't appear for weeks, months, or even years after the tick bite. It's important to seek medical treatment immediately if you think you may have contracted Lyme disease. With antibiotics, it's almost always fully curable. However, the chances to completely cure the disease will decrease if treatment is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-erik-karits-bHwrqIAwBF8-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Erik Karits on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@erik_karits?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Erik Karits&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-persons-skin-with-a-spider-on-it-bHwrqIAwBF8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer ticks love moist areas that are shady and right around ground level. They cling to tall grass, shrubs, and bushes, waiting for a passing animal to drop onto. Once a tick reaches your skin, it typically climbs upward, looking for protected areas to latch onto. After you've spent time outdoors, be sure to check all of your most private areas for the little critters. They are very light and small, and often go unnoticed as they walk across your body. Wear light-colored clothing to easily spot them and consider tucking your pants into your socks or boots when you're out in thick grass and brush. Use insect repellent and avoid sitting directly on the ground or stone walls, and keep your hair pulled back, especially when doing things like gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep scrolling for more Texas-based news in the galleries below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Deadly Texas: The Lone Star State's Most Dangerous Insects &amp;amp; Arachnids &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encounters with Texas insects can be magical (think flights of Monarch butterflies!), but mostly they tend to be neutral or negative.

For many of us, the worry isn’t just for ourselves, it’s for aging parents, grandparents, and partners. The puzzling thing is that while some people follow all the lifestyle advice, eat well, stay social, exercise, avoid smoking they still develop Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia. Others, with risk factors, seem to dodge the diagnosis.

This prevalence increases with age, as the majority (74%) of those affected are 75 or older. Women represent nearly two-thirds of Alzheimer's cases. Additionally, an estimated 200,000 Americans under age 65 have younger-onset dementia. The number of people affected is expected to grow significantly, reaching nearly 13 million by 2050. Globally, over 55 million people were living with dementia in 2020, with Alzheimer's contributing to 60-70% of these cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research is zeroing in on something many of us take for granted: sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, how quickly we enter REM sleep—the dreaming, memory-processing part of our slumber might carry clues about Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study that sparked interest&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers pored through data from 128 adults who underwent comprehensive sleep studies. These participants fell into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;64 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;41 were classified with mild cognitive impairment, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the rest showed typical cognitive health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using overnight lab tests that tracked brainwaves, eye movements, and heart rate, the team focused on how long it took each person to reach the first REM cycle usually the most important for memory and emotional processing. They then compared this with scans showing levels of amyloid and tau, proteins that clump in the brain of someone developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key finding? People who took longer to reach REM often had higher levels of these proteins. In short, the delay in dreaming seemed linked to actual early Alzheimer’s biology even before memory loss showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.14495" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;was published in the journal Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why REM sleep matters?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard that REM is where dreams happen. But what’s less talked about is how vital it is for memory and emotional health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies suggest that monitoring and potentially improving REM sleep quality and timing might offer avenues for early detection and intervention in dementia risk and progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who get less REM sleep have a higher risk of developing dementia. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/lack-rem-sleep-linked-increased-risk-dementia/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;following older adults found those who developed dementia spent about 17% of their sleep time in REM compared to 20% for those who did not, with each 1% reduction in REM sleep associated with a 9% increase in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer latency to REM sleep (taking more time to enter REM sleep after falling asleep) is also associated with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. This delayed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429346/delayed-rem-sleep-could-be-early-sign-alzheimers" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; may disrupt memory consolidation and increase stress hormones harmful to the brain’s memory centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what can you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news: You’re not powerless. There are real steps to support better REM sleep and overall brain health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up around the same time, even on weekends. It helps anchor your internal clock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch caffeine and alcohol: Yes, wine feels relaxing in the evening, but alcohol suppresses REM early in the night. Similarly, avoid coffee or tea after lunch if you’re sensitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move earlier in the day: Morning or midday activity can help reset body rhythms and promote better, deeper sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wind down mindfully: Try a calm pre-bed routine: Reading, breathing, dim lights. &lt;keyword id="19943530" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="screens" source="keywords"&gt;Screens&lt;/keyword&gt; and bright lights confuse your body’s sleep cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See a professional: Conditions like sleep apnea or restless legs can delay REM. A sleep study may uncover untreated issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond sleep: Lifestyle matters too&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No sleep plan fixes Alzheimer’s risk alone. But combined habits exercise, blood pressure control, and social connection create a healthier brain overall, according to guidance from the CDC: Stay active, manage blood sugar and blood pressure, treat hearing loss, avoid tobacco, drink alcohol in moderation. Put together with sleep improvements, these steps offer genuine hope for longevity and better brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're regularly fading before noon, struggling to stay alert, or suspect sleep disorders at night, talk to your doctor or sleep specialist. They can run a lab sleep study or recommend safe imaging to check for early brain changes all proactive steps, not symptoms to fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;No worries, no overthinking, just awareness. Improving your sleep isn’t just self-care it’s brain care. Aim for dark, cool nights. Avoid late-night screen scrolling. Treat sleep issues seriously. Talk to doctors. And if you worry in the dark, know that science is catching up and that early testing and lifestyle changes could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your body and brain work better with a nightly reset, give them that chance. Good sleep, especially on time REM, could help the brain clean up better, feel sharper, and stay more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 14:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生和科学家一致认为，这些是唯一经过验证的构建胶原蛋白和对抗皱纹的方法-女性健康 | Dermatologists And Scientists Agree That These Are The Only Proven Ways To Build Collagen And Fight Wrinkles - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9taGx1UUVqOFJGR256WExjbldTU0RxTk45cDBjdTRZOW1pYkJoX2ktdzF5clp6aGJSMWFidkRKVkoxb0NZcDFFSGlTd3loR2lsZDF0MXlNWHNPR090UVo2MlN6V01kOEoxVUNsME94RTM3Z1VnRnVLSm1lVmNmaHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You've got this &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64970217/should-i-use-protein-powder/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64970217/should-i-use-protein-powder/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protein" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; thing down.

Fibroblasts (the skin cells that make collagen) become less active and collagen production becomes less efficient. This process typically begins in your thirties, varies by ethnicity, and speeds up by &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="menopause" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And that's not all: On top of the natural degradation of this essential building block, the onslaught of daily life and certain lifestyle habits also take their toll. “Collagen is constantly being broken down by sun exposure, environmental stressors, and enzymes within the body,” says Dr. Shah. Free radicals, unstable molecules generated by UV radiation and pollution attack and degrade the protein. And certain lifestyle factors aren't helping matters: smoking and a high-sugar diet can all affect our stores of collagen. “Less obvious contributors include chronic stress, poor sleep, and environmental pollution,” Dr. Shah adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The result: a gradual loss of skin structure, leading to wrinkles, rough texture, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="enlarged pores" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;enlarged pores&lt;/a&gt;, crepey skin, and increased fragility, often experienced as easy bruising, says Dr. Shah. The early signs of collagen loss often show around &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the eyes" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;the eyes&lt;/a&gt;, mouth (even in non-smokers), and forehead—typically areas where there’s a lot of expression from facial movement. By our forties and fifties, “fine lines deepen due to continued collagen and elastin loss and compounded by a loss of bone and fat in the cheeks and jawline, causing sagging around the jowls and neck,” says Dr. Kseniya Kobets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Basically, when collagen dips, your features look a less snatched.&lt;br data-node-id="13.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="happily-there-is-skincare-that-can-help" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Happily, there is skincare that can help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Now, some good news: you &lt;em data-node-id="15.1"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; protect what you have. “The most effective approach involves minimizing collagen breakdown by maintaining a nutrient-rich diet, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wearing SPF 30" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;wearing SPF 30&lt;/a&gt; or higher daily, and incorporating proven ingredients such as retinoids, antioxidants, and peptides into your skincare routine,” Dr. Kobets says.

UV radiation is one of the biggest culprits behind collagen breakdown, contributing to wrinkles, sagging skin, and premature aging.

First, start with lighter serums like vitamin C, then apply heavier creams or oils. Retinoids should be used at night and introduced gradually. “I like to layer vitamin C in the morning followed by sunscreen, and retinoids in the evening,” says Dr. Libby. “Peptides and moisturizers like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;hyaluronic acid&lt;/a&gt; can be layered with both for additional hydration and repair.” &lt;br data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-your-dermatologist-can-help" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;How your dermatologist can help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In-office treatments can help stimulate collagen production through controlled injury or thermal energy, which activates the body's own wound healing response, stimulating fibroblasts to churn out more collagen. “As your skin heals from these minor injuries, the resulting collagen fills in wrinkles, scars, and enlarged pores, improving skin texture and firmness,” says Dr. Kobets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The right treatment depends on a patient’s skin concerns, age, and skin condition, says Dr. Libby. “Younger patients in their 20s and 30s may be advised to focus on prevention and early maintenance with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chemical peels" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chemical peels&lt;/a&gt; and lighter &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="laser skin tightening" data-node-id="31.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;laser skin tightening&lt;/a&gt;. While patients in their forties and beyond may benefit from more corrective treatments like ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and radiofrequency to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Here's what our experts recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="33" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0.0"&gt;Chemical Peels:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-depth chemical peels (like Jessner’s) use a blend of acids to remove the outermost layers of skin. They work primarily on the skin’s surface, but can also stimulate collagen remodeling below. These are most suitable for younger patients with minimal collagen loss, says Dr. Libby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Laser Resurfacing:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients in their forties and beyond may benefit more from ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers. “These treatments partially ablate and heat the skin to trigger collagen repair and remodeling,” says Dr. Kobets. Examples include C02 lasers (ablative) and Fraxel (non-ablative), and Halo (both). “Ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and RF therapy to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” adds Dr. Libby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.2.0"&gt;Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; “Microneedling mechanically penetrates the dermis to stimulate collagen formation,” Dr. Kobets says. “It can be enhanced by combining it with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which reduces downtime and further boosts collagen synthesis.” Derived from your own blood, PRP contains growth factors that can speed both healing and results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Radiofrequency Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; These cutting-edge treatments like the famoust Morpheus8 intensifies the traditional microneedling with heat-based energy.  “It promotes deeper collagen remodeling through both physical injury and heat,” Dr. Kobets says, making it especially effective for skin tightening and deeper wrinkles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.0"&gt;Ultrasound Device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.1"&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;: For a non-invasive option, devices like Sofwave rely on focused heat to stimulate collagen deep below the surface. “This heat breaks down old collagen and signals the body to produce fresh collagen while clearing out the damaged matrix. The result is firmer, tighter skin over several weeks,” says Dr. Kobets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.5.0"&gt;Biostimular Fillers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Injectible fillers" data-node-id="33.5.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Injectible fillers&lt;/a&gt; can stimulate collagen production over time. “ Sculptra and Radiesse are the probably the best ways to build collagen locally,” says Dr. Lal.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-build-collagen-through-diet" data-node-id="34" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;Can you build collagen through diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Eating collagen doesn’t rebuild collagen, so you can’t exactly replace what’s been lost in your face through your diet. But you &lt;em data-node-id="35.1"&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;support your skin with what you eat. One essential nutrient to overall skin health, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to research" data-node-id="35.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;, is vitamin C, “which helps your body build strong collagen by activating enzymes that stabilize and form it,” says Dr.  Kobets. “Without enough of this vitamin, collagen formation is impaired—scurvy is a good example of this.” Citrus fruits, bell peppers, and leafy greens are all excellent sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While collagen-rich foods like bone broth and gelatin are often praised, they’re not broken down in a way that specifically targets the skin. “Because these proteins are distributed throughout the body once digested, they don’t necessarily reach the skin directly,” she adds. Also watch the sugar, which can cause a collagen-damaging process known as glycation. “Glycation is essentially when sugar interacts with collagen, creating a modified form of collagen called advanced glycation end products or AGEs, which are stiffer, less pliable, and break down faster than healthy collagen,” says Dr. Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-collagen-creams-and-supplements" data-node-id="37" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;What about collagen creams and supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Much has been said about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oral collagen supplements" data-node-id="38.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;oral collagen supplements&lt;/a&gt; to help improve the appearance of your skin. So what does the science say? They can help, but “not all collagens are alike,” says Dr. Lal. “Verisol collagen supplementation has been shown to improve skin quality which often translates to reducing collagen breakdown.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In fact, one study of more than 100 women ranging in age from 45-65 years old found that taking a Verisol collagen supplement experienced a statistically significant increase in collagen and elastin in skin that resulted in a significant reduction in eye wrinkle volume.

Fibroblasts (the skin cells that make collagen) become less active and collagen production becomes less efficient. This process typically begins in your thirties, varies by ethnicity, and speeds up by &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And that's not all: On top of the natural degradation of this essential building block, the onslaught of daily life and certain lifestyle habits also take their toll. “Collagen is constantly being broken down by sun exposure, environmental stressors, and enzymes within the body,” says Dr. Shah. Free radicals, unstable molecules generated by UV radiation and pollution attack and degrade the protein. And certain lifestyle factors aren't helping matters: smoking and a high-sugar diet can all affect our stores of collagen. “Less obvious contributors include chronic stress, poor sleep, and environmental pollution,” Dr. Shah adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The result: a gradual loss of skin structure, leading to wrinkles, rough texture, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:enlarged pores;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;enlarged pores&lt;/a&gt;, crepey skin, and increased fragility, often experienced as easy bruising, says Dr. Shah. The early signs of collagen loss often show around &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the eyes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the eyes&lt;/a&gt;, mouth (even in non-smokers), and forehead—typically areas where there’s a lot of expression from facial movement. By our forties and fifties, “fine lines deepen due to continued collagen and elastin loss and compounded by a loss of bone and fat in the cheeks and jawline, causing sagging around the jowls and neck,” says Dr. Kseniya Kobets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Basically, when collagen dips, your features look a less snatched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happily, there is skincare that can help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, some good news: you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; protect what you have. “The most effective approach involves minimizing collagen breakdown by maintaining a nutrient-rich diet, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wearing SPF 30;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wearing SPF 30&lt;/a&gt; or higher daily, and incorporating proven ingredients such as retinoids, antioxidants, and peptides into your skincare routine,” Dr. Kobets says. Here's your action plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t skip SPF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The first way to build collagen is to prevent its excessive breakdown with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/g27332336/best-sunscreen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;daily sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; use,” says &lt;a href="https://www.livderm.org/faculty/karan-lal-do-ms-faad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karan Lal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Karan Lal&lt;/a&gt;, DO, a board-certified dermatologist based in Scottsdale, Arizona. UV radiation is one of the biggest culprits behind collagen breakdown, contributing to wrinkles, sagging skin, and premature aging. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or higher to help reduce sun damage at the level of the dermis where collagen lives, says Dr. Lal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Velvet Screen SPF 50&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No one does SPF quite like the Australians, and this Ozzie brand crafted what our beauty director Brian Underwood says is his favorite sunscreen for oily skin. "It has a blurry and mattifying effect that works wonders on my often-greasy T-zone," he says.

First, start with lighter serums like vitamin C, then apply heavier creams or oils. Retinoids should be used at night and introduced gradually. “I like to layer vitamin C in the morning followed by sunscreen, and retinoids in the evening,” says Dr. Libby. “Peptides and moisturizers like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyaluronic acid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hyaluronic acid&lt;/a&gt; can be layered with both for additional hydration and repair.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your dermatologist can help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In-office treatments can help stimulate collagen production through controlled injury or thermal energy, which activates the body's own wound healing response, stimulating fibroblasts to churn out more collagen. “As your skin heals from these minor injuries, the resulting collagen fills in wrinkles, scars, and enlarged pores, improving skin texture and firmness,” says Dr. Kobets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The right treatment depends on a patient’s skin concerns, age, and skin condition, says Dr. Libby. “Younger patients in their 20s and 30s may be advised to focus on prevention and early maintenance with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemical peels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;chemical peels&lt;/a&gt; and lighter &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:laser skin tightening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;laser skin tightening&lt;/a&gt;. While patients in their forties and beyond may benefit from more corrective treatments like ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and radiofrequency to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's what our experts recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical Peels:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-depth chemical peels (like Jessner’s) use a blend of acids to remove the outermost layers of skin. They work primarily on the skin’s surface, but can also stimulate collagen remodeling below. These are most suitable for younger patients with minimal collagen loss, says Dr. Libby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laser Resurfacing:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients in their forties and beyond may benefit more from ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers. “These treatments partially ablate and heat the skin to trigger collagen repair and remodeling,” says Dr. Kobets. Examples include C02 lasers (ablative) and Fraxel (non-ablative), and Halo (both). “Ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and RF therapy to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” adds Dr. Libby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; “Microneedling mechanically penetrates the dermis to stimulate collagen formation,” Dr. Kobets says. “It can be enhanced by combining it with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which reduces downtime and further boosts collagen synthesis.” Derived from your own blood, PRP contains growth factors that can speed both healing and results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiofrequency Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; These cutting-edge treatments like the famoust Morpheus8 intensifies the traditional microneedling with heat-based energy. “It promotes deeper collagen remodeling through both physical injury and heat,” Dr. Kobets says, making it especially effective for skin tightening and deeper wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound Device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;: For a non-invasive option, devices like Sofwave rely on focused heat to stimulate collagen deep below the surface. “This heat breaks down old collagen and signals the body to produce fresh collagen while clearing out the damaged matrix. The result is firmer, tighter skin over several weeks,” says Dr. Kobets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biostimular Fillers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Injectible fillers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Injectible fillers&lt;/a&gt; can stimulate collagen production over time. “ Sculptra and Radiesse are the probably the best ways to build collagen locally,” says Dr. Lal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you build collagen through diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating collagen doesn’t rebuild collagen, so you can’t exactly replace what’s been lost in your face through your diet. But you &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;support your skin with what you eat. One essential nutrient to overall skin health, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;, is vitamin C, “which helps your body build strong collagen by activating enzymes that stabilize and form it,” says Dr. Kobets. “Without enough of this vitamin, collagen formation is impaired—scurvy is a good example of this.” Citrus fruits, bell peppers, and leafy greens are all excellent sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While collagen-rich foods like bone broth and gelatin are often praised, they’re not broken down in a way that specifically targets the skin. “Because these proteins are distributed throughout the body once digested, they don’t necessarily reach the skin directly,” she adds. Also watch the sugar, which can cause a collagen-damaging process known as glycation. “Glycation is essentially when sugar interacts with collagen, creating a modified form of collagen called advanced glycation end products or AGEs, which are stiffer, less pliable, and break down faster than healthy collagen,” says Dr. Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about collagen creams and supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Much has been said about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oral collagen supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;oral collagen supplements&lt;/a&gt; to help improve the appearance of your skin. So what does the science say? They can help, but “not all collagens are alike,” says Dr. Lal. “Verisol collagen supplementation has been shown to improve skin quality which often translates to reducing collagen breakdown.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, one study of more than 100 women ranging in age from 45-65 years old found that taking a Verisol collagen supplement experienced a statistically significant increase in collagen and elastin in skin that resulted in a significant reduction in eye wrinkle volume. Dr. Lal's go-to is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparkle-50-Serves-Collagen-Peptides-Supplement/dp/B07XK2S21D/ref=asc_df_B07XK2S21D?mcid=d6b070e9bbb63ac0bda30ef22644de36&amp;amp;hvocijid=4697252727000264168-B07XK2S21D-&amp;amp;hvexpln=73&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=4697252727000264168&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9197632&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435180698&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65417138%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sparkle Wellness Skin Boost Collagen Powder;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Sparkle Wellness Skin Boost Collagen Powder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Skin Boost Collagen Powder&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="ct:story;elm:img;itc:0;" class="stretched-box" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XK2S21D?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65417138%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:block [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:rounded-full [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-inkwell [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:text-center sm:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:inline-block sm:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:w-3/4 [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:text-base [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:font-semibold [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:text-white [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:leading-[2.6] sm:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:leading-[2.75] [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:transition-all [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:duration-150 [&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:ease-in-out hover:opacity-90 hover:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-grey-hair hover:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:text-starfish sm:hover:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-inkwell sm:hover:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:text-white dark:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-white dark:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:text-batcave dark:hover:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-bob dark:focus:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-bob dark:active:[&amp;amp;&amp;gt;a]:bg-bob"&gt;&lt;a class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XK2S21D?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65417138%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$33.50 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$33.50 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Libby agrees they’re not a first-line strategy but doesn’t discourage patients from taking them. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949208/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Some research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Some research&lt;/a&gt; has show that hydrolyzed collagen peptides may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28906033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help improve;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;help improve&lt;/a&gt; elasticity, hydration, and reduce fine lines by replenishing the body’s collagen stores. “While I don’t typically recommend them as a primary treatment, many patients do report benefits—like firmer skin or even less joint stiffness or bloating.

But are you really expected to go full days without eating &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though its name suggests completely going without food every other day, studies on ADF typically involve eating about 25 percent of your usual intake one day, followed by a “feast day” of eating as much food as you like. The daily see-saw approach is still restrictive, yet for some, there’s appeal to a diet that doesn’t tell you what you can and can’t eat, doesn’t require macro tracking, and doesn’t say “kitchen’s closed” at any particular hour of the day. The only thing you need to track with alternate-day fasting is your calories: You simply cut them down to 25 percent of your normal intake every other day, then eat how you like on opposite days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not right for everyone, but if you’re wondering whether or not ADF lives up to its reputation for weight loss and other health perks, we’ve gathered the research and asked the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and metabolism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most touted benefits of ADF is its impact on metabolism. According to weight-loss dietitian and nutrition writer Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition, ADF’s influence on metabolism is not unlike that of a keto diet. “Alternate-day fasting can support metabolic health by giving the body time to enter ketosis,” she says. “This is a process where your body starts to use fat as its primary energy source, rather than carbohydrates, and typically starts after at least 18 hours of fasting.” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224025161" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that ketosis may help preserve muscle mass, which in turn can support a more active metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic boost ADF may give is no small feat for body composition. A&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049520302006" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 systematic review and meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who followed this eating pattern for six months had reduced body mass index (BMI), body weight, and total cholesterol. That’s a pretty impressive combo for metabolic health—and one of the more promising alternate-day fasting benefits supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of ADF for metabolism don’t stop there. “It may also be beneficial for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7138754/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:some studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest ADF can reduce fasting insulin levels more than daily calorie restriction, though results are still mixed and may depend on the individual,” Mitri says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215592/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; have explored ADF’s effect on heart disease risk markers, such as cholesterol and blood pressure, Mitri points out. “However, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are mixed on this, and more recent research suggests ADF does not have any positive impact on heart disease,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every research study has shown dramatic results for metabolism, either. A&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that people who tried ADF didn’t experience more weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, or other metabolic measures than those who restricted calories every day, or even those who had no dietary intervention at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No shocker here: Burning fat and preserving muscle could lead to weight loss. Though studies have had varying results, some show that the back-and-forth of alternate-day fasting is more than the sum of its caloric parts. “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.586036/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows people following ADF can lose 3-7% of their body weight in 8-12 weeks, along with reductions in body fat, waist circumference, and visceral fat,” says Amy Davis, M.S., R.D. These are some of the most sought-after alternate-day fasting benefits, especially for those with weight-related health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever struggled with diets that pigeonhole your eating into narrow food categories or time windows, Davis says alternate-day fasting can be a smart choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who might benefit most include people who struggle with moderation, those who don’t like tracking food or macros, people who like large meals and find portion control difficult, and individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nadiia Borovenko / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t want to live longer? Some research shows that ADF could promote longevity, though Davis cautions that many studies have been conducted on animals, and more research is needed. Three processes that could help explain why alternate-day fasting may support longevity are autophagy, metabolic switching, and enhanced cellular function. “Autophagy is the process of cellular repair that can enhance mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative damage,” Davis explains. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10509423/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that fasting triggers these helpful activities known for extending lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic switching, on the other hand, is the cycling between feasting and fasting that’s the hallmark of ADF. “Fasting periods deplete glycogen and trigger fat oxidation, which boosts metabolic flexibility,” Davis says. Some researchers believe a flexible metabolism may play a role in supporting healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, supporting cellular health and metabolic efficiency is often considered beneficial for longevity. A fasting-based eating plan has been studied for its potential to influence markers associated with aging and metabolic function, though it’s not currently recommended as a treatment for any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important not to offset the potential benefits of fasting with the food you eat on your “off” days. “While ‘feast day’ may sound like a free-for-all, the quality of the foods consumed on those days matters, especially for longevity,” Davis says. “Certain foods have been linked to longevity, including fiber-rich plant-based options like vegetables, beans, whole grains, and nuts.” On the other hand, a diet high in ultra-processed foods has been associated with negative health outcomes, including markers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538973/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tied to a shorter lifespan.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tied to a shorter lifespan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sasithorn Phuapankasemsuk / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who shouldn’t try alternate-day fasting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any diet, ADF isn’t right for everyone. “Certain individuals should avoid alternate-day fasting,” says Davis. Those with a history of eating disorders should steer clear, she says, since the restrictive nature of fasting can be a trigger. “Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and teens should also avoid ADF, since they need consistent nutrition to support growth and development.” Lastly, those taking insulin or other diabetes meds should avoid fasting to prevent hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re OK flexing your willpower muscles, alternate-day fasting could be your sweet spot for a trimmer figure, higher metabolism, longer life, and more. Just be sure to check in with your healthcare provider before starting a new diet, especially one that involves fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT OUR EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., is a weight-loss dietitian, nutrition writer, and owner of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melissa Mitri Nutrition.
