                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The most widely used &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532" rel="nofollow"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may offer a surprise benefit for some cancer patients – revving up their immune systems to help fight tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/4c83cc7cc92a430b8c026691e77815c2" rel="nofollow"&gt;immunotherapy drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it had nothing to do with virus infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mrna-kennedy-rfk-jr-covid-flu-51babaaeb003c45473080a52d67d7d72" rel="nofollow"&gt;the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine “acts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,” said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. “We’re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" rel="nofollow"&gt;cutting $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for some uses of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPsgoqfas&amp;amp;list=PLslqZ7OaczKEUNNDVq-u_OE31P2k7UwKc&amp;amp;index=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-71306bd18785477f3a85a69caa6e09c9" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The virus was eradicated in the UK in 1966, but there have been several outbreaks since and it continues to pose a major threat to pig farming worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Classical swine fever is a devastating disease for livestock and farmers as we saw with the outbreak in the UK, 25 years ago,” said Helen Crooke, mammalian virology deputy leader at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), where the pig trial was performed. “Hopefully this breakthrough can help bolster the resilience of the livestock sector to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Classical swine fever, also known as hog cholera or pig plague, causes fever, skin lesions, convulsions, diarrhoea – and often death within 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, periodic outbreaks since the 1960s, have led to the culling of 75,000 pigs. And in countries such as China, Russia and Brazil, where the disease is endemic, CSF is controlled through costly and labour-intensive vaccination programmes and international trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a group leader at the Roslin Institute, said: “This virus has a severe effect on animal welfare and productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest study, the first to demonstrate resistance through gene editing, targeted a gene responsible for producing a protein called DNAJC14. This protein had been shown to play a critical role in the replication of pestiviruses (the virus family that includes CSF) once they enter the cell. Previous studies in cells had found that altering just a few letters of the DNA code blocked viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the latest study, scientists at the Roslin Institute created a line of pigs with the same precise edits to their DNA. Four of the pigs were then exposed to CSF, along with four control pigs, at APHA’s biosecure facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A week after inoculation, the control animals were showing symptoms of the disease and had high levels of the virus in their blood. By contrast, the gene-edited pigs were completely healthy and showed no signs of infection. Several generations of gene-edited pigs were monitored and no adverse effects on health or fertility were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The same gene is involved in the replication of pestiviruses that infect cattle and sheep – less severe diseases, but ones that continue to circulate in the UK – and the team is now investigating whether the same edit confers resistance for these species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advance comes as many countries are relaxing rules around gene editing in agriculture, with the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/02/scientists-dismayed-as-uk-ministers-clear-way-for-gene-editing-of-crops-but-not-animals" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Precision Breeding Act&lt;/a&gt; paving the way for gene-edited crops. Countries including the US, Japan and Brazil have already approved gene-edited livestock. Based on previous work at Roslin, Genus, a company based in Basingstoke, has generated pigs that are resistant to a virus that causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, which have been approved for sale in the US and are expected to go on the market there in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d32ffb06-942b-4e9c-846a-356bea728b3e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Scientists dismayed as UK ministers clear way for gene editing of crops - but not animals","elementId":"d32ffb06-942b-4e9c-846a-356bea728b3e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/02/scientists-dismayed-as-uk-ministers-clear-way-for-gene-editing-of-crops-but-not-animals"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Simon Lillico, research scientist at the Roslin Institute and a co-author, said: “In my mind there is a moral imperative that if we can make animals that are disease resistant then we probably should do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Clark, of EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute, who was not involved in the research, said: “Decades of genomic research have made it possible to pinpoint and precisely edit the genes involved in disease resistance.

        &lt;p&gt;A vaccine that prevents one of the most painful infections around could be good for your brain and heart, too. New research out this week shows the shingles vaccine is linked to a lower risk of several serious health conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University examined the health records of Americans over the age of 50. Those protected against the viral infection were less likely to develop heart disease, stroke, and a common form of dementia, they found. The findings are the latest to suggest that shingles can cause long-term consequences throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The lingering threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054"&gt;Shingles&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same germ responsible for chickenpox in children. Chickenpox typically causes a brief, if miserable, bout of illness. But afterward, the virus can survive and lie dormant in our bodies for decades. When our immune system weakens, either due to age or other factors, varicella-zoster can then reawaken and spark shingles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the second time with varicella-zoster is usually much worse. Shingles can cause excruciating pain and distinctive rashes that last for several weeks. Even after the infection is beaten back again, some people can be left with lingering, potentially lifelong nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the shingles vaccine is highly effective at preventing its return and is widely recommended for adults over 50. In recent years, studies have also started to indicate that this protection extends beyond the infection itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Protection for the brain and heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest study, the researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 174,000 adults in the U.S. They tracked the health outcomes of people vaccinated for shingles for up to seven years and compared them to similar people who instead received the pneumococcal vaccine—another vaccine recommended for older people. This second group acted as a sort of control.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, compared to controls, people vaccinated for shingles had a 27% lower risk of being diagnosed with blood clots and a 25% lower risk of heart attack or stroke. They also had a 50% lower risk of vascular dementia, a form of the condition caused by blood vessel damage in the brain, and a 21% lower overall risk of dying during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were recently presented at IDWeek 2025, the annual conference of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and other related organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Shingles is more than just a rash—it can raise the risk of serious problems for the heart and brain,” said study author Ali Dehghani, doctor of internal medicine at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/shingles-vaccine-lowers-risk-of-dementia-major-cardiovascular-events/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the IDSA. “Our study findings show that the shingles vaccine may help lower those risks, especially in people already at higher risk for heart attack or stroke.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This type of research is observational, meaning it can’t directly prove a causative link between shingles vaccination and a reduced risk of these conditions. But other studies have also supported the idea that preventing shingles can prevent &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-shingles-vaccine-could-be-a-secret-weapon-against-heart-attacks-2000598150"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. So given the already well-established benefits of the vaccine, these findings should just provide added motivation to get your shingles shots as soon as you’re eligible (the only currently approved vaccine is a two-dose series).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

adults are classified as obese, and that number could be set to skyrocket following new &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is because the criteria for &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life/signs-obesity-bmi-weight-loss-900862-20250115"&gt;diagnosing the condition is changing&lt;/a&gt;, meaning even if you weren't classed as having the health concern previously, the new guidelines mean you could now fall into that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/world-news"&gt;World&lt;/a&gt;

the Independent, doctors in Massachusetts said last week that the definition of obesity should be expanded beyond a simple body mass index (BMI) test, to instead include how fat is distributed across the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A new definition of obesity in the US means the number of people affected has jumped from 40% to 70% (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The BMI test has long caused debate over whether it's the most effective way to measure obesity, mainly because it doesn't take into account factors like muscle mass, age, and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Essentially, it doesn't distinguish fat from fat-free mass, such as muscle and bone and other bodily tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, someone with lots of muscle &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="v"&gt;could wrongly be considered obese&lt;/a&gt;, simply because their body weighs more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The criticisms prompted researches to establish a new framework, which takes into account not only BMI, but also other anthropomorphic measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Under the new framework, a person is &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life/woman-weight-loss-audio-tape-069691-20250724"&gt;classified as having obesity&lt;/a&gt; if they have a high BMI plus at least one elevated anthropometric measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Putting their new method to the test, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/science"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15xkcd006o26nkbj3j4emt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000b356nwyypmzry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Fehbs&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7Cc69cf664776b4c40810908de100dc423%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638965848813438983%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=IniV8PEDIsA5e3qIr0csq9UENlHcJO0on2bkGaZXtzI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Employer Health Benefits Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000c356n3krydd27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000d356n9k9f6erz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/health/weight-loss-drug-insurance-denials/index.html"&gt;limited Americans’ access&lt;/a&gt; to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000e356n474nvlle@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000f356n456eun78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000g356n8fnvp1z6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000h356n8j6boi8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; place last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000i356nzh04gyih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000j356nk42d22xt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/ozempic-trump-oz"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000k356n1wgxwp3o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000l356nweh83jjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000m356nq90t3bsg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000n356n05wwvanj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000o356n7431ymgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000q356nsp2gk5xy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000r356nawov76si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000s356nfkh0ly5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000t356nvlscox5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000u356njd36arps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/04/business/health-insurance-premiums-cost-increase"&gt;coverage for 2026&lt;/a&gt; could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000v356ncdv3zyr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

As well as changing the way someone’s body looks on the surface, the results show that feminizing hormones have impacts at a molecular level, with implications for susceptibility to various health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by scientists at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) in Victoria, Australia, included 40 adult trans women receiving one of two common forms of gender-affirming hormone treatment: estradiol, coupled with either cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A suite of 5,279 blood proteins was examined before starting treatment and after six months. The proteins from the participants were also compared against &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hidden-changes-to-us-health-data-swapping-gender-for-sex-spark-fears-for-public-trust-79894" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from cisgender women taken from the UK Biobank, a long-running study of 500,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the researchers discovered was that over time, receiving hormones caused protein changes in the trans women that made them more closely align with those in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/sex-and-gender-operate-differently-in-the-brain-finds-study-of-nearly-5000-kids-75133" target="_blank"&gt;cisgender women&lt;/a&gt;. Of the top 100 proteins that normally differ between males and females, 36 and 22, respectively, shifted towards the “female” form in the trans women after either hormone regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were similar to what is seen in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/menopause-misconceptions-what-actually-causes-the-symptoms-of-menopause-63920" target="_blank"&gt;menopausal&lt;/a&gt; women who receive &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-drugs-heart-health-and-chimpanzees-heres-the-latest-in-menopause-research-76493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For transgender women we found gender affirming hormone therapy alters the levels of many protein biomarkers that reflect what happens clinically,” explained senior author and MCRI Associate Professor Boris Novakovic in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may go onto impact the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases, which tend to affect more females, but decrease the risk of heart disease, more commonly seen in males. This highlights that human biology is malleable and that even in adulthood, our bodies respond to sex hormone changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as decreases in some protein biomarkers linked to male reproduction, there were also increases in proteins involved in body fat, breast development, immune function, and good heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decrease in proteins linked to sperm formation was particularly notable in the group receiving cyproterone, which was put down to the fact that this particular combination treatment causes a greater drop in testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could have implications for how transgender people receiving hormones are monitored over the long term. Novakovic said that as well as considering aspects of health that are unique to trans women, it’s important that providers recognize that trans women may also face similar health challenges to cisgender women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally, these findings could help optimize hormone therapy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studying proteins could help with the development of personalised treatment approaches by monitoring the effectiveness of gender affirming hormone therapy in trans women and help us with early detection of potential side-effects on heart health or immune function,” explained co-author Professor Ada Cheung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was relatively small and only looked at feminizing gender-affirming hormones, so more research will be needed to assess whether similar changes may be seen in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/gender-affirming-mastectomies-have-an-overwhelmingly-low-regret-rate-70184" target="_blank"&gt;transgender men&lt;/a&gt; or non-binary individuals receiving masculinizing hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been established that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/male-and-female-mammals-have-different-pain-receptors-and-we-dont-know-why-74613" target="_blank"&gt;biological sex&lt;/a&gt; affects the risk of certain diseases – females are more prone to autoimmune conditions, but males are more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases, for example. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is an &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hormone-therapy-in-teens-associated-with-better-mental-health-for-transgender-people-62209" target="_blank"&gt;important treatment&lt;/a&gt; for many trans and non-binary people experiencing gender dysphoria, so a better understanding of how it impacts the body – even down to the molecular level – is vital to protect the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/genderaffirming-hormone-therapy-is-not-bad-for-young-hearts-new-study-reports-59767" target="_blank"&gt;long-term health&lt;/a&gt; of this patient population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04023-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:07:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPaFc1NERqTElhdmdMcHBuWi1HUmFZNGpXRUZGaXNpRFkyLXg2cFNaVEhEdDNpMnplbXZ6ZDNhbUdwcC15Q1BZOU91anRVMlpOZkNZUmpiQVZBWTdOb3FXM1NaQUtnblpoQXpMMlZCcXhrZDVXVi16V1BYejhWY1pSLU9rZ2tBeXljREF1bVkweVA1bzhqZ0ZWWmNSRDhuY3RCbTRILWk5WTFYS3RNUDZZang3QkQwMTg1eHJJMVNOblRGZG5L</guid></item><item><title>随着呼吸道病毒季节的开始，联邦政府的关闭在监测方面留下了严重的空白- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/disease-surveillance-government-shutdown</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The federal government shutdown has brought respiratory virus surveillance to a halt at the national level, leaving local governments, health systems and the general public with critical blind spots as the season starts to ramp up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa000053b6ngwyj4mdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Key federal reports on flu, Covid-19 and RSV haven’t been updated in nearly a month, even as virus activity picks up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh10vqrs00043b6qjh70ehgu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These viruses kill tens of thousands of people in the US each year and hospitalize hundreds of thousands more, but they typically follow seasonal patterns and don’t spread as quickly as diseases like measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa000043b6nc5ovmpx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a shutdown, national disease surveillance reports are updated only if they “protect from imminent loss of life,” said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh208e8f00033b6nkrj2s5hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The federal government’s measles response is an “active public health intervention” and permitted by law to continue, according to a statement from the US Department of Health and Human Services, but the shutdown “thwarts the CDC’s ability to continue to publish routine flu data from its public health partners”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100063b6n0eaplexy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s general &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Respiratory Illness Data Channel&lt;/a&gt; – which offers insight into viral activity through trends in early warning signs like &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/index.html?cove-tab=1" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; surveillance and emergency department visits – was last updated September 26, a few days before the shutdown began. ﻿Weekly updates from the more specific &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-38.html" target="_blank"&gt;FluView&lt;/a&gt; have stopped, as have summary reports from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;RESP-NET&lt;/a&gt; that tracks hospitalizations for Covid-19, flu and RSV from a network of hospitals across the country. At that time, flu and RSV were already showing signs of increasing activity and Covid-19 levels were elevated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0z7rzy000y3b6q9qlxiy77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the latest 2025-26 respiratory disease season outlook from the CDC, the US “will likely have a similar number of combined peak hospitalizations due to COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to last season.” Last season, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; there were between 610,000 and 1.3 million flu hospitalizations and up to 130,000 flu deaths. There were also hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;Covid-19 hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; and between 44,000 and 63,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100073b6nmog5ns7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For people who manage their health, it’s like weather or traffic reports blinking out,” Rivers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0z8hue00113b6qqjnaub5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to questions about how the federal government is working to inform the public about respiratory virus risk and plans to adapt if the shutdown lasts long-term, HHS said the shutdown may delay answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0za5ia00153b6q67q41bop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people. During the Democrat-led shutdown, mission-critical activities at CDC will continue,” the agency said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0vyd2p00003b6qr05rj1r4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some information is still being collected by states and reported to the CDC during the shutdown, and it is often made available to the public through state dashboards. But a coordinated national assessment of trends is a necessary part of preparedness, experts say, and that has lapsed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000a3b6nvyk7lqrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The single most important aspect of any response to a problem is communication – clear, sustained communication to the profession and to the general public – and any lack of information impairs that communication,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University and spokesperson for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000b3b6nrnp0pxoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RSV, for example, follows a predictable pattern each season, experts say: Viral activity starts in the southern part of the country and moves north. &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/respiratory-illness/respiratory-syncytial-virus/_documents/2025-w41-rsv-summary.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Activity&lt;/a&gt; is already on the rise in Florida, and two outbreaks were reported in the southeastern part of the state, Rivers noted in her latest newsletter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000c3b6n9bihkuek@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without national coordination, however, other states and local jurisdictions might lack visibility into Florida’s trends and other cues they’ve historically used to plan for their own response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000d3b6nx6dt8x4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The severity and progression of each flu season can be quite unpredictable, experts say, but national analysis of data and trends can help make the season’s outlook less blurry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000e3b6nzidskqtg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the old scouting motto, ‘Be prepared,’” Schaffner said. “The information is so important to everyone in the health care world because it allows hospitals and clinics and emergency rooms to brace for what’s coming. It allows them to anticipate what their staffing needs are, their supplies … and take care of patients in a much more coherent fashion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000f3b6nwnbsdegi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            National surveillance also helps capture more comprehensive data on the virus variants that are circulating, he said, which can help raise the alarm about a potentially more severe season if the vaccine isn’t a good match or about the rise of any particularly concerning varieties such as bird flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000g3b6ndd4geuih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Laboratory testing capacities at the CDC and expert guidance to analyze local trends may also be hampered during the shutdown, experts say. Lack of visibility on emerging threats is of particular concern because of surveillance pauses. Many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;CDC researchers will also miss IDWeek, the largest annual meeting of infectious disease experts in the nation, because of the shutdown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000h3b6namioawfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people have also come to use federal respiratory virus information to manage their own health. Infectious diseases don’t stay within state boundaries, and experts say many folks want a broader view of the situation – particularly if they’re traveling for the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh10otdz00013b6qy3ncp20x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can drive some decisions around vaccination, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000i3b6n2725t11w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Anne Zink, former chief medical officer for the state of Alaska, says she knew an epidemiologist who would wait to get the flu vaccine until the data started to show an uptick in activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000j3b6naf5yna5v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “[Protection from] the flu vaccine doesn’t last for that long, so he would want to get it early enough that it would cover him for the season but late enough that it wouldn’t run out before the end of the season,” she said. “So he was always in this space that data needs to be accessible and available to everyone to be able to make that decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ypenp00063b6ql3z76vz5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the process may be more complicated and less thorough, it’s still possible to get a read on respiratory virus trends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xbtqb00053b6nkcam9cf6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The necessary state and local groundwork to track viruses is continuing, and state health departments are still updating respiratory virus dashboards. Rivers has started compiling all of the publicly available data into her &lt;a href="https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; each week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xebal00083b6noy5bmwuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zink recently helped launch the Population Health Information and Visualization Exchange, or &lt;a href="https://www.pophive.org/" target="_blank"&gt;PopHIVE&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by the Yale School of Public Health, the platform brings public and private health datasets together for a more comprehensive and real-time look at a wide range of health trends than was available before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xh6hv000b3b6ncasmluc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a long time, the government hasn’t been doing exactly what we needed it to do,” Zink said. “This is a filling a gap that’s existed long before a shutdown, and it’s just now maybe getting a little more attention because of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ypyzn000a3b6q27apt9kr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With many pathogens, a brief lapse in surveillance – as due to a government shutdown – is manageable, said Dr. John Brooks, an infectious disease physician and expert in HIV prevention who previously served as chief medical officer for CDC’s Emergency COVID-19 Response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0yrd89000e3b6qs4m5z8ot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There may be a period of delay, there may be a hiccup here or there, but generally it continues. We catch up,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xhpqe000e3b6nqvunu6tv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in the meantime, some data and surveillance problems can’t be fixed by cobbling various sources together.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100113b6nk1yo6gcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a general principle, the places where you’ll see problems arising first are in those pathogens that are transmitted most quickly and spread most rapidly,” Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100123b6n8obsauz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; continue to cause dozens of cases each week in the US, and the CDC has maintained weekly data reporting accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100133b6n53lzlyt0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu can also spread quickly, which makes “the need to be on top of the data even more acute” than for something like HIV, Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100153b6n3bz95sv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there’s a deeper concern about losing visibility on certain groups that are most affected by particular pathogens because of broader policies of the Trump administration. Soon, transgender people will no longer be reported in federal surveillance for HIV, despite having one of the highest diagnosis rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0yycj5000q3b6q774eeb2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recently formed groups such as the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative — in which state health departments have banded together to issue public health guidance separate from the CDC — may be a “needed second perspective” when it comes to tracking disease, Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100173b6nquv1060c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the work of the groups has been more focused on counterbalancing flawed guidance and policy from the CDC, Brooks said, forming these relationships now&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;also puts them “one step ahead” if the need arose to fill gaps in data surveillance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xi2d5000h3b6ng1c2ku1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In all cases, though, surveillance data creates “that fidelity of information to make sure that you are not missing where problems occurring, and so that you can bring the resources necessary to those persons to protect them and take care of them,” Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001r3b6qc5jofj2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that a pause in respiratory virus surveillance was an expected consequence of the government shutdown. Once it’s over, though, the actions the government prioritizes to ramp reporting back up will be important to watch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001s3b6qbwq6av23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When there’s a shutdown, the catchup is really expensive, so things don’t tend to come up very quickly,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “They tend to take a little bit of lead time because of the need to catch up on whatever’s been left behind.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001v3b6qib0fwnku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The time needed for that catchup is exacerbated by broader turmoil at the CDC, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001w3b6q5gq2f3qh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to estimates from a local union representing federal workers, about a quarter of the CDC’s workforce – about 3,000 workers – have been fully separated since the beginning of the year. Additional attempted reductions in force, or RIFs could effectively bring cuts to the agency up to a third.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001x3b6q7di625gb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Employees of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases are among the hundreds of CDC workers who were recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/fired-cdc-staffers-reinstated"&gt;fired in error and reinstated&lt;/a&gt; the next day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001y3b6q84bkzbnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the Trump administration could use the shutdown as a strategy to delay certain reporting – such as data around vaccine uptake – even longer, Daskalakis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001z3b6qrrqg1vv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “National Immunization Survey data as well as other data streams that people tend to look at to see what’s happening with vaccine coverage are also hampered by the shutdown,” he said. Seasonal vaccination coverage is already off to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/health/covid-vaccines-for-children-delay"&gt;slow start&lt;/a&gt; because federal Covid-19 vaccine recommendations came later than usual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg300203b6qsxavkikl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It makes me concerned that [the administration] may not prioritize that, so we won’t have visibility into what’s happening on the national point of view for vaccine coverage late into the season,” Daskalakis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg300213b6qput5i5oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As public health &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;struggles with trust&lt;/a&gt; in the US, experts say that access to timely, accurate data is critical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg300223b6qmhq70rh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To deal with an outbreak in the most successful fashion, you have to be able to communicate the latest information quickly to both medical professionals and medical institutions and to the general public,” Schaffner said. “If you don’t have the information, the communication becomes much less precise and much less useful, and that may feed the mistrust, concern and questions that the public has already about the public health system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh208we700073b6nqktz78ge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;While graying hair might feel like just one more unpleasant symptom of aging, new research reveals that it may actually be the result of a biological process that defends against cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a study led by the University of Tokyo and published earlier this month in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used lab mice to investigate how a type of stem cell reacts to DNA damage, revealing a connection between hair graying and a form of skin cancer called melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;DNA damage, aging, and cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our body’s cells are continuously faced with internal and environmental agents that can cause DNA damage, which plays a role in both aging and cancer. Scientists have struggled to pin down the specifics of this role, especially how damaged stem cells impact tissue health in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117"&gt;Stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are cells that can self-renew (make more of themselves) and differentiate (turn into other cells). Within this context, the team specifically analyzed melanocyte stem cells (McSCs)—stem cells that produce mature melanocytes, pigment-producing cells that give color to hair and skin. In mammals, McSCs live in hair follicles in the form of immature melanoblasts (melanocytes’ precursors), where they perpetuate pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, McSCs permanently differentiate and are then lost, which results in graying—a process called seno-differentiation. However, when McSCs come into contact with some carcinogens, they maintain their ability to self-renew and expand clonally. Simply put, they avoid seno-differentiation even when DNA is damaged, pushing McSCs “toward a tumor-prone fate,” according to a University of Tokyo &lt;a href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates—exhaustion or expansion—depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals,” Emi Nishimura, lead author of the study and a biologist at the University of Tokyo, said in the statement. “It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Two potential fates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, both results may come from how McSCs react to DNA damage, when they can go one of two ways—differentiate and leave the system (which leads to graying) or carry on dividing, where the persistence of damaged McSCs could ultimately result in a tumor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the researchers emphasize that their research does not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, it does suggest seno-differentiation to be a protective pathway triggered by stress that does away with possibly detrimental cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“McSC fate tracking in mice revealed that McSCs undergo cellular senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation) in response to DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in their selective depletion and hair graying, and effectively protecting against melanoma,” the researchers explained in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So next time you or an older family member complains about their gray hair—remember that it might be a trait that naturally protects against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

So I ignored this sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The relationship between night sweats and cancer is unclear. However, researchers believe multiple factors may be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Your body’s fight against cancer is one of them.

                A new study finds that cognitive training can increase the levels of a key chemical messenger in the brain responsible for decision-making, and reverse a process associated with aging.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists are &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; the first compelling evidence in people that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines with age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557825/" target="_blank"&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt; by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The increase "is not huge," says &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neurology-neurosurgery/etienne-de-villers-sidani-md" target="_blank"&gt;Étienne de Villers-Sidani&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. "But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The chemical change observed after intensive brain training is persuasive, says &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/michael-hasselmo-d-phil/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Hasselmo&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was compelling enough that I thought, 'Maybe I need to be doing this,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The result backs earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10613518/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in animals showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. Studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5477556/aging-brain-health-lifestyle-diet-exercise-social-alzheimers" target="_blank"&gt;improve thinking and memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Never skip brain day &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures," he says, "but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit," de Villers-Sidani says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers used a &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/33S" target="_blank"&gt;special kind of PET scan&lt;/a&gt; to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest," de Villers-Sidani says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think," Hasselmo says. "You go into a delirious state."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a "profound and notable effect" on memory and thinking in older people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hasselmo notes that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8949236/" target="_blank"&gt;earliest Alzheimer's drugs&lt;/a&gt; reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

They are formed by larger pieces of plastic partially degrading, and these small pieces are incredibly difficult to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On top of that, they're causing serious health concerns. These tiny fragments are shed everywhere, ending up in the air, oceans, soil, and food sources. Humans and animals then ingest and inhale the particles. Microplastics have been discovered in blood, saliva, liver, kidneys, and placenta, according to a &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard Medicine magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/03/11/microplastics-health-impacts-unknown/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; reported, microplastics have been linked to a heightened risk of heart disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and fertility issues — though the science about microplastics' human health effects is still emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about microplastics in teabags?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study calls the health risks linked to microplastics in tea bags a "significant concern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to reduce microplastics in your cozy cups of tea is to buy loose-leaf or find plastic-free teabags. If you do switch to loose-leaf tea, make sure to use a glass, metal, bamboo, or ceramic strainer rather than a plastic one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some brands, such as Pukka, Clipper, and 365, offer plastic-free or &lt;a href="https://www.clipper-teas.com/about/our-sustainability/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; tea bags.

Some companies may not use plastics derived from fossil fuels, but their tea bags do contain bioplastics. These are considered &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;harmful, but it's even better for your cup of tea to be entirely plastic-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A bonus of using loose-leaf is that you can use the leaves as compost. It not only stops you from drinking avoidable microplastics, but it also stops the teabags from clogging up landfill sites, so it's a win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/hacks-newsletter/?recdbbHseQFLEz9HF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to &lt;strong&gt;save more&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;waste less&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPSEdLLVRlNDIycVA2Z0dZcFlsSU14QlBsSmJOYjE4TDhaSm40ZXpiSlZrRDFaN05qc2xFc1hDN25ReXZZMlhzZzZPb1JzYnpGQU1iRjVyX0YyNkpnS2hOOEc3QTJ2NUh5R1FUc1BnaExZeHpzMDA1MDRYaklQSmFSLUljT1MwV1g4N1hTZzBCOTBVVk5HU3hQSmZR</guid></item><item><title>停止摄入欧米茄-3脂肪酸？研究警告称，其益处可能会“迅速”消失- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/stopping-omega-3s-benefits-may-disappear-rapidly-study-warns/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 02:39:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOS3EzUlV4a1htZDBFS3B3STNNLUNsZkpzamhZVXJXdm5LVWRrWkNTbk1IalRVbjFwZEVINzFMdTB0b284U2F3SC1QUURKOENUMmJiSzBtZHpwQU84Z1cybkJaSkNlWVVSd29lTFIwb2t6MWpoMEZGU09lMjk5aWp5amdDZGpJclVPellqSENJSQ</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，减肥对于逆转糖尿病前期并不是必不可少的- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-isnt-essential-for-reversing-prediabetes-new-study-shows</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For people with abnormally high blood sugar levels, losing weight is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;often proposed&lt;/a&gt; as the primary approach to preventing full-blown  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177747" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study challenges this approach by evaluating the efficiencies of other methods to bring levels back to safer levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the study found that the risk of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; could be cut by as much as 71 percent by following dietary and exercise guidelines, even if participants lost little to no weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaping-increases-your-risk-of-prediabetes-study-suggests"&gt;Vaping Increases Your Risk of Prediabetes, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings don't dismiss the importance of losing weight in reducing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-additive-combos-in-food-and-drinks-may-raise-risk-of-type-2-diabetes"&gt;diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt;, they could prompt a rethink on which outcomes to prioritize in strategies to treat prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Restoring a normal fasting blood sugar level is the most important goal in preventing type 2 diabetes and not necessarily the number on the scale," &lt;a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/meldung/744"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; diabetologist Andreas Birkenfeld, from the University of Tübingen in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 1,105 people with prediabetes, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0526"&gt;who were advised to follow&lt;/a&gt; a 12-month program to improve their diet and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-exercise-is-an-important-pillar-of-any-weight-management-regimen"&gt;exercise routines to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 234 members who hadn't lost weight by the end of the year, 51 still met the blood sugar criteria for prediabetes remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177750" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DiabetesChart.jpg" alt="Diabetes research chart" class="wp-image-177750 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DiabetesChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DiabetesChart-600x382.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177750" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Those who had reached prediabetes remission (R) were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those who hadn't (NR), even without weight loss. (Sandforth et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up checks on the participants were carried out for up to 10 years. Those in the group of 51 were some 71 percent less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes, compared to the other 183.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is similar to the 73-percent-reduction in risk seen in participants who had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-weight-loss-mechanism-could-one-day-trick-your-body-into-thinking-youve-exercised"&gt;lost weight&lt;/a&gt; and reached prediabetes remission after a year, compared to those who had lost weight but saw no remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further analysis on a subset of the volunteers revealed that the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/whether-you-carry-fat-in-your-arms-or-legs-could-predict-risk-of-dementia"&gt;location of fat storage&lt;/a&gt; in the body is a significant factor. The group whose blood sugar levels returned to normal without weight loss had a lower percentage of visceral fat (around the organs) compared to those whose blood sugar levels stayed elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects what we know about the relationship between visceral fat and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2010.59"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exercise and a balanced diet have a positive effect on blood sugar levels, regardless of whether weight is reduced," &lt;a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/meldung/744"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Birkenfield. "Losing weight remains helpful, but our data suggests that it is not essential for protection against diabetes."&lt;br&gt;

While our bodies may reach their peak in early adulthood, evidence now suggests that the brain continues to develop and can perform at its highest level much later in life. Understanding when cognitive and emotional abilities peak offers a fresh perspective on aging, productivity, and leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Intelligence, led by Gilles E. Gignac, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Western Australia, examined a wide range of psychological traits that influence real-world performance. The research focused on core cognitive abilities—including reasoning, memory span, processing speed, knowledge, and emotional intelligence—as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124640846" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124640846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that several traits reach their highest levels later in life. Conscientiousness tends to peak around age 65, while emotional stability may not reach its maximum until approximately 75. Overall psychological functioning appears to crest between ages 55 and 60, before gradually declining from the mid-sixties and more sharply after age 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wisdom and Moral Reasoning Improve With Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond personality traits, the study also highlights cognitive skills often overlooked in discussions of aging. Moral reasoning and the ability to resist cognitive biases—mental shortcuts that can distort judgment—frequently continue to strengthen into the seventies and eighties. Gignac noted that these improvements may explain why demanding leadership positions in business, politics, and other fields are frequently held by individuals in their fifties and early sixties. While certain abilities like processing speed may decline with age, gains in judgment, perspective, and decision-making help balance these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124640846" id="div-vdoai-mid-124640846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124640846" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Age Should Not Define Capability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these positive findings, older adults still face challenges in the workforce. Age discrimination persists, even though the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects workers aged 40 and above. According to a survey by résumé-building platform Resume Now, nearly 90% of employees over 40 reported experiencing workplace ageism, with roughly half indicating that employers favor younger candidates. Some professions, such as airline pilots and air traffic controllers, enforce mandatory retirement ages due to the high cognitive demands of these roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124640846" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings challenge societal assumptions about aging. History shows that many notable achievements occurred in midlife or later. Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species at 50, Beethoven premiered his Ninth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a rel="dofollow" href="/symphony-ltd/stocks/companyid-10473.cms" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" target="_blank"&gt;Symphony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; at 53 while profoundly deaf, and contemporary leaders like Lisa Su have delivered significant professional breakthroughs in their fifties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gignac emphasizes that cognitive ability varies widely among individuals, and evaluations should rely on actual performance rather than age assumptions. He encourages age-inclusive hiring and retention practices, reminding society that significant achievements often occur well past what is traditionally considered “peak age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend lifestyle measures to support long-term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/brain-health" target="_blank"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and fish, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and continuous learning can all help maintain cognitive functioning well into older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical performance typically peaks in early adulthood, usually between ages 25 and 35, researchers note that mental and emotional abilities follow a different timeline. Rather than declining with age, key psychological traits continue developing well into middle and late adulthood. Experts also emphasize that while genetics play a role in how the brain ages, lifestyle factors make a significant difference. Regular mental challenges—such as learning new languages, playing strategic games, or engaging in creative pursuits—can help sustain memory and reasoning skills. Combined with healthy habits, these activities may delay cognitive decline and enhance overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights how perceptions of aging often fail to match scientific evidence. Society tends to associate getting older with decline, yet data suggests that many individuals continue to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a rel="dofollow" href="/excel-realty-n-infra-ltd/stocks/companyid-29124.cms" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" target="_blank"&gt;excel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in complex thinking and emotional understanding well into their later years.

Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Overall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Fluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was "impossible" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, he said there had been a push for "generic, cheap medications" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said implementing the findings of this report would see "the 85% reduce dramatically" with "more people accessing better treatments".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The researchers are developing &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psymatik.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;a free online tool&lt;/a&gt; to help doctors and patients choose the right drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment.

But many people in their 60s, 70s and beyond may struggle for a variety of reasons to maintain the step count they used to reach. Until now it has been unclear how much people need to do as they age to reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research led by Harvard University has some answers. The large prospective study examined not only how many steps older people took but how often they reached step targets across the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers found achieving 4,000 steps per day on one or two days a week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death and lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), compared with not reaching this level on any day. The findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2025-110311" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study followed 13,547 American women over 62, with 72 the average age. They wore activity trackers for seven consecutive days between 2011 and 2015 and were followed for over a decade. None had heart disease or cancer at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the monitoring period to the end of 2024, 1,765 women died and 781 developed heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Clocking up at least 4,000 steps a day on one or two days of the week was associated with a 26% lower risk of death from all causes and a 27% lower risk of dying from heart disease, compared with not reaching this threshold on any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those achieving this step count on at least three days of the week, the lower risk of death from any cause increased to 40%, but remained at 27% for the risk of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers said the important takeaway was that it is the amount people walk, rather than the number of days on which they achieve a certain number of steps, that is most important for reducing the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no “best” way to take your steps, they added. The key thing is just to get your steps in. They concluded that a “greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On average, the women took 5,615 steps a day. This was an observational study, and as such no firm conclusions could be drawn about cause and effect. There were also several limitations to the research, notably that physical activity was assessed for only one week, and only in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers wrote: “The present study … suggests that frequency of meeting daily step thresholds is not critical (even 1to 2 days a week of [more than] 4,000 steps a day was related to lower mortality and CVD), and that step volume is more important than the frequency of meeting daily step thresholds in the older population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They added: “An important translational implication of these findings is that since step volume is the important driver of the inverse associations, there is no ‘better’ or ‘best’ pattern to take steps; individuals can undertake [physical activity] in any preferred pattern (eg ‘slow and steady’ v ‘bunched patterns’) for lower mortality and CVD risk, at least among older women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They concluded: “These findings provide additional evidence for considering including step metrics in the next [physical activity] guidelines, and that ‘bunching’ steps is a viable option for health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 22:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOOVFsNkMycFFsZGRmTW5CdUhhV0owa2V1VDRyWGJRSDZwa1cxN1h2WTlPTW0tR2VQQkZQWVd6SlhjOHJBVTdqaWNQLURHT2ZaY210XzR3czNTQkRjWTdUWk5rMDNKU0pMT053dG05aFlZaGNvcmNRX0xobk9yYnJXaXVzUVh6eXdwYlpjWmdfT1VBNTd1aVFMUURsWEJSeXlOVU13ZjdPVUwzSXd6bUE</guid></item><item><title>根据科学，每天感觉更好的秘诀- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/the-secret-to-feeling-better-every-day-according-to-science/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling better does not always require big changes. A week of five to ten minute practices improved emotional well-being and sleep while lowering perceived stress in 17,598 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program asked people to complete simple micro-acts, such as making a gratitude list, celebrating a friend’s success, or watching a short nature video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains grew with consistent participation, and the largest benefits often appeared among people facing financial strain or lower social status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-tiny-actions-matter"&gt;Why tiny actions matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elissa Epel, of the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;), co-authored the study and has examined how stress shapes health for years. Her team’s results fit with evidence that brief positive activities can shift emotions and thinking in reliable ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, found that positive psychology interventions can raise &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-gut-brain-communication-affect-emotional-well-being/"&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; and reduce depressive symptoms. Effects were small to moderate, which is typical for low burden approaches that are easy to keep doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/bigjoy?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Big Joy Project&lt;/a&gt; also tracked happiness agency, the sense that your emotions are within your control, and used a single group pre-post design, which is a before-and-after measurement approach without a comparison group, to evaluate changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-seven-days-asked"&gt;What the seven days asked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day centered on gratitude, a practice with evidence from a classic randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12585811/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, showing that listing blessings can lift mood and life satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another day asked participants to do something kind for someone they already interact with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An awe component used a short nature video followed by a few reflection prompts. The emotion of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25984788/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;awe&lt;/a&gt; is linked to a smaller sense of self and a greater willingness to help others, which can strengthen social connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other days focused on sharing a moment of celebration, ranking values, and noticing daily joy. Each activity took under ten minutes, including brief check-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-benefited-most"&gt;Who benefited most&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits were not limited to people with many resources. The largest average gains appeared among participants reporting financial strain, lower education, lower subjective social status, or identifying as Black or Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger adults showed larger increases in emotional well-being and larger drops in perceived stress than older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-minute-of-short-energy-burst-exercise-every-day-can-add-years-to-your-life/"&gt;dose-response pattern&lt;/a&gt;, a trend where stronger participation leads to stronger results, pointed to consistency as a key ingredient, with full participation outperforming partial participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-small-moments-reshape-the-brain"&gt;How small moments reshape the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that emotional habits can change the neural pathways that govern mood and attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people focus on positive emotions, activity increases in the prefrontal cortex and decreases in the amygdala. These shifts may explain why simple joyful actions can help people feel calmer and more in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short bursts of joy may also influence the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-happens-to-the-body-and-mind-during-extreme-sports/"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s built-in relaxation network that slows heart rate and supports recovery after stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, repeating small positive behaviors can strengthen these calming responses, much like short workouts strengthen muscles. The biological effects may be subtle each day but meaningful when practiced regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-does-not-claim"&gt;What this does not claim&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design did not include a control group, which means other explanations like expectation effects or outside life events cannot be ruled out. A randomized controlled trial will be important to test durability and mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week of micro-acts is not a treatment for major depression, anxiety disorders, or trauma. It is a low cost practice that can help daily life feel more manageable while other supports are pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joy is a skill they can build,” said Epel. That perspective matches the finding that people reported greater control over their own happiness after the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-put-this-to-work"&gt;How to put this to work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick one micro-act that fits naturally into your day. Do it for one week at the same time to create a steady cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the action so easy that it takes five minutes. If you want more momentum, stack a second micro-act after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track whether your stress feels a notch lower, whether you fall asleep a bit faster, or whether your patience holds a little longer. If the practice helps, keep it and rotate a new one next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are under care for a mental health condition, check with your clinician before changing your routine. These practices can complement therapy and medication but do not replace them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-research-goes-next"&gt;Where research goes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work needs randomization, follow up, and tests of what parts carry the weight. Hints point to shifts in attention, values, and social connection as likely drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dose matters here, and so does access.

Researchers found that mice on a long-term keto diet developed fatty liver disease and impaired blood sugar regulation due to stressed pancreatic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These issues were especially pronounced in males, though females showed partial resistance to liver fat buildup. The findings highlight the need for caution and medical supervision before adopting keto for long-term use, as some negative effects may reverse after stopping the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Strain:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term keto increased fat accumulation in the liver and disrupted insulin secretion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Male mice developed more severe fatty liver disease than females.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversible Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Some metabolic issues improved after stopping the diet, offering hope for recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Utah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; by University of Utah Health researchers sheds light on the long-term effects of the ketogenic diet, raising important questions about its safety and efficacy for improving metabolic health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the ketogenic diet was historically used to treat epilepsy, it has recently gained popularity for weight loss and management of conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, performed with mice, demonstrates that the diet can have potentially dangerous impacts on metabolic health, including how the body processes fats and carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113502"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person eating a keto diet." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ket-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Despite this apparent benefit, mice fed the ketogenic diet developed severe metabolic complications, with some changes starting within days. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ketogenic diet is a very high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet that was originally used to treat epilepsy. The idea is that the ketogenic diet induces ketosis, a metabolic state that produces ketone bodies, which act as an alternative brain fuel, stabilizing neuronal activity and reducing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, the diet mimics starvation, where reduced glucose availability also limits seizures, while ketones derived from fat provide the main energy source for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the diet has also been promoted for weight loss and metabolic health, but most studies have focused on short-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen short-term studies and those just looking at weight, but not really any studies looking at what happens over the longer term or with other facets of metabolic health,” said Molly Gallop, PhD, now assistant professor of anatomy and physiology at Earlham College, who led the study as a postdoctoral fellow in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The keto diet prevents weight gain&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Gallop and her colleagues conducted a long-term study in mice, placing male and female adults on one of four diets: a high-fat Western diet, a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet, a classic ketogenic diet where almost all calories come from fat, and a protein-matched low-fat diet. The mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted for nine months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, the team monitored body weight, food intake, blood fat profiles, liver fat accumulation, and the levels of blood sugar and insulin. They also investigated which genes were active in the pancreatic cells that produce insulin. Finally. they used advanced microscopy to uncover the cellular mechanisms underlying observed metabolic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic diet successfully prevented weight gain in both sexes compared to the high-fat Western diet. Mice on the ketogenic diet maintained significantly lower body weights, with weight gain primarily attributed to increased fat mass rather than lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Keto is linked to fatty liver disease&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this apparent benefit, mice fed the ketogenic diet developed severe metabolic complications, with some changes starting within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that’s very clear is that if you have a really high-fat diet, the lipids have to go somewhere, and they usually end up in the blood and the liver,” said Amandine Chaix, PhD, assistant professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of fat in the liver, known as fatty liver disease, is a hallmark of metabolic disease associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ketogenic diet was definitely not protective in the sense of fatty liver disease,” Chaix added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed notable differences in how male and female mice responded to the ketogenic diet: males developed severe fatty liver and had worse liver function, a key marker of metabolic disease, while females had no significant buildup of fat in the liver. The scientists plan to explore why female mice didn’t get fatty liver disease in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Keto diet may harm blood sugar regulation&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed a paradox in blood sugar regulation. After two to three months on the ketogenic diet, mice had low levels of blood sugar and insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem is that when you then give these mice a little bit of carbs, their carb response is completely skewed,” Chaix said. “Their blood glucose goes really high for really long, and that’s quite dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice couldn’t regulate their blood sugar properly because cells in the pancreas weren’t secreting enough insulin, the researchers discovered. Probably due to chronically high levels of fat in their environment, pancreas cells showed signs of stress, unable to move proteins around like they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that the impaired blood sugar regulation is caused by this cellular stress, but identifying the exact mechanism is a future research direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, problems with blood sugar regulation reversed when mice went off the ketogenic diet, suggesting that at least some metabolic issues may not be permanent if the diet is stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mice and humans differ, the findings reveal previously unexplored long-term negative metabolic health risks that individuals considering the ketogenic diet should take into account. “I would urge anyone to talk to a health care provider if they’re thinking about going on a ketogenic diet,” Gallop cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute on Aging (grant number R01AG065993), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (grant numbers P30DK020579, F32DK137475, T32DK110966, DK108833, and DK112826), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (grant number HL170575), and the National Cancer Institute (grant number R01CA222570).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work was also supported by the Damon Runyon-Rachleff Innovation Award (DR 61-20) and the American Cancer Society (RSG-22-014-01-CCB).

However, their long-term effects on metabolic health remain understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that, in male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 21:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9fRHNNYkFBTUI1VTh1dEFSX1NXc29QaDRER3lWMVNEYTU1c0xwbWJ1ZHoxY2FWVEd0SjZ2dmFSRjllblBtZWFUSnU2QUNzM0lUUS1pbGlxYUJDNlp1R3dmam4ybGFpQTUw</guid></item><item><title>调查发现， 90%的成年人面临着大多数人从未听说过的健康状况风险- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/2025/10/90-of-adults-are-at-risk-for-health-condition-most-have-never-heard-of-survey-finds.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="INYEC7YBJFE6DPMLPBEDMKHLHY"&gt;About 9 in 10 U.S. adults have not heard of health condition that affects nearly 90% of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VLAUUWOTORCYRGUBJFK4EQUVGQ"&gt;That’s the word from the American Heart Association, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults"&gt;which surveyed about 4,000 people&lt;/a&gt; on their awareness of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a newly defined health condition that includes heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="44LLYLWN6JCUXJUE3M34WHGG64"&gt;Most U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome including high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FIGJ7KUCRVGI3OEGRTJDTZCKGM"&gt;The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="367MJGK5IFGKTHGYPBL35ISEY4"&gt;Fortunately, most CKM risks are reversible with changes to their eating pattern, physical activity and appropriate treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EC2DNO4EV5BALNCFGUIMVSWVTQ"&gt;“We want people to know that it’s really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time.

														&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed a new class of CBD-like compounds that they say are even more effective at treating epilepsy and also promote brain cell development. But rather than extracting them from the cannabis plant, the scientists conducting the federally funded study used a common household kitchen spice: caraway seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) psychology students and faculty took the non-cannabis spice—which is commonly incorporated into breads, stews, cheeses and more–and genetically manipulated it to create compounds that closely resemble the molecular structure of non-intoxicating CBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a scientific feat on its own, the researchers are especially enthused about the results of pre-clinical trials using the caraway CBD that appear to show those compounds pack a “greater punch in stopping seizures” than natural cannabidiol found in the cannabis plant itself, with similarly low risk of adverse health events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These fully synthetic compounds, made from a safe plant extract and free of THC, not only prevented seizures and reduced seizure-related deaths but also promoted healthier brain cell development—without the sedative side effects of current treatments,” Dustin Hines, study co-author and professor of neuroscience at UNLV, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Childhood seizure disorders are often resistant to available drugs, and both the seizures and the current frontline therapies can severely affect brain development, cognition, and quality of life, making the discovery especially promising,” he &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/caraway-cure-engineering-cbd-seizure-treatments-without-cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02220-1#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology late last month, found the synthesized CBD from the seeds of caraway, which is also known as meridian fennel, “significantly reduces seizure-related mortality in both C57Bl6 adults and a developmental epilepsy mouse model, supporting its potential for further preclinical and clinical development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported with National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants, through the NIH component agencies the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors stressed that this is just the beginning of their research into the medical potential of these novel compounds, which they hope will lead to the development of new therapeutics for epilepsy. Currently, there’s one Food and Drug Administration- (FDA) approved CBD prescription drug, Epidiolex, that’s derived from cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Advancing this new class of therapeutics holds significant promise for patients who have exhausted existing treatment options, whether due to debilitating side effects or a lack of response to currently available therapies,” Adriana Carrillo, a UNLV student who participated in the study, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is encouraging to help build the foundation for future treatment options that could one day offer families safer and more effective choices,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also offered a word of advice for the curious: Caraway seeds on their own do not contain CBD, so don’t expect to derive the benefits simply by loading up on the spice, because the seeds “just contain the scaffold to create it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine and the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy will begin publishing “public health alerts” in the coming month, CIDRAP Director Michael Osterholm &lt;a href="https://idweek2025.eventscribe.net/aaStatic.asp?SFP=WldXSkRZU0dAMjQyMjY#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced at the IDWeek conference&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alerts “will basically serve to be a way to convey the information that once was shared in the MMWR with all of us in a very timely way,” he said at the opening plenary of the conference of infectious disease specialists, according to a recording shared with STAT. “We encourage all of you to begin thinking about submissions of outbreaks or data you think should be evaluated. So, I hope you’ll help participate in that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for NEJM said the alerts would be published in a new section of its NEJM Evidence journal as needed — as opposed to being published on a weekly basis — and be made available for free. “In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more information on a new, rapid digital alert to disseminate essential data on disease outbreaks and other issues of public health importance,” created in partnership with CIDRAP, she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MMWR has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published weekly since 1952&lt;/a&gt; and has become part of the bedrock of public health; historically it’s been where details of new outbreaks and emerging diseases are first reported. But many public health practitioners’ trust in the publication has been shaken. In the earliest days of the Trump administration, new articles could not be published because of a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administrations-cancels-scientific-meetings-abruptly/"&gt;communications pause&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first time in the journal’s history that it &lt;a href="https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/lets-hope-the-mmwr-resumes-publication-sooner-rather-than-later/2025/01/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;missed publishing a new edition&lt;/a&gt;. Weekly editions have been paused again during the government shutdown, and earlier this month, much of the team behind the journal was laid off before &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report-staff-fired/"&gt;being reinstated hours later&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Kent, the journal’s former editor-in-chief, left the agency in February. She &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report-staff-fired/"&gt;previously told STAT&lt;/a&gt; that administration officials were pressuring the journal to change the way it reports information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told STAT the agency “is committed to the MMWR as the nation’s trusted, science-driven source for timely and accurate health information.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CIDRAP has begun taking on tasks that have generally been done by the federal government. In April, the center &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project-help-safeguard-us-vaccine-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;created the Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, which has put out parallel vaccine recommendations to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. Several professional societies, including the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/pediatrician-group-rebuffs-rfk-issues-own-vaccine-recommendations/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics, have adopted the Vaccine Integrity Project’s recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Osterholm said more is to come from CIDRAP as it aims to shore up public health infrastructure at a moment when political support is scarce. His center, he said, turned to private foundations to secure funding for eight graduate students. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We all understand it’s hard to do anything without resources. I am here tonight to actually report to you that there are a series of activities ongoing, and I’m involved with several of them, where more than 65 foundations are going to be pooling their resources to give out in a way to protect science,” he said at the conference. “This is a very critical time that the philanthropic world has to take a very different look at what they do and how they do it. It can’t be business as usual. … Tonight I am happy to report to you we will be following up with you in the near future not just with words but with dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story has been updated to say that the public health alerts will be published in a new section of NEJM Evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Vaccine Integrity Project aims to safeguard US vaccine use so that it remains grounded in the best science, free from external influence. CIDRAP is the publisher of CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were proud to work with IDSA to help provide the evidence necessary to write COVID vaccination guidelines that people who are immunocompromised can rely on to protect their health," Kevin Griffis, Vaccine Integrity Project spokesperson, told CIDRAP News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IDSA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians have all stepped up to fill the vital need for evidence-based immunization recommendations this fall and winter, prioritizing the health of their patients, especially those at greatest risk of severe disease," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDSA panelists reviewed evidence published in the 18 to 24 months since the evidence base for the last Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations were published (the search was started in June 2024). Most of the evidence was on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel included scientists who specialize in adult and pediatric infectious diseases, including the treatment of immunocompromised patients; vaccines and vaccine research; and transplant medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The panel established one clinical question for the use of each vaccine ('should [virus] vaccine vs no vaccine be used in immunocompromised patients?') and identified patient-importance outcomes for both vaccine effectiveness and adverse events (eg, hospitalization, mortality, progression to severe disease; and serious adverse events, or exacerbation of immunocompromising or autoimmune conditions, respectively)," the news release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With moderate-certainty evidence, the literature review found a link between COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised people and a reduction in related hospitalization. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates, which ranged from 33% to 56% in studies, included one cohort study (VE, 46%) and four test-negative case-control studies (VE, 37%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Less critical illness, death, healthcare use&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination was tied to reductions in critical COVID-19 illness (VE, 40%) and death (VE, 61%), although the evidence was of low certainty, and COVID-related emergency department/urgent care visits (VE, 34%) and outpatient visits (VE, 40%), with moderate certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared clinical decision-making is essential, allowing flexibility in timing and dosing to accommodate immunosuppressive therapy schedules, travel, and individual risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most studies, follow-up time or time since last vaccine dose was relatively short, with a median of less than two months," the guideline authors wrote. "Given that vaccine protection decreases over time, these estimates are likely to represent higher-end values."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several adverse outcomes of interest, such as heart attack and stroke, were less common among vaccinated people. Although cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) were seen in the vaccinated group, the risk was lower than that in their unvaccinated counterparts, likely due to an increased risk of myocarditis due to COVID-19 infection itself. But the authors warn that this estimate was imprecise because cases were rare and because the evidence it was based on was of low certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All immunocompromised individuals aged ≥6 months should receive at least one dose of the current season’s COVID-19 vaccine, with additional doses based on prior vaccination history and clinical judgment," the guideline authors wrote. "Shared clinical decision-making is essential, allowing flexibility in timing and dosing to accommodate immunosuppressive therapy schedules, travel, and individual risk factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They called for future research into, for example, correlates of protection and immunogenicity (ability to provoke an immune response) thresholds for diverse immunocompromised subgroups and vaccine-protection durability and waning in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and evolving immunosuppressive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Researchers say fewer children developed peanut allergies after guidelines were put into place calling for introducing peanut products to young children.

   &lt;p&gt;For years, parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts, to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. But 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/02/23/388450621/feeding-babies-foods-with-peanuts-appears-to-prevent-allergies" target="_blank"&gt;a landmark study&lt;/a&gt; found the opposite to be true, stating that if babies consume peanut products at an early age, they were far less likely to become allergic to them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health experts quickly took notice — and the resulting reversal in pediatric guidance has helped to push peanuts out of the No. 1 spot as the cause of food allergy for children under 3 in the U.S., according to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and" target="_blank"&gt;a new study published&lt;/a&gt; in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Early allergen introduction works," Dr. David Hill, who led the study, tells NPR. "For the first time in recent history, it seems like we're starting to put a brake pedal on the epidemic of food allergy in this country."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Growing concerns over food allergies have reshaped parts of Americans' diet, from schools and camps banning peanut butter in sandwiches to airlines nixing once-ubiquitous bags of salted nuts. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1500186" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; referenced a quadrupling of peanut allergy's prevalence in U.S. children, citing growth from 0.4% in 1997 to more than 2% in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when U.S. health guidance changed in 2015 and 2017, so did that trend, according to Hill, a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who's also an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence," Hill says, "and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He estimates that the changed guidelines have prevented peanut allergies in at least 40,000 children in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The tipping point in peanut allergy prevention dates to 2015, when &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank"&gt;research was published&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to solve a puzzle: Why was peanut allergy 10 times higher among Jewish children in the U.K. than among Israeli children with similar ancestry? Researchers noted that while British and U.S. parents kept their babies away from peanut products, many Israeli parents &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/02/23/388450621/feeding-babies-foods-with-peanuts-appears-to-prevent-allergies" target="_blank"&gt;routinely fed their infants a puffy peanut snack&lt;/a&gt; called Bamba.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The revised recommendations, including in the&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, calls for introducing infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months, in line with advice published in 2017 by the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/addendum-peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the revised guidelines for peanuts and other allergens were published. They did that by analyzing the health data of more than 120,000 children in the U.S. using records from dozens of different pediatric practices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Corinne Keet, a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who works in the epidemiology of food allergy, says she finds the study interesting, even if she's cautious about reading too much into it. She wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm a little bit surprised by these findings because I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more" in the past decade, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for her caution, Keet says, is that her own research has found families haven't been fully implementing the new guidelines, in many cases due to fear that exposing an infant to peanut products might also endanger a sibling or parent who's allergic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keet also says it's simply difficult to conduct a high-quality study about food allergy prevalence. She notes that the influential 2015 study, called &lt;a href="https://www.leapstudy.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;LEAP&lt;/a&gt; (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy), produced definitive results by conducting a large clinical trial following hundreds of young kids over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues acknowledge that their study has limitations, such as relying on diagnostic codes — which aren't necessarily equivalent to actual allergy rates. Their data also does not include information about children's eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, he sees the study as another positive sign that a strategic shift is helping children. The benefits are far-reaching, he adds, because many peanut allergies are a lifetime condition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's highly persistent," Hill says. "Only about 10% of kids who develop a peanut allergy will outgrow that peanut allergy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The team sequenced semen samples from individuals between the ages of 24 and 75, using very high-precision technologies, and found that the male germ line (the line of cells that produce sperm) is subject to a combination of mutation and positive selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The scientists used a duplex sequencing technique called NanoSeq, which can detect rare mutations with a very low margin of error. This allowed them to analyze 81 sperm samples from 57 donors. The results showed that a man's sperm adds an average of 1.67 new mutations every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But the most striking aspect of the study is not limited to the mere accumulation of mutations with age. The authors discovered that the male germ line is subject to positive selection. That is, certain mutations offer an advantage to cells that produce sperm and expand. They identified that many of these mutations are in genes related to developmental disorders or a predisposition to childhood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;"We expected to find evidence that selection influences mutations in sperm," said Matthew Neville, coauthor of the study published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09448-3"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature. "What surprised us was how much the number of sperm carrying mutations associated with serious diseases increases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;What Does This Mean for Children of Older Fathers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers estimated that about 3 to 5 percent of sperm from middle-aged and older men carry some potentially pathogenic mutation in the exome (the coding part of the genome). That represents a higher risk than previous estimates. In more concrete numbers, the estimated fraction for men in their thirties was close to 2 percent, while it reached about 4.5 percent for men in their seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;From the evolutionary and clinical perspective, the implications are significant. Evolutionarily, it shows that the male germ line is not simply a "machine" that accumulates errors: There is a dynamic process of mutation and selection that can modify the genetic “quality” of the sperm with the age of the father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On the clinical side, however, it raises questions about reproductive planning, genetic counseling, and the additional risks associated with an older father. The authors argue that although the percentages remain modest, the the accumulation is not only linear but also has a selection component that favors mutations with the potential to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 18:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQNXhTdWxCQkk1ZDJzLTU2SkVMcFZuSzhyTk9veW15ZDRuRThGdHpSQzY0YnZNQ3ZsVjBaTVZ6elVHcVdLcEk4bW5XTHZaZ2ZERGsyTi12QTZ6V0FWZmtSRGN1Qy1WR29YUGNkN2lVXzZ2MlplTzZoMzd5WnhRUHl0Sm80TQ</guid></item><item><title>听觉声音可能源于大脑对自身内在言语的误读-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/inner-speech-auditory-hallucinations-29840/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may arise when the brain fails to recognize its own inner voice as self-generated. Normally, the brain predicts the sound of one’s inner speech and dampens auditory responses accordingly, but this prediction breaks down in people who hear voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG readings showed that instead of reduced auditory activity, individuals with recent hallucinations had stronger brain responses when imagining speech that matched external sounds. The discovery provides the strongest evidence yet for the misattributed inner speech theory and may pave the way toward early biomarkers for psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Prediction Error:&lt;/strong&gt; The auditory cortex fails to suppress self-generated inner speech, causing the brain to misinterpret it as external sound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EEG Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants with recent hallucinations showed reversed brainwave responses, revealing disrupted prediction mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to biological markers to identify or predict psychosis before full onset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by psychologists from UNSW Sydney has provided the strongest evidence yet that auditory verbal hallucinations – or hearing voices – in schizophrenia may stem from a disruption in the brain’s ability to recognise its own inner voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Schizophrenia Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers say the finding could also be an important step towards finding biological indicators that point to the presence of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is significant as there are currently no blood tests, brain scans, or lab-based biomarkers – signs in the body that can tell us something about our health – that are uniquely characteristic of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Thomas Whitford, with the UNSW School of Psychology, has been examining the role of inner speech in the cognition of healthy people and people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inner speech is the voice in your head that silently narrates your thoughts – what you’re doing, planning, or noticing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people experience inner speech regularly, often without realising it, though there are some who don’t experience it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that when we speak – even just in our heads – the part of the brain that processes sounds from the outside world becomes less active. This is because the brain predicts the sound of our own voice. But in people who hear voices, this prediction seems to go wrong, and the brain reacts as if the voice is coming from someone else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainwave analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Whitford says this confirms what mental health researchers have long theorised: that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may be due to the person’s own inner speech being misattributed as external speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This idea’s been around for 50 years, but it’s been very difficult to test because inner speech is inherently private,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you measure it? One way is by using an EEG, which records the brain’s electrical activity. Even though we can’t hear inner speech, the brain still reacts to it – and in healthy people, using inner speech produces the same kind of reduction in brain activity as when they speak out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in people who hear voices, that reduction of activity doesn’t happen. In fact, their brains react even more strongly to inner speech, as if it’s coming from someone else. That might help explain why the voices feel so real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers divided participants into three groups. The first group included 55 people living with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who had experienced auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in the past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second group of 44 participants also had schizophrenia, but either had no history of AVH or hadn’t experienced them recently. The third group was a control group of 43 healthy people with no history of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant was connected to an EEG (electroencephalography) device to measure brainwaves as they listened to audio over headphones. They were asked to imagine saying either ‘bah’ or ‘bih’ in their minds at the exact moment they heard recordings of one of those two sounds played through headphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had no way of knowing whether the sound they heard in the headphones would match the sound they made in their imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the healthy participants, when the sound that played in the headphones matched the syllable they imagined saying in their minds, the EEG showed reduced activity in the auditory cortex – the part of the brain that processes sound and speech. This suggests the brain was predicting the sound and dampening its response – similar to what happens when we speak out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the group of participants who had recently experienced AVH, the results were the reverse. In these individuals, instead of the expected suppression of brain activity when the imagined speech matched the sound heard, the EEG showed an enhanced response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their brains reacted more strongly to inner speech that matched the external sound, which was the exact opposite of what we found in the healthy participants,” Prof. Whitford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This reversal of the normal suppression effect suggests that the brain’s prediction mechanism may be disrupted in people currently experiencing auditory hallucinations, which may cause their own inner voice to be misinterpreted as external speech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the second group – people with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder who hadn’t experienced AVH recently or at all – showed a pattern that was intermediate between the healthy participants and the hallucinating participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say this is the strongest confirmation to date that the brains of people living with schizophrenia are misperceiving imagined speech as speech that is produced externally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was always a plausible theory – that people were hearing their own thoughts spoken out loud – but this new approach has provided the strongest and most direct test of this theory to date,” Prof. Whitford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the next thing he and his fellow researchers want to assess is if this measure can be used to predict who might transition to psychosis, with the potential to identify people with high risk of developing psychosis, which would allow for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This sort of measure has great potential to be a biomarker for the development of psychosis,” Prof. Whitford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, I think that understanding the biological causes of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a necessary first step if we hope to develop new and effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq

voices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The study suggests it occurs when the brain misidentifies its own inner speech as external speech due to a disruption in how it predicts

Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH)—the experience of hearing voices in the absence of auditory stimulation—are a cardinal psychotic feature of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. It has long been suggested that some AVH may reflect the misperception of inner speech as external voices due to a failure of corollary-discharge-related mechanisms. We aimed to test this hypothesis with an electrophysiological marker of inner speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants produced an inner syllable at a precisely specified time, when an audible syllable was concurrently presented. The inner syllable either matched or mismatched the content of the audible syllable. In the passive condition, participants did not produce an inner syllable. We compared the amplitude of the N1, P2, and P3-components of the auditory-evoked potential between: (1) schizophrenia-spectrum patients with current AVH (SZAVH+, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 55), (2) schizophrenia-spectrum patients without current AVH (SZAVH−, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 44), (3) healthy controls (HC, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 43).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HC group showed reduced N1-amplitude in the Match condition (relative to Passive and Mismatch), replicating our previous results. In contrast, the SZAVH+ group showed the opposite effect: &lt;em&gt;enhanced&lt;/em&gt; N1-amplitude in the Match condition (relative to Passive and Mismatch). The SZAVH− group showed reductions in the Mismatch condition (relative to Passive and Match).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides empirical support for the theory that AVH are related to abnormalities in the normative suppressive mechanisms associated with inner speech. This phenomenon of “inner speaking-induced suppression” may have utility as a biomarker for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders generally, and may index a tendency for AVH specifically at more extreme levels of abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 18:31:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5iZG1sdllqemgyMEZIbl9mQWY3SVdqWTNvb1ctX25waVJFRjRNdXQxUGg4NHVtUlVWRk9CaGxIMzR4ZWYyNktXMjNpUTUyLV85clBFUWdiVEJkWWNPNHM1RnBoeElrUGVXVy14WVVUSVo1SkplMFpBUExJTHo</guid></item><item><title>中风在55岁以下的人群中呈上升趋势。您知道要寻找什么吗？ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Stroke can happen to anyone, at any age and at any time. The number of strokes among younger adults under 55 is rising worldwide, and every day in the UK around 240 people experience the traumatic and life-changing effects of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/stroke-891"&gt;A stroke&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes described by doctors and stroke awareness campaigns as a "brain attack" to help people understand that a stroke is as urgent and life-threatening as a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-attack-2519"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Both happen when blood flow is suddenly cut off, depriving vital tissue of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of stroke. In an ischaemic stroke, blood flow to the brain is blocked, usually by a clot in a blood vessel. Without oxygen, brain cells begin to die, which can cause loss of movement, speech, memory or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;Huge Study Links 99% of Heart Attacks And Strokes With Four Risk Factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a haemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel inside the brain bursts. This is often due to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/high-blood-pressure-6076"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, which weakens blood vessel walls and makes them more likely to rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating a stroke is a race against time because, as doctors say, "&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4921513/"&gt;time is brain&lt;/a&gt;": the longer the brain is starved of blood and oxygen, the more brain cells die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments that can dissolve or remove a clot in an ischaemic stroke or lower dangerously high blood pressure in a haemorrhagic stroke must be given quickly to limit brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a suspected stroke should be taken by emergency services directly to a specialist stroke unit. Patients admitted to these dedicated units tend to have better outcomes because they receive expert care from doctors trained specifically to manage stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to recognise the signs of stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of early recognition of stroke symptoms &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ane.13618"&gt;is linked to&lt;/a&gt; higher mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acronym "Fast" (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) has been a cornerstone of public stroke awareness for more than 20 years. It was developed as a quick screening tool for use before hospital admission, helping people recognise the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/symptoms"&gt;signs of a stroke&lt;/a&gt; and seek urgent medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast highlights the most common warning signs of stroke, but some strokes present differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sure fewer cases are missed, additional symptoms such as dizziness, visual changes and loss of balance have been added, creating the Be Fast acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; = Balance problems. A sudden loss of balance or coordination, dizziness, or a sensation that the room is spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = Eyes. Sudden blurred vision, loss of vision in one or both eyes, double vision, or difficulty focusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; = Face. Facial weakness or unevenness, often with a droop on one side of the mouth or eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = Arm or leg weakness or numbness, often affecting one side of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; = Speech difficulty, slurred speech, trouble finding words, or an inability to speak clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; = Time to call an ambulance. Make a note of when symptoms began, as this helps doctors decide which treatment is most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke symptoms often develop suddenly and can vary from person to person. Some people, particularly women, may experience stroke symptoms that are not included in the Be Fast acronym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are less likely to be recognised as having a stroke because their symptoms can differ from men's. These may include sudden fatigue, confusion, nausea, fainting, or general weakness rather than clear paralysis or slurred speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible signs for any person include a severe headache with no clear cause, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, agitation, or sudden memory loss. In some cases, a person may collapse, lose  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="178338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;, or have a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stroke symptoms last only a few minutes or hours before disappearing completely within 24 hours. This may indicate a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transient-ischaemic-attack-tia/"&gt;Transient Ischaemic Attack&lt;/a&gt; (TIA), sometimes called a "mini stroke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A TIA happens when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted, causing temporary symptoms. The difference between a TIA and a full stroke is that the blockage clears on its own before permanent brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a TIA is still a medical emergency and a serious warning sign that a major stroke could soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Advances in technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17474930241298450"&gt;Telemedicine has become an important tool&lt;/a&gt; in making rapid diagnosis and early treatment possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using secure video links, paramedics can consult with hospital stroke specialists in real time, even while still at the scene or en route to hospital. This allows early diagnosis, faster decision making and immediate preparation for treatment once the patient arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some ambulances now operate as mobile stroke units equipped with brain imaging scanners and clot-busting medicines. In London, &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/facetime-calls-between-doctors-and-paramedics-at-999-call-outs-improves-life-saving-stroke-care-12428277"&gt;video calls&lt;/a&gt; between senior doctors and paramedics at emergency scenes have helped speed up care and direct patients to the most appropriate treatment centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While telemedicine connects specialists to paramedics on the move, other tools are bringing medical help directly to patients within moments of a 999 call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.goodsamapp.org/"&gt;GoodSAM app&lt;/a&gt; was first developed to improve survival after cardiac arrest by alerting nearby trained responders to begin CPR before an ambulance arrives. The platform has since expanded to support other life-threatening emergencies, including stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-blood-type-affects-your-risk-of-an-early-stroke-study-reveals"&gt;Your Blood Type Affects Your Risk of an Early Stroke, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone calls for help, the system identifies clinically trained staff or volunteers in the area and dispatches them to the scene while paramedics are on their way. These responders can provide rapid assessment, basic first aid and reassurance to the patient and family, and can help ensure that key information such as the time symptoms began is ready for the arriving medical team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining digital technology, trained volunteers and rapid communication, the app is helping bridge the critical gap between the onset of symptoms and hospital treatment: the period where, quite literally, every minute matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stroke can strike suddenly and without warning, but quick recognition and immediate medical attention can mean the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning the Be Fast signs and acting immediately could save a life, protect the brain and preserve a person's ability to speak, move and think.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266039/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

One of the leading causes of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, otherwise known as pattern hair loss, which impacts up to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430924/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430924/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="50 percent of both men and women" data-node-id="3.4" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;50 percent of both men and women&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most widespread medications for baldness, which is the active ingredient in products like Rogaine, is minoxidil (originally developed to treat high blood pressure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While this treatment has helped many people grow hair, it does come with a few downsides. Standard treatments typically have poor water solubility and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a61744210/guide-to-eating-for-healthy-skin/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a61744210/guide-to-eating-for-healthy-skin/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; permeability, so some hair growth experts resort to applying minoxidil with microneedling, a technique that punctures small holes in the top layer of the skin to stimulate growth factors and increase the medication’s absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As described in a new study, scientists from China and Australia have developed a dissolving patch that can perform this microneedling work while also delivering a dose of minoxidil to the scalp, and it’s derived from a somewhat unlikely ingredient: Stevioside (STV), the natural &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a18737/sugar-dusted-minerals-just-as-sweet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a18737/sugar-dusted-minerals-just-as-sweet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sweetener" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; derived from the &lt;em data-node-id="7.3"&gt;Stevia&lt;/em&gt; plant. The results of the study were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503575?utm_campaign=publicity_wly&amp;amp;utm_content=wrh_10_6_25&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=muckrack&amp;amp;utm_term=adhm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503575?utm_campaign=publicity_wly&amp;amp;utm_content=wrh_10_6_25&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=muckrack&amp;amp;utm_term=adhm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Advanced Healthcare Materials" data-node-id="7.5" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="7.5.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="7.5.0.0"&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Using STV as a novel solubilizing agent, we incorporated minoxidil into a dissolving microneedle patch, which was used to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of minoxidil and overcome the limitations of traditional carrier single-function approaches,” the authors wrote in the study. “This method not only enhances &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a68120495/easter-island-rapamycin/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a68120495/easter-island-rapamycin/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="drug" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; penetration into skin but also eliminates other issues associated with traditional topical formulations, such as slow onset of action and/or inaccurate dosing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As the authors note, while testosterone doesn’t directly cause baldness, the enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which triggers the apoptosis (or death) of keratin-producing &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65936535/qubit-proteins-cells/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65936535/qubit-proteins-cells/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cells" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in the epidermis. Minoxidil, however, &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10461613/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10461613/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;suppresses certain enzymes and inhibits androgen receptors&lt;/a&gt;, which has the net effect of decreasing the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone. It also boosts aromatase, which converts testosterone into estradiol—a kind of estrogen that further stimulates hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;To test their new idea, researchers used &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a35876748/scientists-grow-mouse-embryo-outside-womb-are-humans-next/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a35876748/scientists-grow-mouse-embryo-outside-womb-are-humans-next/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mouse" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt; models with androgenetic alopecia and tested their new patch against standard treatments. In 35 days, scientists saw hair regrowth in 67 percent of the target area, compared to only 25 percent from the control group—a promising start for this Stevia-based hair loss treatment. Of course, mice are one thing, and humans are another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“While the mouse model results are promising, &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a66068104/immortality-xenotransplantation-human-longevity-research/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a66068104/immortality-xenotransplantation-human-longevity-research/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="human" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Lifeng Kang, a co-author of the study from the University of Sydney, told &lt;em data-node-id="11.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-sweet-trick-could-make-hair-loss-treatments-rogaine-more-potent-2000668902" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://gizmodo.com/this-sweet-trick-could-make-hair-loss-treatments-rogaine-more-potent-2000668902" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gizmodo" data-node-id="11.3.0" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Unwanted hair loss isn’t a thing of the past (at least, not yet), but &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65789451/longer-lasting-clothes-better-wash-cycle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65789451/longer-lasting-clothes-better-wash-cycle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="science" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; has it in its crosshairs—no pun intended.&lt;br data-node-id="12.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="13" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div data-node-id="gallery-carousel" aria-label="Gallery Carousel" aria-roledescription="carousel" role="region" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="PP0-15-0" data-theme-key="carousel-container" class="css-a6tzot e1kgjrvy4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1t3oi0e e1kgjrvy3"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PP0-15-0" data-theme-key="carousel-hed" class="css-4i2xvz e1kgjrvy5"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-79dz2t eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Get Stronger With An Exclusive MH Program&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="inner-carousel" data-theme-key="carousel-inner-wrapper" class="css-cbaigl e1kgjrvy0"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="item" data-theme-key="carousel-item" class="css-m9cksi e1kgjrvy6"&gt;&lt;div class="css-33w51f e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div class="css-u94zfv e1ghppmw16"&gt;&lt;div class="css-9xcc4r e1ghppmw15"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/recomp-landing-page-67733437617bd.png?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=640:*" alt="body recomp central" title="body recomp central" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-s7sxc4 e1ghppmw12"&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-mwacyu e1geg53v2"&gt;COURTESY DAVIDSON; ANDRE L.

The disease affects the macula, or the central part of the retina, and leads to vision loss in the center of the eye. In advanced AMD, a process known as geographic atrophy causes significant damage to retinal cells, which can cause full blindness in that eye. Geographic atrophy affects about &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 million people worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before receiving the implant, it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted," Sheila Irvine, a participant in the study who was diagnosed with AMD, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small clinical trial, 38 European patients with AMD had a small electronic chip implanted under the center of their retina below cells that had died. The chip wirelessly connects to a pair of augmented-reality glasses attached to a small computer that they each wear on their waistbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This setup, called the photovoltaic retina implant microarray or PRIMA system, uses a video camera in the glasses to capture images of text. The glasses then project that image as infrared light onto the implanted chip. Then, the chip converts the light into electrical signals, which the brain interprets as vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Xh5NVpxpMJCWqfLdnit7CN" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Xh5NVpxpMJCWqfLdnit7CN slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9c10684e-0db7-42a9-84b1-f63c6851ac04"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;In a small trial, an implanted chip placed just under the retina's cells is helping adults with age-related macular degeneration read again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Science Corporation)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="13caa200-6dc9-4ad5-86e3-243c1db6f5f1"&gt;"It's a new way of looking through your eyes, and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter," Irvine said in the statement. "It's not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study underwent several months of training to learn to read using the new device. Researchers also encouraged the patients to practice with the device in new ways. Irvine used hers to do crossword puzzles, while another patient used the device to navigate the Paris Metro system. A zoom function on the camera also helps users read fine-print text, such as that on a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ab8279ff-9d3e-483b-bc2b-bcd8ba585400"&gt;The PRIMA system does have some limitations,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doctors.masseyeandear.org/details/146" target="_blank" data-url="https://doctors.masseyeandear.org/details/146" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Demetrios Vavvas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear, who was not involved in the study, told&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tiny-eye-implant-special-glasses-legally-blind-patients-can-read-rcna238488" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tiny-eye-implant-special-glasses-legally-blind-patients-can-read-rcna238488" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;NBC News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In its current form, the device only restores vision in black and white, not color or grayscale, so it can't be used to recognize faces. In addition, it's not yet clear if the device will remain as effective after multiple years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, "as the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients," Vavvas told NBC.&lt;/p&gt;

But what is it about rolling your shoulders and flexing your upper back that brings stress relief? We finally have an explanation, thanks to new &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12441015/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Physiological Reports&lt;/em&gt;. The short answer is that this simple action may trigger the body’s parasympathetic nervous system, providing an almost immediate sense of calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this discovery and how you can use these findings to your advantage, we called up Jorge L. Reyes-Castro, MD, MS, a cardiac electrophysiology fellow in the Department of Medicine at University of Minnesota Medical School and the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you stretch your upper back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, physicians at University of Minnesota Medical School and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine had 24 healthy adults perform a simple upper back and neck stretch. “We asked them to roll their &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-shoulder-exercises-1"&gt;shoulders&lt;/a&gt; back to more or less the level of their ears, while stretching their neck back,” Dr. Reyes-Castro says. Subjects were instructed to hold the stretch for at least 10 seconds, while continuing to breathe normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Reyes-Castro, this stretch resulted in a “substantial” drop in blood pressure—“a dramatic response for just rolling your shoulders,” he says. Crucially, the drop in blood pressure was not accompanied by a meaningful increase in heart rate. “Usually, what you expect in normal physiology is that when you have a drop in blood pressure, you will have a compensatory increase in your heart rate,” he says. “But in this case, the heart rate doesn't increase much, which could potentially contribute to the pleasant sensation that we feel when we stretch our shoulders, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-back-exercises"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;, and neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that this simple stretch triggers a reflex that activates the body’s parasympathetic nervous system. “The nervous system is controlled by two systems—the sympathetic and the parasympathetic,” Dr. Reyes-Castro explains. “When you’re doing anything that is intense, your sympathetic system is dominating. But when you are resting or calm, then your parasympathetic system is activated and the sympathetic system withdraws. So, what you are probably doing with this [stretch] is enhancing and activating the parasympathetic system, resulting in a state of pleasure, relaxation, and calmness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick stress relief whenever you need it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s participants were all seated for the duration of the experiment, Dr. Reyes-Castro says that you can reap the instant feel-good rewards of a quick upper-back stretch while standing or going about your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNdV8xSjdCbDRUaHUtMXFjWkZBZWt1WnFpd0ZnWGMtVVplZEVQbzVJODN0QUU2SVNfRV92WmFxcFZQT2NDWlExeE1Na19iaVRpMVJ4ZU5mZk9uOWxuN1h3ZGNRVjdjLUg4ZnlxN0VkWmVvWWVrVGlYM29LSU45VF8xaEtn</guid></item></channel></rss>
